    "This just proves that talk is not able to be understood by people that are insane and are working to destroy the world for the devil. Kim is an insame little monster. This is tame language from myself. I hope that if he does not change and find God, that he will find the evil devil to take him down to hell forever. He is so sick and evil to his people. Looks like something out of a horror movie come to life.",
    "Has anyone noticed that NoKo seems very confident and not worried about the countries behind the sanctions? China will say one thing and do another. That's why Kim is not worried and still sending up missiles. They have already been assured by China that they will still help them. You can not trust China. Ever! Kim is not afraid. Do you think he'd waste 3 missiles if he thought he couldn't replace them because of sanctions?",
    "Common view is that, NK is boxed in. They have reached the limit of their grandstanding. Piss weak effort. What no firing of those 4 ICBMs this week? NK is boxed into a corner with nowhere to go. This reflects the display of a child with firecrackers who's daddy says, your in big trouble if you fire the bing ones, so the insolent child wonders off sulkily and then fires a few tom thumbs, as a cowering conciliatory response. It seems unlikely NK will ever launch multiple ICBMs at once, as that would NOT be seen as testing, but rather an extremely aggressive and threatening act of military aggression and intimidation towards other nations. NK is now boxed in and have pretty much gone as far as they can, without triggering a major military response against them. It looks like NK has rolled its last dice and the numbers don't look good.",
    "NK focus is on missiles,  one nuke on Washington DC and the US is fucked and it will be in civil war for 100 year, this all China main goal, i am sure NK have 100+ of these from China.  It is not worth the risk, fuck NK and SK and Japan, let them deal with it, we need to get out, this is a Chinese trick.  We don't need to die for SK.",
    "none of you guys seem to have any clue. It's not that they're \"pullin back a little bit\", they're not stupid to be throwing missiles at Guam and get themselves destroyed since they are not already for that kind of War yet and while Trump was angry , he'll destroy them. However , they're not stopping what they're doing then until the time is right, until they have all the nuclear weapons that they need, they work start shooting missiles at us when we are off guard and proud like  idiots. Why cant you just get that? Do not ever underestimate the enemy and be stupid and off-guard completely when the whole country is at stake and it could be destroyed in minutes when we least expect it. it's all about being dumb or not. they're probably more strategic than simple minded people. they are not what it seems to be. does a snake stay right infront of its prey every time, make lots of noises, and  tell its prey ahead of time when it will attack it or it will hide somewhere hidden, quietly, calmly, and suddenly attack U and devour U alive when U least expect it??? use your heads!!!",
    "If you think North Korea is to blame for this conflict, you're a brainwashed puppet of the deep state and the military industrial complex. You must stop trying to get your news from the propaganda mills (mainstream press) and start by learning a bit of history. North Korea has not invaded any countries in the last 50 years. The USA assassinates foreign leaders, engages in regime change, incites civil wars, bombs innocent civilians EVERY SINGLE YEAR. It's always the other side's fault (Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Serbia, Venezuela, Russia, China, etc).  Over 200 military interventions in other nations in America's brief history and the average American cannot see what's really going on. You invade nations the size of a golf course like Grenada, you invade Panama because the CIA's drug partner president no longer wanted to play ball. LOL. You make up lies about \"weapons of mass destruction\" to start trillion dollar wars that kill and displace millions. The list is just too long to not face reality. America has missiles at Russia's doorstep (we'd cry bloody murder and threaten all out nuclear war if they did that to us) and now this Korean crisis is an opportunity to have missiles at China's doorstep in South Korea. Those THAAD missiles are useless against North Korea's primitive and conventional weapons. We aim to provoke and bully Russia and China. Scary stuff that the propaganda mills do not mention.\nNorth Korea cannot strike first because if they do, they all get to die. But a paranoid Russia or China can make an honest mistake and end us. Nobody mentions this is in our dishonest media.",

There really isn't much Trump supporters are not scared to death of. Seriously Trump supporters can any of you answer why you weren't all killed by the Obama Ebola you were positive was coming to get you? Can any of you Trump supporters answer why Obama didn't declare martial law, stay in office, confiscate all your guns, and Jade Helms your rears in to FEMA concentration camps as you were absolutely positive that he was going to do?

    "I intend to include this on the pence post I accidentally posted the wrong comment on as well.\n\nSermon:\n\nMany claim we need world peace, tolerance, and acceptance.\n\nI disagree. \n\nWe need repentance. The act if identifying in what ways we go against our morality. We all do it. We go against our moral compasses for petty selfish reasons. We forsake our conscience and add to the condition of this place we share. Those who go against what their moral compasses are now the majority. Given, those acts may range from minor things like lying to major violations like pedophilia or rape. But we all do it. Each in our portion and because the majority of the world does this... We find ourselves falling. \n\nWe helplessly cry to leaders who are also guilty... And expect them to somehow make everyone stop doing it. We expect them, a small and powerless few, to force us to follow our conscience without telling us what we don't want to hear. That we are all to blame. \n\nIndeed. The world needs repentance. We need to stand up and begin to take personal responsibility for or portion. We need to think deeply and with our hearts and identify where we have strayed from our conscience..  Be it throwing a piece of litter in the ground or hitting an animal, be it screaming at a spouse or allowing our tempers to get the better of us, or stealing, or lying, or being unfaithful... We need to identify it in whatever way we do it..  And stop. \n\nThe more if us that do this the closer we get to making the world better... And the more of us who refuse to simply sit silently about it, who explain what repentance actually means, and what it accomplishes... The more likely we are to turn the majority toward what is right.\n\nToo often we hate ourselves for what our conscience tells us is wrong. We make excuses to ignore it. But indeed we have that moral compass for a reason. It is a gift. It is a major factor in turning this hellish nightmare into a heavenly world for all of us.  But we must be dedicated and honestly do so or there will be no effect.\n\nWhen 9 out of 10 of all liars become honest, we will have a more honest world.\nWhen 9 out of 10 people step away from the crowd to stop a rape we will have less rape.\nWhen 9 out of 10 of us refuse to allow ourselves to succumb to violent tempers then we will have less violence.\nWhen 9 out of 10 of us refuse to hate there will be less hate. \n\nWhen nine out of every ten people on earth repent... Good will finally reign again. \n\nThose who do repent will be blameless. They are not contributors. They stand against evils and wrong doings. They stand as examples. And mark my words when 9 out of ten of us talk about how good another person is and how honorable and virtuous... That will ensure that children want to grow up to be like that.\n\nThe world needs repentance. Anyone who tells you otherwise or who blames others is a liar and either doesn't realize the truth of the matter or is covering up their own shame in the matter. \n\nWe are Christians. Repentance is the way to salvation. And if we falter may we quickly realize it and correct it. \n\nThis is why Jesus said his disciples do not sin. They know what happens. \n\nAnd should the call for repentance be ignored surly we'll destroy ourselves. So stop being weakened. Look at your influences, look at the messages and then away from such vulgarity for your sake and for the sake of your children and all life present on this earth. \n\nDon't allow yourself to be convinced that what you know is wrong is right or that what you know is evil should be called good. \n\nYou know. Your moral compass is a gift that allows you to see clearly. May nine out of ten of us repent and pave the way with full honor toward the world we desire. \n\nAmen.",
    "(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) \nAnd take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,\nCasting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;\n............Not guns......\nFor to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

    "All 3 guests on here are obviously not \"tech people\".  Ben Collins doesn't even know what the hell he is talking about.  Firmware is a type of software, typically used to update the operating systme, in this case iOS.  It's hardware and software man, Firmware is a form of software.  He is probably thinking of the apps as software which is also true.\n\n The government is basically DEMANDING that Apple circumvent it's own security, by bypassing, removing or hence working around its securities built in to the operating system for personal user privacy and protection.  They claim it would only be used once, but if someone at the FBI were able to get that version of software backed up, they could use that on any other iPhone to bypass anyone's security, with or without persmission.  This could lead to such things as more government eavesdropping, tracking where anyone goes, who they are talking to, talking pictures without the phone user even knowing, listening in on conversations without persmission.  Basically the government is wanting Apple to help them spy on more Americans without us being aware of it.\n\nThe encryption was brought more about after our own government got ratted on by Snowden, because, as usual, they were majorly over-stepping their bounds.  If Apple is made to comply, next the government will force Google, then it's game over for the major players.  If Apple complies with this, it will have MAJOR impacts on them as a company.  I am not a fan of Apple, never owned an iPhone and never will, but I sure as shit will side with them on this, it's a matter of principle.  The government has gone from a government of the people by the people and for the people, to a tyrannical government that thinks it can do anything it damn well pleases.  If anything I hope this makes the people revolt against the government to comply with the laws set forth to keep this a peaceful nation without civil unrest.",

Is it possible it could be rigged, I would say it is possible.",

    "What Fox should offer to do, is create a couple of extra debates on nights when people will watch, and see if Hillary will accept them.

Is it just a coincidence that the debates are scheduled in a manner and on a schedule almost identical to the way the Democratic Primary Debates were set up?  Wow, another \"coincidence\" that favors the Clinton Mafia.  She is afraid of press conferences and she benefits from debates schedules so that they will have high viewership.  What does it say when a major party's nominee has been advised to duck the press and avoid exposure because they undermine her support.",
    "That don't mean shit, just look at what power Hillary has over the FBI. Man you guys are stupid for even trying to sound like any of this is not rigged.

What Trump did to his GOP opponents will be nothing to the slaughter Hillary will suffer, she has given him so much ammo its almost unfair. LA Times/USC Daybreak poll which has VERY fair methods including asking about third party and switching up where their names are on the question order and a very large sample, has Trump up 6.1% AFTER her convention bounce, she was down 7.3%! by the way if you hit 8% post convention studies show you have a 95% chance of winning. Look at some other polls methods such as Washington Post which polls more Democrats than typical polls, other tricks used is limiting non urban responses, not giving third party choice and always having preferred candidate (Hillary) listed first (studies show candidate listed first can gain as much as a 5% bounce). The manipulated way polls are done is why we have seen such bad polling pre-primary such as Hillary supposedly up 20-25% in polls in Michigan yet Sanders won by several %, the reason is they dont ask any independents or limit their number and often ask groups that have historically bad turnout at the polls such as minorities, yet under interview older voters who have excellent voter turnout.",

    "...that's what the system allows, is the argument against Trump that, in order to be patriotic, you ought to pay more than you are required to pay, is that what they Clinton people are saying, what is their argument exactly?... someone telling me that, even though it is perfectly legal for you to avoid paying these taxes, you should pay them anyway, I just don't buy it. [who does that?]As long as you are obeying the law, if you can get your federal income taxes down to zero, more power to you.",
    "Everbody is doing stories on this but none of them seem to have read the story. The times  article says there guessing that he hasn't paid any federal taxes. There's no proof of this only the filing that he lost X amout of money in 1995. That leads them to speculate that he might not have paid any fed. taxes for twenty years. I don't really care either way it's just somebody should have verified that he hasn't before they all put out stories about it.",

Recycle metals for gas money, and so on and so forth. There are just too many people and too much thinking that the world owes them something. That could not be farther from the truth. It is those people that will be old and sitting on a bench somewhere blaming the world for their miserable existence but, in the final analysis, that is some people.

    "When any company incurs a capital loss for a taxable year, the profits accrued in following years are not subject to taxation until the carry-loss is equal to the profits made in subsequent years, or the carry-loss forward timetable has lapsed. I have capital losses that offset capital gain, too. Trump had major capital and personal losses at the height of real-estate collapses. Many experienced those losses, also...their home value was underwater, for instance. Had a homeowner sold his property for less than he paid, he would too, show a capital loss. Capital loss offsets capital gain. It is written into our body of tax law.",
    "The idea that a business shouldn't be able to write off past years losses is assinine.   Most businesses don't make a profit in the initial years.

One where you've lost say, a million dollars and therefore have no tax debt or one where you made a million dollars and have to pay half of it in taxes?

Programs that divert funds from homeless programs, work study programs, employment assistance,  medical care, elderly programs, and so forth.

That the U.S. will receive them with open arms.\" Apparently some wealthy person (s), are paying for those  comercials, in multiple countries in central America.

Illegal immigration is draining all of our resources in the U.S. and most of the immigrants who have legal status now are informing these people that it's okay to do this because they did it. This is the only situation I agree with Trump about. Americans would never be allowed to just invade another country illegally and not suffer the consequences. All other countries problems becomes the U.S. problems but again we are not going to just be allowed to bully our way over into their countries no matter how hard it gets over here because it will if all of these folks are allowed entry without knowing a thing about them. \n\nhese folks have had a plan for years and thus far I see it has worked for many of them. It started off as hire them because their labor is cheap. Now it's replace them with others in the work force because we can exploit them with using their immigration status over their heads. Then allowing them to speak Spanish in the workplace. Now they are taking advantage of the U.S.'s lack of border man power to stop what it looks like almost a half of a country in Central America trying to break through Mexico to enter into the U.S. when we already have such a huge homeless issue here. They are just abandoning their kids and risking having their children taken from them just to get over here. I could never ever do that to my kids no matter what. I say why have children if you care more about yourself than their safety. \n\nWhat other country allows outsiders to invade their country illegally and automatically give them rights. As long as they can find some attorney to help them with their citizenship or a family to hide them out they can come to the U.S. and live illegally for the duration of their lives and then cry when they get caught by using the excuse they are law biding and hard working. You are definitely not law biding if you entered through illegal immigration. So the fact that someone hired you anyway under these conditions still does not make what you did right or fair to the citizens of the U.S. The U.S. needs to tighten up on their laws and be more consistent with enforcing laws that should stop illegal immigration.\n\nPenalize the folks here in the U.S. that are helping to make illegal immigration worse. I will not and refuse pay any tax dollars to help them break the law. I see many foreigners complain about the U.S. but yet they are still dying to get here by any means necessary!

With all due respect to the former president, he is such a dirtbag. What he's doing is unprecedented. He could have at least waited a few months. People say Trump is a narcissist, and he is one no doubt, but that's nothing compared to Obama.

All lives matter.\n\nMost people that do crimes do not have any respect, because they was not taught respect are rebelled against respect... So they are sending video's to make America hate our police officers that protect us.\n\nI taught my Son when he was growing up to respect the law. To always humble yourself before them. Show Respect.  Say yes sir, and no sir, when asked a question with respect,  when talking to our Authority!\n\n Never talk back to a rude police officer, when getting stopped. Because there job is very dangerous. And they are under a lot of stress. Because alot of their police friends  have been killed by Random stops. So there life is in danger every time they stop someone. \n\n They don't know if you are gonna kill them are not at any random stop.\n So I taught my Son, to  be humble, show respect.... Even if the police officer is rude.\n\nIf you give the police officer kindness and respect. The officer gives you respect back. But even if he does not still humble yourself and show respect even when they are rude.\n\nFor their job is so dangerous, they get killed even on house calls trying to protect a wife from being beat up...\n\n     But our younger generation talks back to all Authority. Speaking with disrespect to parents, teachers in school etc!!! And they get by with it. So when a distressed police officers who protect us and see so much crime and hate, and disrespect to the law. They become rude. Because maybe there police buddies got killed just for traffic stops. \n\n      I respect our police officers, they protect us. Just think if they was not there. \n\n     Considering the Ferguson police officer that shot Michael Brown. \n\n   Michael Brown, should have been taught respect not going into stores robbing and acting like a fool roaming the streets late at night showing off,  because he stoled cigars and got by with it....He never showed the police officer respect. If he would of showed respect, it would of been a minor  misdemeanor. Jail overnight, and freed by morning. Maybe the jail time would taught him a lesson and keep  Michael Brown off the streets at that time of the morning. And he would have gotten \n a government grant like Dr. Ben Carson and study and make something out of his life. \nDr. Ben Carson a black man that  came from the ghetto ! Instead of running the streets he chose to put a book in his face.  And look at him today, a very respected Godly Black Man!\n\nI respect Dr Ben Carson, and I wish he  would have become  president!  One day he will!!!    I believe that in my heart. Because Dr. Ben Carson can teach Americans how to respect and love each other again, and not be rebellious and blame others for own rebellion... This black DOCTOR BEN CARSON is the best role model for us all!!!!!!\n      WE NEED TO TEACH RESPECT AND LOVE AGAIN TOWARD EACH OTHER....\n\n   If my Son, showed that kind of disrespect to a store robbing them and running the streets disrespecting police officers, he would have been shot too. SO THIS  IS NOT ABOUT A  RACE THING!!!\n\n   Myself, as a parent would be the blame. Because I did not teach him respect that would have saved his life!\n\nDr Ben Carson, was raised in the getto. But his mother put books in his face 24/7. And would not let him run the streets. Being from a poor family. He got government grants!  \n  But I thank God for Dr. Ben Carson's mother, that not only made him read books while his friends was roaming the streets of the getto,. But taught him about God and Respect!!!\n\nWhen Dr. Ben Carson stabbed a young boy at the time he was the same age with fierce anger.... he repented and locked himself in the bathroom and read \"The Book of Proverbs for 3 hours\"...that taught him not to run with fools, and do not be a fool!  \n   I believe that changed Dr Ben Carson's life forever! And God was with his repented heart!\nAnd raised him up this day for an example for us all! \n    HE GAVE RESPECT THROUGH CHRIST, HIS SAVIOUR, AND TODAY IS RESPECTED BY ALL!!!\n\nALL LIVES MATTER!\n\nYes, the FBI, do justice!\n\nLOVE ALL\nRespectfully \nMinister Sudegayel,\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n \n\n",

    "With Trump's election, himself the son of a fervent klansman, far-right extremist violence has spiked in the US to far beyond any vestige of comparability with islamic extremism, which has typically been far more rare and violent in number of deaths. Far-right extremism is by far a bigger threat to society. But I think the biggest threat of all which motivates the disaffection that can lead to far-right mentalities is a lack of jobs and Trump's era has seen job creation slow to a level not seen since the start of the decade. I think ultimately this sort of rhetoric is just a bandaid and part of a larger strategic move to encourage people to think maybe there might be reasons to give up on net neutrality (wrong).

In addition, by giving Iran a place at the table, Obama created leverage over Saudi Arabia, to take them to task over the kind of behavior that Trump is presently excusing.\nTrump is incompetent, and he is unraveling a masterful long term framework that he inherited from Obama.

From watching this video, it's easy to see that the Russian investigation is unreasonable and Trump is not doing anything wrong, but once you start combining it with other sources you'll start to see a bigger picture. I'm not going to assume Trump's guilt as he did with Hillary (lock her up), but I will say that I believe there's more going on here than meets Hannity's eye. None of us can say whether or not there was collusion, but that's the point of Mueller's investigation. There are a lot of people watching very closely, and the fact is if Mueller did something constitutionally wrong, the GOP would bring a lawsuit against him quicker than you can say \"but her emails!\" So I think we can all rest assured that by the end of this investigation, Trump will either be proven innocent or guilty.

    "Hannity wants Hillary Clinton to be prosecuted based on lies that he and Schweizer and Trump told about her. None of the \"crimes\" he alleges here about Hillary Clinton are true. Every single one of these claims have been investigated, re-investigated and are now being investigated again, at least for the last year. Not a single indictment. Not a single prosecution. NOTHING. The Republicans even had the investigation and the investigators of Clinton, investigated! Nothingburger again!\n\nFBI investigators combed through all of her emails and found that a few hundred out of tens of thousands, \"should have been classified\" because of their content. They second guessed her. Know why she will never be prosecuted for that? Because, as Secretary of State, SHE had the authority to classify or declassify material, unlike lower level people. \n\nThe claim that she deleted emails that were under subpoena is completely bogus. She didn't delete them. Her lawyers and State Dept lawyers went through them to determine if any were personal. Both the government lawyers and her lawyers signed affidavits that the emails being deleted were personal. \nNone of that material was under subpoena at the time that they made the decision to delete them. They ordered a staff member to delete them, and he deleted them after a subpoena was sent because he wasn't informed that the subpoena was sent, and he had authorization to delete them. Republicans have tried to characterize that completely legal transaction as a scandal, because they are liars and they wanted to have a scandal.\n\nThe process he describes, smashing up phones, using bleachbit: It's a standard practice for destroying devices that previously were used for official purposes, to protect national security. Hannity and the other liars have repeated this nonsense in order to try to pin something on Hillary Clinton. All that it proves is that, once again, Republicans are liars.\n\nHannity continues to lie about the Clinton Foundation. All of their taxes were made public. The Clintons don't operate like the Trump family. The Trump family operate like organized crime. There is nothing to investigate about the Clinton Foundation, because all of the records are in order. There are no discrepancies to suggest what Hannity pretends to be true. They were not profiting from the Foundation. It's a nonprofit!\nBill Clinton's business giving speeches was a separate organization.  Know what proves that? His taxes and records, which have been investigated.\nAll of these claims were already investigated. Nothing there. Sessions tasked a US Attorney to investigate them again,  a year and a half ago. Go ahead and see if there has been ANYTHING resulting from that investigation. Grand Jury? Indictments? Criminal charges? No no and NO. \n\nHannity is a liar, and I really hope that he is indicted along with Stone for pushing the Seth Rich story, which was a cover story that the Russian bots used to distract attention from the crimes of Russian military officers (hacking the DNC, DCCC and the Clinton campaign.)\n I would love to see this liar Hannity lose all of the ill-gotten gains he has accumulated for being an unrepentant LIAR and a conspirator with our enemies. I would love to see him spend everything he has trying to defend himself, and still go to jail. Good riddance to this human sewer of filth.",

And, of course he didn't DO anything in regards to having Mrs. Clinton and James Comey prosecuted, because he would have been impeached if he had! \nAnd, you may be 'hard' on SA, but Trump is NOT. Oh gee, one thing Trump doesn't agree with you on! \n\nSo, tell us, Mr. Hannity, WHAT is it that the United States is getting from Trump ass kissing these autocrats, like the Crown Prince, Putin and Kim Jong Un?

Brock transferred the properties to corporate vehicles that sold them on to the Hannity-linked company. Brock pleaded guilty in 2016 to federal charges of bank fraud and conspiracy for his role in an operation to rig foreclosure auctions between 2007 and 2012.

But more surprising is there are so many uninformed, ignorant, small minded low IQ, weak easily manipulated fools.! Someone please explain! For several centuries with President Trump in the spotlight not ONE person had a negative statement about President Trump let alone being a racist.. with still not one evidence.. white supremacists ties.. not one evidence of.. Russian ties / collusion with not one evidence of.. mentally ill without any evidence, remember conveniently 1 day after the debate Trump invited Billy's rape victims all of a sudden 10 from several decades at the same time came out with criminal sexual abuse charges that just so you too many obvious idiots who need to actually be informed.. they disappeared in the wind. Why? Oh because everyone of where quickly debunked and PROVEN false paid for lies and of course Gloria when the checks stopped the young lying piece of crap from apprentice came forward that Gloria paid her to make up and amazingly its leaked that she has been proven to do several times in past ruining people's life's with lies and deceit for $ and stardom. So does this start to show real from fake yet? Ok. Where is Russia collusion evidence? Proven killary and Barry actually where colluding. And racism? Oh Tyson, Hershel Walker , omarosa and many more have publicly stated over centuries what Trump has done behind The scenes because unlike al and Jesse it's actually about helping others because he cares for people not making him $. Idiots.. and I can go on and on with actual proven facts but it's amazing what some can just decide is real. If you dumb ass people would actually take the time to find proven factual things.. or cared enough about your country and the people it does take a little work because it's hidden as well as possible you would find out that President Trump.. under the most corrupt organizations has completed more for you or should I say hard working Americans in the shortest time as decades of Presidents before with all working diligently every second of every day to complete anything anyway something to discredit president Trump and not one little small even questionable evidence hence the change of direction of what is every single day for months. Oh and have you paid attention to now proven with more everyday facts that Barry and minions did illegally wiretap Trump tower, anything and everything and everyone trump. And everyone who lied .. including the worthless sociopath Comey. You might not like Presidents system of communication. But that's because he is actually the first in a very long time who is not FAKE and actually is not in politics for $$$$ and power. Watch Oprah interview from I believe late 80's early 90's and you can tell even she adored him and asked if he would ever run for said only if the country was in turmoil and needed help to throw away the root of all evil. Understand that FBI, CIA, MSM. Homeland.. what a joke those actually in power put in place several years ago to take away your freedom to have a opinion on a post on YouTube. Look into public records of what Barry and Killary along with several others have done over 8 years to set up what reality is today. WTFU.

They will even block other people's driveways. He said that one time an Asian actually parked along side a space beside his parked car in his driveway. He told me that this is so bad in his neighborhood, as he walks his dog around the block twice a day, that he has to walk out into the street to get around the cars blocking the sidewalk. Asians and Hispanics are the predominant residents of those single family houses but he has noticed that there are actually several families living in those houses. They often enter the residences through side gates. They have also built extra doors to enter back bedrooms. This is illegal overcrowding caused largely by an influx of aliens..most likely illegal aliens. So, it is very hypocritical of those local news stations to berate illegal parking when they also support Sanctuary Cities. My friend says he will vote for anyone who will get rid of these illegal aliens and enforce parking and enforce single family occupancy of single family houses.",

Trump would not be able to run for President without Putin, he would not have a Trump Tower or a Slovenian silicon dead-eyed sexbot. He would be lost without Putin. He needs Putin. But Putin is still Putin with or without Trump. Trump is doing Putin's bidding, and his campaign is taking orders from Putin's right-hand Manafort. Trump has fallen for the standard mobster ploy, he took their money when he was desperate and now he has to take the dive. If you pay your bookie you not \"using\" him to keep your leg from getting broken, he is using you to serve him! The Manchurian candidate thought he was operating independently, but was actually guided by the invisible hand and iron will of his masters. Trump fits that description and you should not dismiss it after such an outstanding job reporting the facts. Just connecting the dots from your own stories makes it impossible to deny.\u00a0PLEASE look into how Manafort was brought on board by Jared Kushner, who took over the family business when his father went to jail and who has highly leveraged real estate projects in Brighton Beach and other Russian Mob hangouts.",
    "Retrieve the emails? From where? The server is dead. Besides, the emails were about yoga, etc. And, IF Russia has them from way back when, they are suppose to hand them over as per our treaty. Glad the media and the entire DNC frauds were jacked by Trump today.",

The server is in some FBI lab, off line and cannot be hacked into. The assertion that Trump is asking the Russians to hack into the server now is beyond stupid. The only time they could have hacked into the server was when Hillary was still secretary of state and the server was active. They either already have the emails, or they never had them and will never have them. If the Russians were able to get the emails when Hillary was secretary, they should them turn over to the FBI. The only political thing about that is, what the emails contain.",

Russia should not have had any access to them at all.  But Hillary refused to use a .gov email account thus now Russia has emails so sensitive their release would be espionage.  But Hillary would be the source.  Not Donald.\n\nEven Congress will never know the contents unless Russia releases them.

    "I am a 63 year old moderate independent voter and a retired U.S. Army Master Sergeant (1972-1993). At the time that our founding forefather drafted the 2nd amendment of the constitution there was little difference between civilian weapons, which were all single shot, and military weapons. The technology for a personal weapon to rapidly shoot could also not be envisioned at that time and semi-automatic weapons didn\u2019t come onto the scene until 1885 almost a hundred years later. I am a firm believer in the 2nd amendment but I think if our founding forefathers could have foreseen the level of killing technology that has come about since they drafted that amendment they would have used less broad language in that amendment and provided some restrictions on the level of firepower allowed to the individual. Too many of the weapons I see being sold today look and function exactly like what they are; weapons of war designed for mass killing. Under the current 2nd amendment NOTHING is restricted to the individual and if we go to the logical extremes of that broad language why not allow individuals ANY weapon of war such as grenade launchers, machine guns, rocket launchers, etc? That amendment has served us well since the 1700s, but the technology of today has made it contrary to the safety of our society. It is well past time to revise the language of that amendment to account for technological changes that have occurred since it\u2019s drafting. We cannot keep pushing a policy of \u201call or nothing\u201d in defense of the existing 2nd amendment. We must use some common sense on the level of killing technology allowed to the individual, or risk continuing harm to our citizens and police, who find themselves often outgunned, by such weapons.",

I don't hear any complaints or demands for this and never have, which again, makes no sense at all if \"SAFETY FOR OUR CHILDREN\" is actually the real issue here??? ***SOLUTIONS: #1: Why can't we just hire at least one Armed Security Guard at each school? That would be the simplest answer to this problem and it would CREATE MORE JOBS in the process! Jewelry Stores, High End Stores and Banks have them so why are these things considered more important than our children??? #2: Seatbelts on all school buses #3: ANYONE MAKING HARMFUL/MALICOUS\u00a0THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA/PUBLIC PLACES SHOULD IMMEDIATLY BE ADDRESSED BY THE POLICE/FBI AND ALL WEAPONS IN THAT PERSONS POSSESION SHOULD BE CONFISCATED IMMEDIATELY!!!! These are all good questions, logical questions and needed questions to be asked and addressed by the public on all sides and by the President.",

The left doesn't think marriage is important, or God, or the Bible. Morality and family values don't come from the sky. The only thing the right can do is keep winning people over by making convincing arguments and living by example cos those the elites on the left who systematically created this problem, will never change!",

    "Wow Tucker- I hope you read some of the comments. Full of Gender hate. Sad.There is no need to spur such hate, and a gender war is just what liberals do. Have you changed sides? We all need to work, we all need to feed our families. We all try to gain a job that will allow us to live. And when we loose a job we go looking for another and hope to find one even when it takes a very very long time. That is NOT gender related. That is HUMAN related. The trick to dealing with employment issues is to gain education in an area that you love - be it white collar or blue collar, a plumber or electrician is highly successful and will always be needed. In fact there is a shortage of linemen for the power companies, not enough electricians, and they make good money. Nurses, both male and female, CNA's can get jobs ANYWHERE. \n\nBut this is just sad, pitting genders. Not good, not good at all. Women do make less in many areas, not all, but many. I was a manager of a bolt store, the men I worked with made much more than I, and when I asked the owner why, his answer: They need to feed their families. So although I had more responsibility, had been there longer, and was older, worked longer hours, and did the job of a manager, I was paid less - I know I did payroll too - he would not give me a raise for I was a woman. I still stayed, I needed the job. But I went and got more education so I could find another.  Wage inequality exists. And anger about it or denying it, is just blind and dumb.\n\nHowever, THIS is not about that, this is about Tucker creating an unnecessary Gender war. So sad.",

The Fijians and Samoans were black.  China even had black slaves and this is how the black skin color began to change over time to a lighter tone.  It's real folks!!!

For a couple million I will \" act \" like I give a rip about Ben and Jennifer's situation.",

    "Look at these women trying to throw him under the bus, you would think that Ben never had an existence oh as a human being now or what before. I cannot really comment on Jennifer Garner as I don't know much about her, as she smartly stays pretty quiet as about. Where Ben and his buddy Matt have been pretty vocal in areas, so I know enough about them not to like their views oh too much. They are basic libtards. But to sit there and try to make the dude seem like a slobbering baboon who just got hit by a car and Nurse Jennifer or Princess Jennifer is there to heal the wounded beast, really sounds silly. I am back to hating FOX no matter how much they seem to support Trump as President. I am a Trump supporter. I cannot trust any of Satan Stream media. Why oh talk about meaningless shit like this. Who cares that Ben Affleck has a drug problem beyond his family, friends? I know that I here don't. It is his own problem. Not mine. I wish him luck and that he turns to true healing through Jesus and gets real help through admitting he has a problem and what, and goes to AA meetings or what else.  We have not even solved 9/11 yet in this country and. We let real crimes go on, and just let them take a floater right in front of our eyes. While Fox news reports this kind of crap as still.

And later publicly thanked Mel Gibson at an awards ceremony he hosted. Saying that once sober it was Gibson, who himself dealt with similar personal problems, who gave RDJ a chance again when no one else in Hollywood did.  That being said, Afflek comes off as very narcissistic and pretentious in interviews and in public. Which makes it hard for me to fully appreciate his talents.

Along with maturity our paths can get narrower because what we listen to is simpler and comes as a one sided acceptance of certain rights and wrongs.

Global warming bs isn't what they tell you. Coal doesn't have the effect they say it does or to the extent they claim it does. But what shutting down coal does do is raise energy prices artificially, it raises the cost of commercial goods because of the new cost of energy involved in moving those goods around. \n\nSo the end result, you pay more for gas, electric, and food. It raises the cost of practically everything and it's a very purposeful move on their part doing this. She agrees with the current administration to the point she talked about obama making a good Supreme Court Justice... could you imagine the damage that would be done then?

    "The reality is that capitalism creates a system where your amount of wealth signifies your degree of power. More wealth = more power. That means those at the top hold their wealth to hold their power (and try to gain more wealth for more power). Capitalism allows for many opportunities for all, but it is important to remember wealth and power can be like drugs in the hands of bad people. They are not healthy for the human psyche, it removes people from the greater human reality. If you have a government that supports that wealth and power and does not cap it at a point to allow for wealth circulation, then the system becomes incredibly corrupt and there will always be a motive to be the most wealthy and most powerful. Until we all get honest and realise this system is a failed system unless we integrate some elements of other systems like socialism, we are all headed for a bleak, black earth. \n\nIt is really simple. We, as humans, made mistakes in the past with socialism and communism etc. But as much as there are mistakes to learn from, there are good things to learn as well. And right now with just a lack of humility and fear of failure, we are stuck, stuck in this perpetual motion of blame, anger, frustration. And once it boils over, which it will unless we all find a way to work together. Then you have a very very hot recipe for civil war. And in this current course, it is looking more and more inevitable. Which is horrible to watch. It is like watching a train crash and being able to stop it but just letting it happen.",

Then they essentially handle the debts and liabilities over the storm and finally sell the bank back to the private sector when the bank is healthy again.

    "Erwin Brothers Film School in Alabama\nPosted: Friday 26 June, 2009\n\n    0\nby Angela Walker\n\nJon and Andy Erwin, veterans of more than a decade in film and television production, today announced the formation of their film school in Birmingham, Alabama. The film school runs July 13 - 16, with advanced labs taking place on July 17 and 18.\n\nLike Us on Facebook \nThe curriculum covers the entire spectrum of filmmaking from story idea and inception of the project to finished product. All classes will take place at Workplay, the largest soundstage in Alabama. From film equipment to Final Cut editing suites and sessions with the new Red One digital camera, all parts of the course will be intensive hands-on training.\n\nParticipants in the Advanced Lab will intern on the production of Life After, a new national television series developed by Jon and Andy, due to be released in the fall.\n\nFor complete information on the film school, download this .PDF file or visit the Film School website.\n\nAbout the Erwin Brothers\n\nJon and Andy Erwin (The Cross and the Towers) began their careers in film and TV over 13 years ago, working as camera operators for ESPN and ABC. As teenagers, they formed their own production company and began to produce local commercials and promotional videos. Now, over a decade later, their vast portfolio includes award-winning music videos, documentaries, short films, reality TV shows and dramatic series. Their clients include ABC, ESPN, FOX, Warner Brothers, Sony Music, and many more.\n\nThey are better known for their work in the music industry, having directed music videos and concerts for multi-platinum artists like Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Switchfoot and Third Day, as well as  winning the 2008 Dove Award for Christian Music Video Of The Year for their collaboration with Casting Crowns on their hit single \"Slow Fade,\" from the film Fireproof.\n\nCurrently the Brothers are editing a provocative documentary they shot in the Galapagos Islands called ORIGINS: The Mysterious Islands - a project that came from a collaboration with Doug Phillips and Vision Forum. They also just wrapped principal photography on the first three episodes of Life After, a dramatic series airing on the new Halogen Network later this year. Other recent\nwork includes God Provides, a Biblical film project staring veteran actor Dean Jones (Herbie).",

First: women in Saudi Arabia are not allowed to drive a car. Second: women are subjected to a \"male guardianship\" system in which they require approval from a male relative (husband, father, etc...) for things like traveling abroad and other important decisions in their lives. Prison time and sometimes corporal punishments are applied to individuals who are accused of being in the LGBT community in this country. Also, in Saudi Arabia the government as part of a death penalty sentence for different types of crimes, in some instances sanction beheadings of convicted prisoners. Another thing, in Saudi Arabia the people cannot elect the Heads of State because they have a monarchy and power is inherited by bloodlines. In my opinion, United States politicians talk about human rights issues in public forums only regarding countries that they don't have strong financial ties or to get the approval of their citizens if they want to overthrow the government in question. Politicians on one hand say that they care about human rights but on the other hand don't go after dictatorial regimes, like Saudi Arabia, if oil companies that are incorporated in the United States benefit financially from those countries.",

The Democrats tried to kick him out of office by using a Hispanic Mayor in order to appeal to the Hispanics.

During his 2nd term he personally handled the infamous Cerro Grande Fire like a fucking boss and would lead efforts to combat the fire. Once a small fire was starting to make it's way towards someone's house. Johnson ran out of his car with his coat and put that bitch out with his bare hands.\n\nBtw: Under Johnson's leadership there were no tax increases for six years and he managed to cut the size of Government and eliminated the deficit. This guy knows what he's doing.\n\nHe's also a former CEO and an entrepreneur who built his fortune from the ground fucking up.

The US, Australia, Vietnam and Peru joined the negotiations in 2008, Malaysia in 2010, Canada and Mexico in 2012, and Japan in 2013.\nTPP's ambitious goals are to promote trade, investment , economic growth, job creation, development and innovation through the collaboration of the signing countries. Although intitially the goal was to conclude the negotiations in 2012, due to discrepancies in views concerning intellectual property, agriculture and services among others, the talks for the TPP are still ongoing.  However, US PresidentObama has made of the TPP is one of the primary goals of his trade agenda. But it is likely that the next US President will still have to deal with the issues surrounding the implementation of the TPP.\nIts supporters have billed it as a pathway to unlock future growth of the countries involved in the pact.

    "Why doesn't anyone acknowledge the relationship the Bush family has had for decades with the Clinton's and the drugs for guns that they were all part of that was just the tip of the ice berg. FOX news wants to expose the Clinton's and who doesn't, but they want to elevate the Bush's on a pedestal when that whole bloodline is responsible for some of the most devious and atrocious acts of the twentieth and twenty first centuries.",
    "He says she's \"not a leader.\"\u00a0 But then he says she's a \"dictator.\"\u00a0 He contradicts himself. No confirmation for his stories.\u00a0 No one describes her as \"screaming and yelling.\" That's just his claim, not substantiated.",

    "Uniformed agents do not get close enough to witness what happening with first family or have personal contacts with them, This photo what they show him with Clinton is standard photo what every White House employee have, it is part of tradition. Uniformed agents are part of outer perimeter of security bubble around First Family and are posted next to Oval Office only when it is empty. When President enters to Oval Office that post is overtaken by member of Presidential Protective Division (men in suits) and uniformed officers are moved to cover outer perimeter of security bubble. He could not witness things he claims and walk in to Bills alleged adultery or clean up any mess after Bills encounters and even if Hillary gave Bill blue eye I think that dog of a man deserved every punch he got it is miracle that Hillary did not kill that dirty bastard.  This is attack against Hillary as woman to show that you can not trust woman president because of temperament of woman and change of moods typical to woman as they are pictured in mind of every male chauvinist. \n\nWhat this man dose is very serious  crime against Secret Service professional ethics and you can take seriously any statements coming from such tinted source who can just through away all code of professional honour and change it for money and 15 minutes of fame.",
    "There's more in his book. Of course he's not giving it all away, but we've heard enough, and much is online and well known from other agents and people who worked for them both. BASICALLY IT GOES LIKE THIS: FBI QUESTION: \"Where, Mr. & Mrs Clinton, is the missing 5 million?\" CLINTON'S ANSWER:  \"Well, ladies and gents, see, we hired 'Old Mrs. Coots' to put those 5 million in this particular program, but Mrs Coots died of a heart attack. So we have no idea where she put the money. It's just up and disappeared.\" FBI RESPONSE: \"Oh, okay. Guess that closes this investigation.\"",
    "His book is truthful otherwise he would be sued for Public Slander. Someone needs to ask 'Hacked-out-Hilary- why she doesn't sue him if he's lying about her. Instead she just laughs and waves it off. How much more evidence do people need showing how corrupt the Clinton's are?",
    "i would like to see a new law that would prohibit the first lady  or first man from running for the office of president if their partner has served 8 years.  When Bill Clinton ran for president he said that with Hillary around you get two for the price of one.  Everyone knows she ran a lot of the white house presidential duties while Bill chased all the females employed there. Plus with equal rights with the right to vote and hold office for women times today demand this law because of the possibility of serving 12- 16 years as co-presidents is about to occur with Hillary running (again).",

All that matter to them is continuing on the destruction of traditional American culture and replacing it with their grand vision of something non-white, non-male, non-straight, non-christian. And yet, the right is accused of being racist and sexist and against other sex preferences but it's fine for them to hate on whites, men, straights, and Christians.  I honestly don't recognize America anymore after Obamas reign. It's like a nightmare shit hole that's even more divided than it was during the US civil war. He's destroyed tradition and replaced it with toxic diversity. People long to be with their own kind and are more comfortable that way. This doesn't make them racists. It makes them normal. Now we're a society without a culture and a nation without a culture isn't a nation at all.",

I believe that she was angry a lot while the Clintons were in the White House because she had to face the embarrassment of her husband's infidelity especially when they went through the same situation publicly while President Clinton was the governor. Therefore, I don't doubt that she wasn't the kindness person at the White House.  If she was, then they would have been laughing and calling Mrs. Clinton a fool.  She was a human being who needed to vent while she was shedding the tears in the back.",

Results matter.",

I've known a Scorpio with Pisces moon since high school- nearly 50 years. I think not.",

What if he heard top secret information being discussed, would he/she be allowed to go tell whoever they pleased? It makes me wonder. Then again this could just be another kook Hannity found that could further besmirch the character of the Clintons.",

Both of these politicians are corrupt and both care about no one (other than votes) other than themselves. If ppl really think that this country is gonna be better off with  either Clinton or Trump then you're in for a rude awakening. Both of these ppl are crude and cold hearted. Clinton is made up of countless lies and Trump thinks that if \"he\" says what he says he's gonna do then he's gonna do it? Yeah I'll be waiting for this \"wall\" that's gonna protect us for terrorists and immigration problems as well.  Or how he's gonna bring all of these countless jobs back to America from over seas? Seriously ppl actually believe this? Also the U.S. Presidents for the last 15-20 yrs have had a mind like a dictator. Nothing new here with that.",
    "Gee. This was on FOX? The unbiased network? I am truly shocked. Where was he eight years ago, when Hillary was running against Barrack Obama? Why not a book then? Hmmm..... I thought that the secret service was sworn to just that...secrecy. There job is to protect the President and his family and never, ever\u00a0comment on the private lives of the people that they are sworn to protect. I know this because my best friends husband was an FBI agent during the Clinton administration, and was stationed close to the President during that time. I can't get even one iota of \"juice\" from him regarding the Clinton's.P.S.: The questions are so soft ball and biased, with the interviewer stating his own opinion while posing the questions,\u00a0wording the questions to elicit a negative response from the author even before the\u00a0question was posed, and prompting him to comment on the most controversial parts of this book...which I believe to be a total work of fiction.",

He was not ever in the posistion to have seen any one the fallacies he has written.He was the lowest form of Secret Service, he was never, ever near the Clintons, he would be on post doing more like janitorial work.

How can\u00a0you, in good conscience, cast a vote for a candidate that is actively being investigated for corruption while she was\u00a0serving in government? Doesn't that bother you at all? Aren't you fed up with the downward\u00a0direction our nation is heading? How on earth could you vote for more of the same?",
    "This woman has no heart. We lost Americans at Benghazi and she thinks she has the power to tell us to put it behind and move on. The men who died at the embassy were our brothers, husbands and she spoke about moving on as if she has lost a husband or daughter before. The families of these Americans are mourning and all she can say is to move on. Was it her brother that died at Benghazi? She is wicked and not worthy to be our leader. If we have to move on, she is not the one to tell us that because the horrible incident happened under her watch. \n\nLet us not forget that her husband signed the stupid laws that sent US Factories where poor black people work to China as well as the bill that put thousands of blacks to prison but yet these uninformed black people smiles around Clintons as if they have anything good for them.\n\nAt least Donald has created so many jobs in our country for all.

But a simple phone call by the New York Post to the police found out that the real cause of death was a crushed throat, presumably by a barbell he dropped while pumping iron.

But most of all, the last thing we need is a President with an \"above the law\" attitude. \nWhich we know Hillary already has.  \n\nThe emails Hillary sent on an unsecured server that was able to be hacked by a Romanian taxi driver  contained not just information far more secret than anything Bradley/Chelsea Manning exposed and is now serving a 35 year sentence for,  they had \"special compartmented intelligence\" in them.   They could have done an enormous amount of damage to the United States.   See Donald Rumsfeld's interview on this topic.",

It may be so much to the point she just wasn\u2019t cut out for it and it was probably just overwhelming. This is exactly what went through my mind as you were telling your story. Some people just aren\u2019t cut out for a lot of responsibility, especially complex responsibility like helping run a country. I don\u2019t say that what she did was right, it was wrong, and I\u2019m sorry you had to face this. Condolences to the man\u2019s family over the suicide issue though.

    "I am a New Zealander who lives in NZ. I closely follow U.S politics as it has a large bearing on NZ.  NZ prime ministers' will very rarely publicly disagree with a U.S President or fail to support them, especially the current PM. But I have to say that the NZ media depiction and coverage of Trump is an absolute disgrace to the point of serious malpractice. They are intent on portraying him in the worst way possible. Any Trump statement that can be spun to make Trump appear racist, sexist, unstable, cruel, or idiotic will be hungrily snapped up and put out to the public (most of whom do not follow U.S politics very closely at all and have too much trust and faith in media generally). There is an undertone of contempt and disrespect by media commentators on radio and TV towards Trump. In fact it is to such a point that to openly support Trump around family and friends draws scoffs and derisive laughs. If you carry the debate with such people for more than a minute you find that people have almost no basis for these views and end up retreating quickly, often with a \"well I certainly wouldn't vote for him\". On the other hand, I have not heard one single negative thing about Hillary Clinton from the NZ media. She is almost seen as a saint and someone who would make a terrific President.....This imbalance makes me extremely pissed off. A week or so ago on TV1, (NZ's flagship news network) aired, at a very viewable hour, a documentary that can only be described as a hit piece on Trump. It was one hour long and consisted of a series of interviews of people who hated, or had been wronged by, Trump. It went into all his business failures and virtually anything that could be dug up on the man. It did not offer any balance or even anything positive at all. I love my country, but something foul and disgraceful is happening here and I hope that this is acknowledged somehow someway.....I support Ted Cruz btw (since Rand Paul dropped out), but I like Trump and he would be far far better than Hillary who I believe to be a terrible human being, cold hearted, and not fit to manage a cabinet position let alone the executive branch of the nation.",

HELP OUT THE WORKING PEOPLE NOT THE BUMS LOOKING TO SCORE!!!",
    "Actually, if you set up healthcare for all in a smart way, it doesn't have to cost the state anywhere near what America is spending now. America spends a higher proportion of it's budget for healthcare than ANY other industrialized nation, and is the only one of those nations that doesn't cover anywhere near 100%. In some countries, the government-owned healthcare companies are actually profitable whilst providing full unrestricted coverage for all (which is why the governments in those countries sometimes try to tap into the insurance company's cash reserves). People doing regular check-ups don't cost as much to heal as people who show up at the emergency room uninsured with an illness at advanced stages. If that wasn't true, insurance companies wouldn't exist.",

    "Trump is a p*ssy (since he uses that term) for trying to get a widow to move out of her house and have it destroyed because he wanted her space for a parking lot. (Only a BIG P*SSY would use his wealth  and negotiation ability to destroy a person's freedom) Would you do that?  Really?  I'm talking to you who are pumping Trump.  Would you do what Trump did?  Trump even NEGOTIATED with the government in order to use eminent domain against her in destroying her house. Can you believe that?  Really?  I'm sure all Americans aren't that zombified yet.  Americans, stop making excuses for Trump or any other candidate running for president. The system that runs the US government is evil, very evil, and needs to be taken down, yesterday.  I'm talking about a system that brought tons of drugs and guns in Los Angeles and other cities and is still getting away with it.  How many times do you need to be raped before you figure this out? If you still want Trump, is it that you want to be raped a different way or something?  Do you think Trump is going to rape you better? *Trump is to the 'right' as Obama is to the 'left.'* Get it?  *Different Puppet, Same Play!*  Trump isn't going to expose the US government's involvement in 911, though he might say Bush knew, or that Bush flew Saudis out, or something.  If Trump were going to expose anything about 911, he would have exposed it years ago when he had plenty of time and chances to do so, even a T.V. show.  Why would he bait us now? If you elect him, all he is going to do is tell us is what country supposedly \"really\" did it. (sound familiar?) Then soon or later that country will get attacked in the name of War on Terror (the same MO, nothing changes).  Get it?  Don't you get it by now? Now you know why Trump is pumping a bigger and stronger military instead of demanding the repeal of the USA Patriot Act and the NDAA and a whole bunch of other tyrannical measures and laws. The War on Terror is a perpetual war where no enemy is defined, where the citizens are purposely the suspects, and it can last forever if we don't stop it. Get it? Haven't you figured out what's really going on?  Perpetual war with perpetual powers is the name of the game to rule those who dare to believe they are free and have God given rights in a free country. Trump knows how to negotiate alright, but negotiating with the devil's kingdom (politicians and the elite) isn't necessarily a good thing.  The choice of the lesser of two or more evils is not an option! Take down the system and put those in government and those who are elite responsible in prison, yesterday.  America, America, there is enough of you who understand what I'm saying (you know who you are).  Do something before it's too late.  And for lawyers and law enforrcement, what I'm saying is that Americans have a right and duty to abolish any form of government that even resembles what we have today. We the People created the federal and state governments, and We the People have the power and authority to take it out; hence, We the People should never give up the 2nd Amendment or any other right.  In other words, We the People can withdraw our power and consent to be governed anytime we want to, and we don't need a judge or cop to say so, and God in heaven will agree (pastors and ministers, take a hint). We the People started this republic and We the People can fix this republic. We don't need p*ssies like Trump or any other candidate to pretend that they have the real power and authority instead of We the People under God who have no obligations to any corporation even such as the one in D.C. Those who say God doesn't exist or those who worship the devil don't have any claim to or for our republic, for our republic is founded on God, and we have and had acknowledged and stated in its founding that our authority and power come from God (ref: states' and federal's constitution preface/s). Permission is hereby granted to everyone to copy and paste this entire statement/comment but no authorization is granted to anyone to convey this out of context.

    "We should never leave our children a world better than we found it.  We should never leave our children with more money then we started with.  We should never simply hand life over to them.  The result is the spoiled and entitled generation we have to do who knows nothing of sacrifice and patients.  I see it everyday when people get mad because they have to wait behind two people in line at the store.  I see it every day from the idiots who zoom in front of another without a TURN SIGNAL so they can get to the red light quicker.  I see it everyday when you have been standing in line waiting to cash out at the store, and someone walks up right behind you, and another line opens and they are quick to run over first instead of offering it to the person in front of them who has been standing there longer.  I see it when people are in the drive through and they get mad because they have to wait behind two cars.  It is in our nature to only live what we know and what we are taught.  If we hand the next generation a world already provided as it is today, they never learn the value of hard work and sacrifice.  They become spoiled and entitled.  They think the most easy things in life are the hardest.  But they think.....it is someone else job to provide if for them, yet they do not have to provide it back to someone else.  They think of a right only if someone can provide it to them, but think it is someone else job to provide it to another and they do not have to.  That is what we see through this generation and have not had to lift a finger for anyone.  Parents have failed these children, because their parents failed them.  Handing a child everything in life only gives them moments of happiness, but a lifetime attitude of entitlement.  You think by giving everything your child wants as opposed to everything they need makes you a great parent?  No, you have failed.  This is why schools are failing kids trying to paint a picture of a perfect world where everyone holds hands and sings songs.  That person faults are truly not their own and someone should take care of them.  A child has a birth right, and these are few and far.  To a good mother and FATHER, who is envolved with their children, who loves their children, and shows discipline (parents today do to much or not enough)  But I promise you, that if you give your child the right amount of love, and the right amount of discipline, you are teaching your child the most important less of all;  RESPECT.  Something highly missing from this younger generation today.  Each generation must start over and learn the simple values of life.  Father hood, mother hood, love, discipline, respect, morals, values, ethics, and above all: GOD!  Everything material should be earned.  Food, water, clothing should be earned worked for.  People who understand the value of what I am saying know what I am saying.  Children need to earn the simply things in life or they will NEVER earn respect for the basic things in life, and spoiled on the large things in life.  This was the simple message President Bush had towards the next generation.  But we are failing.  The ONLY way we can restore, is to change the entitlement spoiled attitude.  And by doing that, is to get rid of automatic entitlement programs just because a person is poor.  Mandate two years of all out of high school or 18 years of age to serve in the military. Impeach congress and state officials and judges who continually push fathers out of their childs life.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  But money talks and too many people's jobs depend on control and taking the child away.  It truly is sick.  Every generation is entitled to start from the beginning and learn their way.  Not be cradled around like babies when they are 13.  \"oh his just a kid.  Let him be a kid'  Problem with that, is they never grow out of that.  Stop treating kids like babies.  Kids will adapt to anything.  They kids that grow up with emotion problems is because they lack either a father or mother, and lack the foundation of what a child needs: love and discipline.  That is why they do not respect themselves or others!  Living under the same roof does not mean your are parenting your child!",
    "Thank you President Bush for doing what few have the guts to do; serve your country.  Thank you soldiers for being so brave to serve others and protect us.  Without you, we would not be free.  What so many people forget and what SO many take for granted.  I am ashamed that I never served.  That someone else did what my job was to do.  People should be ashamed if they demand freedom but are not willing to fight for it and think it is someone else job to do it.  If you have not served, then you believe it IS someone else job to fight for it.  And for that, you have no right to claim freedom as your right.  You should be so lucky to claim freedom as a privilege!",

W. Bush was gifted one of the most captivating and divinely glorious deliveries by way of his loving son, George W. Bush. No politicization. This was a preponderant event of truthfulness: it was the sincerest of transparent love illustrated by a son celebrating his father's life and ascension into heaven, and George W. Bush adjusting to this worldly life devoid of his father's physical presence, yet in prayer and strong faith, all will be united owing to God's grace, mercy and Eternal Love.\nEnjoy heaven, George H. W. Bush - and I am sure you enjoyed the amazingly stunning celebratory funeral that rendered politics smaller than an incredibly honourable life that you fulfilled, and guided and inevitably taught your family with divine strength, character, and wisdom: and above everything, unconditional supportive love.\nThank you and God bless you, George W.

Certainly nothing like the meeting Bill and Loretta had on the tarmac which was actually illegal and the media said otherwise. and he may or may not have cheated on his wife. Neither one is illegal. Remember they didn't impeach Clinton for cheating but lying under oath. His approval rating was never higher than during the Monica Lewinsky debacle. Bill Clinton didn't have to testify and could have just took the fifth. He figures it's his word against hers. Who would have ever thought someone would keep a c.m stained dress.

No one wanted to f..k Carter or Reagan and they were so old they probably couldn't find it. Obama seemed to be more worried about transgender women than biological.

    "Fox is a part of the machine working against the people, so is Trump, so is MSNBC, so is CNN all this is a smoke screen to keep us talking and gawking while they are behind the scenes peeling away the layers of civility and the safety's our constitution provides us. Like seriously, if any other president did half of what Trump's done in \"plain sight\" (quoting Orwell) . They would've been removed from office, he uses fear to rally those who believes he's their Savior, CNN and MSNBC in turn spread the fear by making you feel the urgency in the danger he poses by sharing \"facts\" with you that clearly everyone can see but ignore which makes those on the Left feel like Trump's gotta go and we focus on him and his constituates. While Fox and Alex Jones feed the conspiracies he panders or vice versa  by feeding the idea that there are secret fact that they know for a fact are true but can't show you because the deep state is hiding them (I actually believe Trump's a pawn or decoy, which is why him being removed from office is less likely to happen as this thing contributes to grow) and those on the right grow in fear that everything they love is on the line if Trump's not there to protect them. Eventually there's a major shift or a divide (a breaking point) and everyone is forced to pick a side enemy or friend. There will be no middle ground, the middle ground will be the battle ground. Don't be fooled, everything on both sides is pure propaganda.. it's a good movie that's hard to turn away from but it was made that way by design whether it be Fox, CNN, campaign rally, Alex Jones, news paper, YouTube, podcast or radio the fact is that technology has been weaponized against the American people. Technology has made it so that every seat is a good seat once you've bought your ticket (bought into the propaganda), and popcorn, and soda and candy they roll the footage and you choose what you want to see so it's always the best thing for you in your mind so instead of seeing the smoke screen they are throwing up you ignore everything else around you and lock in all the while ignoring the smell of smoke while the theater's burning to the ground.. most people won't know the buildings on fire until the flames are touching the cuff of their pants and by then it'll be too late.

He is riling up his base and actively asking these people to resort to violence with words like \"get to the voting places and keep a close eye\" and \"although the second amendment people, I don't know, maybe there is something you can do about this, I don't know\"....... I am terrified of going to vote now because I am afraid of some gun-toting moron just opening fire on random people he *thinks* are Hillary supporters. And why is he going on and on and on about this election rigging and now ridiculously blaming Hitlary (for all the bad she is) to have been the one behind the NC firebombing? Condemn it on twitter or any other media outlet, but stop fanning the flames of violence. All because he is now facing a reality that for the first time in his life, he is going to have to go in front of millions of people and admit he lost? Are you frickin kidding me Chris? Ugh.",

    "The U.S. government has passed loopholes called foundations where rich people can hide their money from being taxed and use those foundations to gain more wealth than ever before. Why do you think men like Bill Gates put all their money into the foundation that can be used to buy out other companies to make more money. Bill Gates, the Clinton's and any other rich person who sets up a foundation knows it's a tax loophole that only the rich get to enjoy the benefits from. \n\nSome of these foundations are used to help the poor but only to make it appear that the rich people care about the poor while growing their wealth. This kind of corruption is the worst kind there is. Making the appearance of caring for the poor. it's very similar to how the Roman Catholic Church was set up and the governing power of the Vatican. They get all their false gods built with human hands and collect money from those slaves to enrich themselves. They use some of that money to help the poorest of the poor to make it look like they care about the poor.   LOL !!!!!!",
    "Thanks Howard. So the Clinton Foundation does do good work, according to you. And it was Bill Clinton's advisers asking for high appearance fees, not Bill. And it was Chelsea Clinton who asked for a review. Sounds like corporate governance  that a lot of our American corporations could emulate. That way we wouldn't have a greedy prick at Goldman Sachs getting paid $ 128 million a year one year after his bank was bailed out by our tax money. . Maybe that would have prevented the two arseholes at Well Fargo who fired 3,500 people for pepetuating a fraud that the execs had ordered, and who were then paid out $ 320 M between the two of them.

Fight tooth & nail, don't budge on anything no matter how small because if you give them an inch they will take a mile!\n\nThe proposed ban won't make anyone safer for the following reasons:\n\nYou can train your trigger finger to have more speed & endurance & train ambi-so that when you do eventually fatigue your trigger finger you swap arms & can even train your middle finger to use as fast pull trigger fingers.\n\nThis is more than half way to bump stock av-speeds, you can even mod these triggers yourself to pull so easily that gun smiths wouldn't even go there due to liability concerns for safety so with a 1/2 lb, 1 stage short stroke trigger your basically at max 450rpm with a trained trigger finger.\n\nYou can't ban fingers or triggers & don't listen to the lies claiming Stephen Paddocks bump stocks were spitting out 800rpm...lies!  \n\nThey are not accounting for reload time (this is known as actual rate of fire, NOT rate of fire) as you can't get a 800rnd mag unless a belt-fed & I've done the math & analysed the bursts he fired around 800-850rnds, he was averaging approx. 540rpm on continuous steady bursts. \n\nIf you account for with breaks in between & inconsistencies with the bump stocks, he only fired 96 seconds out of 524/8mins 44secs so was only averaging approx. 91.6rpm which is an easily beatable actual rate of fire with a factory semi-auto, easily blown out of the water with a hair trigger!\n\nThe mainstream media won't tell you this because it would also blow their plan to ban bump stocks right out of the water!",

We had no fit running person for Democrat this time and Trump is making our economy much better, which is needed more than anything.  Thank God he still loves America and not ashamed of it.  I am ashamed of the Democratic party acting like spoiled children.  Let the man have his 4 years and then maybe dems will be in again .  This is the fair way.  These dems today are not the dems in the past. Dems in the past had more class than this and smarter as well .  We had some good dems in the past but have not really had good candidate lately.  Dems have never protested and acted  like these people today.  Don't we all want America to stay great.  My choice for President did not always win but I never talked about the one that won because the majority of the people's choice won.  That is how America runs elections.

    "They can't be hacked because the voting machines are not online. The Russians would need personal access to each voting machine to rig anything. However, we do know many machines were flipping Trump votes to Hillary votes. So if anything Trump has a lot more votes than what is reported and a recount would only favor Trump and could put him over the top with the popular vote. Also, something is very wrong with the California votes. There should easily be over 5 million votes for Trump, yet they show under 4 million votes. Trump has the most votes in history by any republican in a general election. Bush had the record in 2004. Trump beat Bush, McCain and Romney, and all three of them have a lot more votes in California than Trump has. That means there is a major problem with the California vote count. It is also now confirmed over 3 million illegal votes were cast by illegals which are all likely votes cast for Hillary. So Hillary has not actually won the popular vote. Trump won it by more than a million votes after removing the 3 million illegal votes and from all the States that reported voting machines flipping Trump votes to Hillary votes, there is likely millions of votes that went to Hillary that should have went for Trump. So if you want a recount I want it for all the States so Trump gets the millions of votes he was robbed of.",

This is now a known fact, the Russia story was a full on plant job that the MSM eagerly ate up and then fed the BS to it's listeners to the point the left leaning MSM can no longer be trusted to tell the truth as for Feinstein she should be recused from all committees she currently sits on and then ousted by the Senate for allowing a foreign spy into her world inside DC. Her complaints with the SCOTUS hearings are that she can't get a diaper change when she needs it, who in their right mind thinks that a 85 year old woman has any business at all holding down a seat in the US Senate, we need term limits and she is the poster child for that change. Democrats have shown just how childish and ignorant they are in these hearings, shouting at the top of their lungs within the hearing chambers is what that party has become, a group of morons that show on a daily basis they have no business being in DC, they ignore the plight of their constituents and spout anything that will get their fugly mugs on their liberal controlled MSM. They are no longer a valid party, they have included those who hate the USA, they have embraced socialism and strayed way to far to the left so much so that they now openly support hate groups and gangs. The Democrats should be held accountable for the lawlessness of the Obama administration, the double standard in DC needs to end now, all those who have committed crimes no matter the positions they have held in our government need to be investigated, indicted and then jailed for their acts of treason.

Then, to make matters worse, she attempts to cover up the incident! \n\nAs to the sealed documents on Kavanaugh that the Dems are losing their frick'n minds over, they have yet to approve the release of the un-redacted FISA Warrants that began this 2-year farce of an investigation of Trump's 'alleged' collusion with Russia.

They're notorious for their stall tactics and their obvious goal is to prolong this until AFTER the Mid-term Elections in November.\n\nIt's time for these Republican Senators to follow President Trump's lead, put away their Kid gloves and trade blow for blow with these lying Democratic weasels on the Left!",

    "Senator Feinstein had the PRC's Communist spy working in her close employ for 10 years, and when it was revealed, did not care about the breaches (which probably included leaks over sensitive issues such as the disaster of an Iran deal, Hillary's server and the rest of it).  And after a series of insulting outbursts that violated Senate Rules wanted to talk about how reasonable her colleagues are?  Sen. Feinstein just said that her colleagues did not do what they did.  This is for openers.  It gets worse.  Maybe Trump should have picked the candidate who was \"too Catholic\" (was that a paraphrase or a quote?); Sen. Feinstein's considered reasonableness in trashing even the First Amendment, albeit in doddering Senatorial style, would be even more comical than handing all Committee members over 400,000 pages of documents, and then having the illiterate claim they needed more paperwork.  Anyone see the Marxist pattern here?  Goal-oriented nuance stripping.\n\nIn fact, if one considers reality here, Sen. Grassley deserves the praise for blocking adding yet another Marxist Apologist, if not a card-carrying Marxist like former CIA Director Brennan, being added to an already almost half-Marxist Supreme Court.  There are boxwoods all around the Supreme Court....  And they stink.  I noticed them when I first got to DC a year ago Thursday.",
    "Leave it to Feinstein to state the obvious reason for the Democrats lack of cooperation with \u201cthe process\u201d.

    "What a great experiment to test the patriotic pulse of the nation. There are better ways to get attention to your cause besides disrespecting your country. What next? It's your right to burn the flag too. That will get some attention for your cause. Why stop here? Go all the way. Find out how far we really have fallen. This is not only sad for the NFL, it is sad for a nation if we sit idly by as a nation and don't boycott the NFL and their supporting sponsors. When you protest during an anthem where soldiers are standing and saluting. You are telling the world that you no longer believe in your country. It's a dangerous experiment.",

No more tax dollars for the Not for America Football League, please don't waste our tax dollars on these spoiled un-american millionaires.  Spend that money on our Veterans instead.  Maybe their should be a Military Football League after college.  I would rather watch Veterans play than the NFL anyway.",
    "If a player publicly talks about the league or an official, he's fined. If they disrespect the fans, the flag, or the country and those who defend it, Goodell encourages it. Tebow was berated by the league for praying, if he snubbed the anthem, the league would defend him. If it's NOT about the military, as they \"claim\", then protest AFTER the game. Meet in an end zone, lock arms and legs, kneel or whatever and protest !. But they want to FORCE fans to \"watch\" their antics DURING the anthem. Why ? Because it's NOT about an \"issue\", social, race, Trump, or anything else. It's about distracting from the one thing that has everyone's attention - the ANTHEM and turning that attention to THEM ! They don't care if the fans like it or not and they don't care how it makes the soldiers on the field and watching from Afghanistan feel. Delanie Walker (Titans) made that clear. But the fans have had enough and are siding with the country and the soldiers, not the players. Can't fix it now !",

I didn't vote trump nor hillary i thought they were bad candidates. But respect what trump said to the NFL. Trump 2020. We immigrated this country years ago to escape europe's bullshit rules in the 1400s. We are proud to be here united as a great nation. America isn't superior yet we have freedoms here. Freedom isn't free. Respect is earned from the hard work that is done and all. There's no peace without conflict and there's no love without hate. All we do is try until the very end. I love to call America my home because i was born and raised here as a proud american. Life is hell but America always have my back when needed. Fuck the NFL and social justice. Praise America for all our founding fathers of this proud nation has done to get us this far. No one said shit about antifa burning American flags yet they said something about the NFL. Fuck NFL and ESPN.",

Therefore, my entire family will boycott the NFL this year. \nTake a knee, sit on the bench, I don't care. Either way, you're being hugely disrespectful to all of the veterans, past, present, and future who have written a check to be cashed in for the ultimate sacrifice of their lives so you would possess such civil rights non-existent in other countries around the world.

I'm certain NBC, CBS, and Fox are going to see a significant drop in viewership.The NFL is going to see a big decrease in sales of NFL apparel too. I urge everyone to stop supporting the NFL. Life is good without football. Go President Trump !!!",

I put up with the thugs and their antics, but now they are trying to tear apart the flag, and everything for which it stands, at its seams. This will be Obama's legacy. This is what he wanted and fostered. Just read materials from his time as a citizen before his Presidency and you will see...unless you are blind.

Do they mean by Black Lives Matters standards?  You know, like in Baltimore when the looting (early Christmas shopping) and rioting started before anyone even realized that 3 of the cops were black (much less the facts)?  Or better yet, in Charlotte where a 'black' suspect who won't drop his weapon is shot by a 'black' cop who works for a 'black' police chief who works for a 'black' mayor naturally led to race riots with looting, destruction of property and beating up of whites?  That was special (MLK would have been truly ashamed).\n\nBut that's what happens when you always assume that if something bad happens to a black suspect that there 'must' be wrong-doing, not to mention it 'must' have been racially motivated (that means police vs 'citizen' becomes null and void and blacks have to be treated special?).\n\nThe sad part is that in all these BLM highly publicized cases, that had the suspects been other than black, the stories would have never even made it past their local news!!!\n\nNo wonder all these puppets buy into the notion that cops are somehow targeting blacks disproportionately (which seems to be the driving force behind this nonsense).  Unfortunately for them the facts say otherwise (remember all police involved shootings are a matter of public record), and why BLM always avoids the subject or hems, hahs and stutters when it's brought to their attention.  Why let facts get in the way if they don't fit your agenda, right?\n\nAnd has anyone noticed that BLM hasn't even found a reason to misbehave for over a year now (Charlotte, with a change in the White House since) even by BLM's 'lofty' standards?  So what's the beef?\n\nIs it the oppression?  We are talking about this millennium right?  Never mind we had a two term black president (how's that for oppressed?), or maybe too little impact on our culture?  Perhaps not enough black millionaires nowadays (or successful blacks) or enough special privileges or special rights?  And what about the double standards like how come it's OK for affirmative action (race based favoritism), black college funds (ditto), black colleges (ditto), association for the 'advancement' of blacks (NAACP - just imagine the furor over a NAAWP), black advocacy (ditto),  black this and black that (the list goes on and on and on) ... but yet somehow if you replace 'black' with 'white' would be considered prejudiced, racist and supremacist?  It does make a good point though for 'racial inequality'?\n\nSo why embarrass themselves like that (or the game of football)?  And the last time I checked, pissing people off isn't exactly the way to get what you want - whatever the hell that is (a higher pedestal?).  This is horseshit.\n\nYOU'RE FIRED!",

Also, many don't have legs to stand or a hand to place over their heart.\n\n\nEveryone should respect their freedoms, their country and the American Flag, many gave all for.\n\nMy husband was one of those soldiers. I have his flag, from his coffin, where I kiss it every day.  Yes, there are some people more patriotic than others, but when I hear the National Anthem play and see the American Flag waving in the wind, I pray that God brings the other men home safely.\n\n\nSome have it all and that gives them the right to ignore what is so very sacred and heartwarming to others.  That is their choice.  My husband did not have a husband choice.\n\nSo the next time you choose to show disrespect, please think of the grieving Mothers, Fathers, Husbands,   Wives and children who will never have another chance to stand proudly with their loved one and rejoice with them.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

'Boycott' is a loaded term, but while a die hard fan might not be willing to say they are going to 'boycott' their team, that doesn't mean they are going to tune in when other games are happening (there go the ratings even further), and while they might have unreservedly bought the new merchandise or memorabilia before, they might not be so quick to hand over their money if they think the game is tainted by politics. Also, the fact pre-Trump or pre-Kaepernick is that the NFL lost a lot of fans in the 1990s when they started moving teams to different cities for newer stadiums, when the teams sold blocks of quality seats to corporations and made fans pay $50 for nosebleed seats, and so forth.

Look how she hasn't given a press conference in over 200 days. She is a puppet of the elite class; the controllers. Hillary Clinton does not love America. She loves power.",

I was under the impression the Alt-Right\ncomprised of all races, men and women, straight and gay - everyone - from Youtubers to guys like Milo, people who speak out against censorship, political correctness, 3rd wave feminism, hate groups, cop bashing, illegal immigration, statistic manipulation and media lies and misinformation . . .\n\nBut liberal publications and sites on the left, like the New York Times, Rolling Stone and the Democratic party claim the alt-right is just a bunch of white racists . . .\n\nAm I misinterpreting what the Alt-Right is or is the left trying to smear the Alt-Right and shout \"racism\" instead of actually addressing the movement (I honestly don't know which is true) \n\nTo me it seems like the left - Hillary and the Democrats - are trying to cling on to a lot of the tech-savvy youth and minority votes by labeling people who oppose media  bias, and corruption within the establishment as just being white and racist . . . \n\nI mean, that's my interpretation, am I wrong?

What I do believe is happening though has nothing to do with Clinton. It's Johnson eating into Trumps voter base as it numbers are very slowly but consistently moving up.

No lights, no hospitals, no police (BLM will LOVE this), no water, no sewers, no food, no cell phone, no tv, no radios, no internet.  Why, because the actions of Barack Osama and Hillary Clinton have ruined the the Russian economy by at least 50% since 2011 and has pissed Putin off, when instead they should have linked up with Russia to wipe out the radical Islamists.

Turned out that Enron had been a scam.  Hillary seems to be the most absentee candidate in any election in U.S. history.

    "Very long story but please bear with me. I would always wonder back and forth as a kid growing up if heaven/hell or if God, Jesus, or angels were real. As a disclaimer I am in a much better state of mind and life currently, but when I was about 25-26 years old I was in a pretty dark point in my life. I had a job I hated where I got treated terribly, no college degree, had just gotten dumped by my girlfriend and felt really alone with no support suffering in silence from depression and feelings of despair inside. I felt worthless and like my life had no purpose. I was down the beach for a long weekend during the summer with my mom and her husband at their beach house and was planning on committing suicide when I got home from the beach. As I was walking the street towards home by myself and fighting back tears in my eyes, suddenly out of nowhere two men appeared and just started to converse with me randomly. I had just taken a good look at the street seconds before I and nobody had been there. One looked like an older gentleman in his early 50\u2019s who said his name was George and the other looked to be maybe early 30\u2019s who\u2019s name was Michael. Both of them had the most piercing blue eyes I had ever seen. I wasn\u2019t afraid and felt a sense of extreme calm, warmth, and relief as they walked with and talked to me. They could tell something was wrong and I told them how I was feeling but never about that I was going to take my life. I told them I really wanted to go back to school and make something of myself but was just feeling awful in life and that I had no purpose. I felt like somehow they could sense or tell that I was planning on ending my life. It seemed like a blur after that but they got a cab and took me for a ride around and just talked to me and said I had such a big heart and encouraged me to follow my dreams and go back to school and make something of myself. After we talked for a bit I told them where I was staying and the cab took me there and they said don\u2019t worry about the bill and that they had it covered. Then I was asleep in my bed before I knew it. Today I am now a Registered Nurse working my way towards becoming a Nurse Practitioner trying to help others which I always enjoyed doing. I also have a beautiful and loving girlfriend who is highly supportive of my goals. I believe these two men weren\u2019t really men at all but were angels that were sent by God/Jesus to save my life that night and stop me from doing something terrible to myself that couldn\u2019t be undone. I still think about it to this day.",

    "I had a flash of being in a car accident twice in one day. When i say \"flash\" i mean, it was like i was there. I felt the impact, heard the metal grinding. My arms were above my head on the roof & i could see my red sleeves. This EXACT instance i saw TWICE. I had never felt or saw anything like that before & i told my mother about it, but i convinced myself it was just anxiety, or stress. Two days later my Dad & i were going to do some Christmas shopping & hit black ice. It spun us around sliding us into a guardrail, and we then rolled over it. As we started to roll over the rail, i had the flash again. It was the EXACT moment of the flash i saw before. The only difference was my arms werent on the roof. So i trusted it. Idk why, but i put my arms up on the roof, saw my red sleeves, & a split second later we hit the gound on my side with such force that had i not been able to push against the roof, i would have broken my neck. We rolled 2 more times & i kept my arms on the roof & by the time we stopped, (upside down), i was completely sideways with the roof on my side flattened all the way to the bottom of the window frame. There was about 6 inches of space between the roof & the bottom of the seat. The dimensions of the space i was in would blow your mind. The drivers side where my dad was didnt take as much damage, but it was like he was in a bubble the way the metal was bent around him. Neither one of us had a scratch on us. All the first responders were in shock that we were fine. When my mom got there she was white as a ghost. She said \"thats what you saw wasnt it?\" all i could do was nod. The tower said she'd never seen a vehicle look like that & the people survived it. Much less, not be in the hospital, in 30 years. \nIve always been a Christian & if you'd asked me before, i would have said that of course angels existed. But, i never really understood. Now, i know that there is a greater power watching over us, & ill never doubt again.\nGod bless",

    "but be careful because sometimes can be the bad spirit, I also believe in angels that they appear but in the Bible says that we need to be looking because is going to happen things around us, bad and good things that we never see before, so we have to be careful with what we see, because sometimes those angels are telling us to be careful because something is going to happen, or sometimes they are protecting us, my mom when she was young, she told she was getting back to home from work and she was walking by herself, she saw one boy coming, she said they was around 12 or 14 years old and she was like 17 years old, the boy walked so fast to catch my mom and go with her, so she said they boy was so quiet, that he doesn't speak at all because she said that she told the boy to let her alone and do not go with me, so she said the boy don't listen and he kept walking with her, then she get into one place that was some persons and she said she saw the boy go into one place that was so hide and a little dark and later disappear, but the most weird thing for her was, why the boy didn't talk to her when she told him go away, and she also ask him his name but he didn't he say nothing, and also the most weird is that when she was walking he walks at the same time, because if she stops he also do the same thing, and told me she don't know if he was real or something else and I told her if said a pray and she the only thing she say is that God help that person to find peace because she doesn't know why that boy appear to her just like that without saying nothing, that's why we have to be careful with what we see, if we see something like this in the video, we can pray to God and say that He help us because we don't know what we are looking and also we don't know why that angel appear to us, and also we need to tell him if that angel come from God let him appear but if don't tell God to make him go because it can be a bad spirit",
    "This is a lying evil pastor..if people only read thier bible they would see the truth..the book of Thessalonians tells you that those who go to heaven DO NOT RETURN .to the earth.they are forever be the lord..why would someone go to heaven a place of bliss then come back to this corrupt earth ? Such a damm liar",
    "I'm a Bible believing Christian, and scripture does tell us we have guardian angels. However, scriptures also warn us that satan can appear as an angel of light, and that we must be very careful about what we see and believe.\n\nIn this case it's obviously a moth right in front of the camera, and part of the illusion is from the barn's tin roof which they didn't actually claim was a sword, but some here mentioned it looked like a sword.\n\nOptical illusion here folks, not an angel.\n\nJack - Canada",
    "Uhm... If that was in fact an Angel, He or She must be called an Archangel. Cos Seraphims and Cherubs don't carry swords. Just saying. Atheist her btw, I just happen to have graduated from a Cathiolic school and it's what I remember about  the hierarchy of angels and stuff... \ud83d\ude0a",

I was Wide awake, completely straight (absolutely No drugs or even a drink!).  As matter of fact it was about One week after my father had passed.  I was sitting and watching over My mother as She was asleep, and bec I was worried about her.  I Do remember saying in my own mind as I watched her, \"help me, help us get through this!\"    I also said the Our Father prayer right after.  It was Immediately after that, that I happened to look up and (very clearly) saw Not one, but Three very Strong, yet Very protective Angels Sitting on my Mom's bed.  As taken back (to put it mildly) as I was, I remember Never feeling 'that' Safe in my Lifetime.  And, they had No wings.  I remember that nite feeling so safe that I almost cld have gone to bed with the doors Open that nite.  I will Never, Not ever forget it.

If you use your words to curse, then guess who comes to collect the weapon you've formed with your mouth?  SATAN.  Speak life, not curses, brothers and sisters and receive Jesus Christ because at the moment you die the one that owns you WILL COME FOR YOU.  Freaky stuff if you don't have Jesus as your Protector.

Division is at an all time high, and if Christ were to show us truth we would hate it, cause he already proved it. The Bible says men loved darkness more than light cause there deeds were evil. This coming from a born again Spirit filled man whom Jesus has saved. Seeing that supposedly angel didn\u2019t make nobody wanna get right.

    "I skeptically watched this video actually kinda hoping that someone possibly caught convincing video evidence of some amazing, spiritually-enlightening being that would blow me away.  But low and behold, once I actually got a good look at the couple snapshots of the supposed \"angel\", all I see is a close-up shot of a white moth flying in front of a motion activated camera. In the second pic you can tell that the \"sword\" is actually just light reflecting off the roof of that building behind the moth. Although I should have known it was BS considering it was aired on the preferred network of the biggest BSer in our country today! I'm still waiting for Trump's tweet taking all the credit for the \"angel's\" visit since they just wanted to see firsthand how much he is \"making America great again\"!",

Yet I do not think what we saw on the picture was an angel, rather I agree with Alex Garton below that it might have been a moth close to the lens or maybe a cloud. Most of all, I would argue that angels who appeared have purpose for doing so, why would an angel want to get caught on a security footage? I see no purpose in its appearance. Instead of running straight to a delusional pastor and ask for his \"expert\" opinion, maybe they should have consulted some fotography experts first, ask how high above the sea level this shoot was taken, excluded the possibility of a moth, a low flying cloud and so forth.",

Then Elijah...calm as he can be...i can hear him now...(Calm yourself bro...Gods got this covered!)  He prays to God, \"Open his eyes that he may see\"  that meaning the spiritual realm.

    "it is a moth or similar insect. Because it is so close, it is out of focus. Its wings flaps faster that the shutter speed so their details are lost. if the camera speed were faster than 60 fps , more detail would be visible. I have seen a few similar videos before. Because people don't understand the physics of it, and are superstitious, they believe they are seeing angels.",

With people such as this, I would suspect that it might be a sign of their total and irrevocable mental breakdown.",

At that moment I also know He was preparing me that someone there was going 'home' soon. And someone did.  Her name was Michelle.

    "First impression is that it's a moth attracted to the light that is illuminating the scene. Because it is in flight and a camera shutter stays open for a certain period of time (maybe 1/30 of a second or longer in low light) the moving object will be motion blurred and seem transparent. I do believe in angels but don't think this is it. If you are looking for proof of something spiritual, you might not understand what \"faith\" actually means.",

    "It is true, the \u201cangelic\u201d walk among us- but it is said that the life of an incarnating angel is never easy, as it is not a natural state for such beings so to encounter one is special, they feel all the world\u2019s suffering as if it were they who were directly affected and cannot bare to see others in pain! They feel this way towards all of Creation, they are the direct \u201coffspring\u201d of the Divine Union, the Trinity is in reality, The Father/The Mother/The Child- All manner of Light Being brought out by the Divine Union that is Consciousness,and learns via experiences, which by the way can occur simultaneously with in one Soul, meaning one soul can incarnate into several existences at once, and at highest soul level one is aware but depending on where in a souls journey one is, you may or may not be aware of this but anyway it\u2019s enough to know that the Divine Masculine and yes, the Divine Feminine, our Divine Creator is the unity of These Two Prime Creator Frequencies, so when we refer to \u201cGod\u201d, we best be referring to this Being of Unity, otherwise we are not perceiving our Creator optimally, This understanding comes, as souls expand and learn via perception and awareness while letting the preconceived notions placed upon humankind by those who are deceivers or imposters, or just plain misled, fall away from interpretation. Btw, balance is very important to ones ultimate being, that said, One of the greatest problems humankind faces in this realm is a great imbalance where the Divine feminine is concerned and there must be balance for souls to properly expand and that balance has been tampered with,  but the good news is there are many souls who have reached exceptional awareness who are here specifically to restore the balance to his original form and repairing the damage caused by disgruntled envious beings who allow their egos to lead them instead of their hearts!",
    "This has got to be the most retarded thing yet! I am a Christian, and for you out there who have never read the Bible, angels do not have wings. Cherubims have wings. Second, the wings of a cherubim have to be huge to support it's weight. The wings of that moth right there are proportional to it's weight and body size. This is so stupid. Yes, I believe in angels and cheribums. Is that a cherubim? I would have to be a moron to believe an cheribum from God is attracted to a street pole light like a moth.",

    "I have seen Lord Jesus too, I met Him twice. First time that He revealed Himself to me He didn't say a word to me but reached out His hand to me which was holding a book.  And when I came closer to see the book which He was giving to me i saw there were words written on it that read  \"THE HOLY BIBLE\"  the word looked golden and do sparkly. The second time that I saw Jesus again was when I was brought before Him and I was on chains filled with shame and fear, I was  so scared and crying terribly because I knew I was not in right with Him yet He alone was the only one who has Authority to decide what to do with me.The chains on me were so heavy that i couldn't stand or walk and as I went crowling before Him I saw tears from my eyes dripping on His feet . I had no courage to lift up my eyes and look Him in His face bse i was feeling ashamed and I knew He was not happy with me. At that moment Jesus spoke to me and told me \" I AM GIVING YOU A CHANCE,  GO BACK AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT\". Now anyone who thinks God is just a myth and doesn't exist is living in darkness please come out of your ignorance and start a new relationship with God your creator.  Yes i have seen Jesus,whether no one believes me i know what i saw and what I felt and what I heard. Truth remains truth.",

    "I sent this story to a friend and then I began to read the comments. I wanted to reply but, I said to myself, what can I really add to this? After reading several comments, I concluded that people either believe or they don't. The Lord gave us his revelation in the last book of the Bible and many stories are recorded about him. Jesus was not a fake or some made up character, he was a real person. Read your history. He was crucified, buried and rose on the 3rd day. It is well documented. He is the only begotten son of God, the Creator of all things. Even the Roman soldier who pierced his side said truly he is the son of God. The religious leaders in his time didn't believe that he was the Messiah because what He taught was a threat to their way of life. They were all powerful and made many new laws for the people to follow in addition to the laws God gave to Moses. People haven't changed. You are a believer or a doubter. Jesus said that we can't love, for example, money and God. We will love one and hate the other. It is written, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into Heaven. The rich and haughty, prideful people can't quite acknowledge that God has helped them achieve what they have achieved. They want to believe they have done it all on their own. They just have their eyes and ears closed. My prayer is that one day the Holy Spirit will wake them up because you don't want to be without Christ when he returns to take His rightful place in this world. I am planting seeds right now. Right now, wickedness is everywhere and the wicked are in control of so much in this world. I wish I could answer why God allows bad things to happen to good people but, I really don't have that knowledge. God is good all the time. God is light and in Him is no darkness. He sent His son to suffer and die so that all who believe in Him will be forgiven if they confess and change. Yes, Jesus died for you. But, when Jesus returns, He will return as a mighty warrior with all of Heaven's army with him; and all the wicked people will run and try to hide from his judgement but, they will not escape the coming judgement. His wisdom is very simple, not complicated. The Bible also tells us that in the end times (where we are now even though we don't know when the last day on this earth will be) there will be false teachers. There are plenty of them here now. Jesus used to say, those who have ears to hear, let them hear and those who have eyes to see, let them see. I feel like a preacher but, I am not. I am a disciple of Christ trying to do what He told us to do. To tell the lost about Him; that He is the good shepherd and that His children know His voice and follow Him. So many of the people commenting on this story appear to have it all figured out and they probably will comment that I am just a kook, crazy, or use foul language. I really don't care what is said after I post this because I am not looking for approval from anyone other than God. No one else's opinion matters. Jesus wants a real relationship with you. He wants us to pray to Him and talk to Him about what is going on with us. For the generation of social media users, I believe this is especially hard. From what I see, people text but don't speak to each other face to face. It is harder to be mean face to face than it is when you write/text mean, hurtful words. Just because you don't understand something, don't give up. Read the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John if you really want to know who Jesus is. He was a radical in His day who said love those who hate you. If you only love those who agree with you, you are no different than they are. Anyone can love someone who is the same as they are. He said God sends the rain to the good and the wicked. The days are short and we don't know when we might die. I pray for you that you get saved and get to know who Jesus really is before it is too late. P.S. I don't know if this is angel or not. I think it is though. And if it is, it encourages me that maybe I will see a real angel of God one day too because they definitely exist.",

Now who is telling the truth Jesus or this jack of a Pastor.....",
    "God is Holy and perfectly righteous and He hates all unrighteousness. We are all transgressors of God's Law, which means we are all sinners, and that is why the Lord Jesus Christ had to suffer, bleed, die and rise again for the justification of His people. Scripture tells that there are none good and no-one seeks God (not the true God of Scripture), that our hearts are deceitful above all things and desperately wicked and that we must be born again, which means to be given a spiritual resurrection. Jesus said we must repent (turn from our love of sin) and believe the Gospel. There are many today who think they are saved, but they never truly repented, but have made a god in their own image. They are either working their way to heaven (we are not saved by works), or they live however they like, using grace as a freedom to sin. True born again children of God are not perfect in this life, but we have these things in common... we strive to live holy, godly lives for God's glory, we hate sin, and we mortify the deeds of the body daily. We want to obey and keep Christ's commandments, not to save us, but because the Holy Spirit has changed our hearts of stone into hearts of flesh, and given us a love for our Lord and Saviour which makes us want to honour and obey Him. When Jesus saves, He doesn't do half a job, He saves to the uttermost and God works in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure. Jesus saves and Jesus keeps us saved, He will lose none of us. So the question is, do you want to saved from hell only, or from your sins, for God's glory? Please read Romans 8:1-14 and the book of first John. They will tell you what a child of God looks like. But remember, in case you are tempted to add self-righteous works to the finished work of Christ, they are filthy rags to God and will not be accepted. Yes, we have works (faith without works is dead), but they are ordained by God for us to walk in, they have no bearing on our standing before the Most High. It is Christ's shed blood and His rising from the dead the third day which justifies His people.",

I have always been a believer in God and his miracles but never thought I would experience the things that happened that week while my Brother was dying. Long story short every prayer I prayed was answered that week including my Brother waking up only an hour after the doctors told us we needed to take him off life support. Praise God! If you don't believe ask God to show you proof and he will. I am changed forever by my experience and I pray you all one day get to witness for yourself that God, Jesus, angels and heaven do exist, they are as real as you are. God bless! \u2764",

To me, it looks like a moth caught mid-flight (blurring and faint because of the low light and it's proximity to the lens). The sword looking thing is significantly clearer and crisper than the \"angel\" which points to it being the roofline of the house/building in the background. Video evidence is not going to convince people to put their trust in Jesus who died to save their sins and rose from the dead. If they don't believe what the scripture says, they definitely not going to believe even if they see a miracle (look up Jesus' parable of Lazarus and the rich man).

    "I can tell you for sure this was a \"Destroying Angel\". He had a sword in his hand because he was there to bring judgment on someone. He purposely triggered the alarm so they could see him. I had a similar experience in which, God Yahweh had told me to go and tell a certain pastor to recognize the true Sabbath (Saturday not Sunday). I hesitated for a while, until I saw this same angel with a sword in his hand over the home of the pastor, several times. So I got up the courage to tell him one day. He and his wife, who was 7 or 8 months pregnant were standing outside. His wife, as she is rubbing her tummy, said \"There is no sword over our house.\" The pastor said he would consider the Sabbath change, but later after listening to some of his bishops, decided to continue Sunday as before. Several months later, I saw the wife in the Post Office. She smiled and said we now almost have a baseball team (children). But, then she came over to my friend and I as if she wanted to correct what she said. She then said in a low tone that the baby was stillborn. When I heard this I started to cry and she had to hold me up. True Story. Most Modern Christian have it totally wrong when it comes to angels. They like to romanticize angels and God too. But, God has help me to understand that there are different orders of Angels. We think that all angels are blue eyed, blond hair and White. But angels that look like that are ALL Destroying Angels. They are made of spirit and flames of fire. In other words their chemical make up is different therefore their appearance is also. Just as Hebrews, 1:7 says, \"My angels are ministering spirit and messengers or servants of fire.\" \n\nNow these White ones are created with elements of Phosphorus, which is highly combustible and ignites spontaneously in air and glows in the dark. They are also made up of Sulfur, which the bible refers to Brimstone. \n\nJust as humans are made of up of elements, so too is this type of angels. Lucifer and the order of angels that followed him were this same type of angel. That's why the Bible says, Satan comes as an angel of light, because that was what he was before he fell. Afterwards, he takes on that appearance and tricks humans.\n\nMany people who have dreams of seeing Jesus or angels and they describe them as White, blue eyed and blond hair have been mistaken. They are seeing either and destroying angel or a demon posing as Jesus or Yahshua. Here's why.\n\nGod nor Yahshua (Jesus) are ministering spirits. They are not Phosphorus/sulfuric made beings. I have personally seen both Yah and Yahshua in visions and here's how they look. They both have skin like Burnt Bronze, that looks like a deep smooth brown, just as the Word says. Both have a head full of curly hair, almost like an Afro but the curls are much more defined. Their eyes are brown and show much emotional expression. God YAH is larger in stature than Yahshua but Yahshua also has a strong build. They look similar to each other, but just different in the build. God looks a bit more authoritative, just like a Dad and son. \n\nAs the Word of God says, Satan has deceived the Whole world and now the mystery is about to be revealed. The Antichrist who has sold the world on this Phosphorus Destroying angel image, called \"Jesus\" is about to appear on the scene and many people are going to be seduced or tricked into worshiping him. It's going to be a terrible time for Christians, but more so for White Christians because they are so deeply rooted in this false God that many will fall down and worship him and loose their soul.",

Second, they can prolong your life if you are here on a mission by God.  Like me.   If an angel ask you how do you know if you died today would you go to heaven?  Your answer should be spoken very carefully.  The wrong answer will get you a ticket to hell once the Angels of Judgment whom have reviewed your life deemed you  the proper resting apart from your original existence.

Then your savior you have chosen will turn against you and shorten the days and time of your life. and then you wake up in the Abyss or Straight in the flames of the fire.  You can find Hell here on Earth.  You can burn yourself and get relief... in Hell there is no relief.   You can call upon evil spirits, angels of darkness, or you summoned them to you.  Be prepared for what appears to be of the darkness becomes darkness.  You will not see, smell,  know, hear the solid truth until your burning in the Flames Alive.

He said \"Now tell me about faith.\"\n\nHe replied, \"Faith means that you have faith in God, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day, and that you have faith in the measuring out, both its good and its evil.\"\n\nRemarking that he had spoken the truth, he then said, \"Now tell me about doing what is beautiful.\"\n\nHe replied, \"Doing what is beautiful means that you should worship God as if you see Him, for even if you do not see Him, He sees you.\"\n\nThen the man said, \"Tell me about the Hour\"  The Prophet replied, \"About that he who is questioned knows no more than the questioner.\"\n\nThe man said, \"Then tell me about its marks.\"\n\nHe said, \"The slave girl will give birth to her mistress, and you will see the barefoot, the naked, the destitute, and the shepherds vying with each other in building.\"\n\nThen the man went away. After I had waited for a long time, the Prophet said to me, \"Do you know who the questioner was, 'Umar?\" I replied, \"God and His messenger know best. \"He said, \"He was Gabriel. He came to teach you your religion. \"",

    "\" And the great Dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil,and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\" Revelation 12:9  Satan came as an angel of light in the wilderness of temptation to deceive Christ; and he does not come to man in a hideous form, as he is sometimes represented, but as an angel of light. We are warned that he will work with signs and lying wonders. 2 Thessalonians 2:9  And he will continue these wonders until the close of probation, that he may point to them as evidence that he is an angel of light and not of darkness. Satan will come personating Jesus Christ, working mighty miracles, and men will fall down and worship him as Jesus Christ. None need be deceived. When Christ shall make His appearance, it will be with power and great glory, accompanied by ten thousand times ten thousand angels and thousands of thousands.     The sheep's clothing seems so real, so genuine , that the wolf can be discerned only as we go to God's great moral standard and find that they are transgressors of the law of Jehovah. \"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ, and no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.\" 2 Corinthians  13-15    Again, None need be deceived. Read God's guide book, The Holy Bible, and hid it in your heart.",

It's best to first rule out ALL natural explanations and then, when one is completely unable to establish a natural explanation and there is a reasonable cause to believe in a supernatural (angelic) manifestation, then one can say that perhaps it is supernatural. However, it is usually easy to rule out if it's an angel if there's no purpose in the angel manifesting itself to man. Its doubtable that Angels simply appear for no purpose other than to \"show off\" if you will. God has typically sent angels to men for a reason, not just as a display.",

    "There is no scriptural evidence that people go to heaven when they die. There is evidence that we go to sleep. The Bible says the dead hear nothing, they see nothing, and they know nothing. Which makes a lot of sense because, we are resurrected from our resting place and then we stand before Yah, and we are judged according to what we did with the the Word and whether or not we kept His laws, statutes, and commandments. Then we will either receive eternal life where will live forever with Him HERE on Earth, after the Holy City is bought down from heaven. OR we will receive eternal condemnation and go into the Lake of Fire. The Bible also does not say that people go to hell either. Just sleep. And because we'll know nothing while we're asleep, when we wake up, no matter how long we have been asleep, we won't know how much time has passed. So it'll be like we died and went straight to judgement. It won't even feel like a day. Going to heaven or hell makes resurrection pointless and voids judgement, if we get our 'reward' as soon as we die. Why would He call us to the throne only to send us back where we came from? Hell is a holding place for disobedient angels because they can't be killed. Satan will be held there with them during the thousand years reign of Ma'shiach. Then he will be loosed and defeated once and for all, and cast into the Lake of Fire along with the demons and the unrighteous man.\nShalom.",

    "As the HOUR draws near, the interaction between the spiritual and the physical will increase with intensity.  Angels are messengers, (What message has this angel brought?!) ...God does not deal in fanciful apparitions! Read the bible and see every apparition of an angel of light is for the delivery of a message. As the Word indicates, we must be mindful for even fallen angels can present themselves as Angels of Light (e.g.Christ in the wilderness being tempted). Moreover, Satan himself will transform himself into and Angel of Light and deceive many presently living as He presents himself as Jesus Christ in a fantastic apparition which the world has never seen before. It is therefore important that we are not caught up with these manifestations too much, but rather diligently learn the Word of God and acquaint ourselves with his Character, then shall we make the distinction as lead by His spirit of Grace. Do not be deceived. ( Let us not forget that we ourselves were created just a little lower than angels clothed with light before the FALL of ADAM).  Many of the current apparitions are for excitement and to prepare hearts for the greatest deception the world has ever known. Read and understand. Search the scripture for the Truth. Do not be deceived.",

    "No. It's an extreme closeup of a moth with a truck in the background about 30 feet away parked in front of a one-story house. What appears to be the \"angel's\" sword is the outer edge of the roof of the house. If you look closely, you can see the front wall and corner of the house. Another reason the roof edge can't be a sword is that the \"angel\" would need to have a very long left arm that reached almost to their knees from a standing position to hold it at that angle. So the \"angel\" theory has been debunked. I don't know why this video has been re-uploaded, maybe to test the viewer's power of perception and how gullible they are?",

    "When I was studying photography in college, I learned to explain anomalies in photos. I can say with certainty that it isn\u2019t a moth. The bottom portion recessed behind the Truck. A moth only lets 5% of light through its wings, this object is emitting it\u2019s own light, which no species of moth does. After a light edit to the image, the complete humanoid structure is easily visible. I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s an angel, but it\u2019s something that is extraordinary and extraterrestrial in nature. Lens flare is impossible given the direction of light sources. My take is, that it\u2019s a legitimate photo of something that is hard to explain. I believe in god, but not some bearded dude in a robe. I think god is everything and everywhere. I think even we are part of god, which is why we can\u2019t see god. It\u2019s like your hand seeing you, it\u2019s impossible. Angels on the other hand, not sure...",
    "Yup!! Sorry to say this... but the sword is actually the electrical wiring from the back house, you can see it more clearly on the second picture, when the moth moves..

    "Pastor Don Piper was dreaming. And all those people who believe in his dreams as reality are vehemently doomed. The Bible it's self says nobody goes to heaven and come back to earth and only Jesus came from heaven and he's the only one who has ever gone to heaven alive, although it contradicts it's self, we can leave that alone and rest assured that Pastor Don Piper was dreaming or he had a mental problem when he was in coma. \nMost of us have heard dreams seeing ourselves dead or traveling in a different vicinity but we've never came out to declare that we went to heaven. \nBack to the picture it might be true because God protects us all. Islam teaches us that every man has two Angels assigned to him/her by the Almighty God. These angels perform different tasks. Besides God mercy covers all the sinners and the righteous that's why a thief or a murderer can go uncaught.",
    "My husband met Micheal the archangel and saw others, and through a skylight, saw Jesus, Micheal took him and explained how everything and everyone is connected and works and that science is god, they can\u2019t disprove god because he made it all. He said the angels were beautiful but he spoke to Micheal who had a sword. This was just a few months ago when he was in a coma and it\u2019s a beautiful story and I love to hear it",
    "I believe in angels but the Bible also says in many places the dead hear, see, dream not...they are asleep waiting for the resurrection.  If there is a return by Christ and a resurrection you wouldn't go to heaven right away.  I know personally two people, one was my mother, another a very close friend who died (flat lined) and were brought back to life with the paddles.  Both saw nothing.  There is only one line in the Bible that people jump on to believe in going straight to heaven, the absent from the body, present with the Lord which can be interpreted in other ways than being with God in heaven.  Where then is the judgment phase the Bible speaks of...I'm sure this pastor believes what he saw but I really question its reality.  I just wonder how he explains the contradictory Bible passages that give a different scenario.",
    "I believe it was an angel, we all have angels watching over us. I've seen them before, they are very large and can be very scary. Anywhere in the Bible that an angel appears they say \"don't be afraid\". I believe this angel was sent to protect their travel.",
    "I am a RN  an have seen a many people die, old and young. Some from natural causes, some accidents. So many of them, a family member included, die with a peaceful look on their face that we all loved to see, almost a smile.  It was horrible because there were a few, not a lot thank God, who didn\u2019t die peacefully.  One haunts me to this day, a younger lady died of cancer, as she died, she appeared to see something, sat straight up in her bed which she did not have the strength to do and let out a blood curdling scream that was heard all over the floor.  She fell back and died. No one talked, every one was just silent, it was awful. Don\u2019t tell me there are not Angels,  and unfortunately, I think there are also demons lurking waiting to steal our soles.      If the photo is an angel great, if not great, it opened a wonderful discussion. I want to believe it is an Angel myself, but we can all believe what we want.",
    "That\u2019s not an angel.  It\u2019s a MOTH.  \n\nWhy would an angel show himself to a camera but not a person?

    "Several years ago I awoke in the middle of the night and shot straight up in my bed with an overwhelming sense of urgency to go look up the book of Mathew. While reading the entire book  into the early hours of the morning I had the strangest sensation radiating from what seemed to be the very center of my being! It was a warm, vibration like sensation which spread outward from my diaphragm toward my extremities with an overwhelming sense of happiness and deep understanding! Every word I read suddenly became absolutely clear and imparted deep meaning as if the words were speaking to me on a spiritual level like I had never experienced before! Just before the sun rose I again felt an overwhelming sense of urgency, this time...to go to the Lake and watch the sun rise over the water.  \nWatching the sun come up that morning I became overwhelmed with emotions as if it were the most beautiful thing I would ever experience in my life and I was brought to tears over the absolute beauty of it all! I pulled out my smart phone to capture as many photographs as I could, feeling like I would never get an opportunity like this again! I snapped photo after photo, 100 plus to be honest, briefly thinking I was crazy for doing so as I had seen a sunrise more than once before and this one was not so different from the others... or was it? \n\nWhen I got home I uploaded the photos and was shocked to see numerous photos which absolutely blew my mind! The most important  few of the many images I took that morning was the unmistakable image of Jesus Christ from head to toe,  in such detail that everyone I showed the image to immediately, and without a word from my mouth said...  \"that's Jesus\"!  \nSome of the other images were of flying doves and what appeared to be a hooded angel with wings, peering through an opening at the top of a tree... and many more! Utterly mind boggling!",
    "My first son died at home with me. He was nine years old. He kept asking me if I would let him go to Jesus.

He gave me a big smile, closed his eyes still smiling and took his last breath.",

Just got to keep your head up and stop looking down everywhere you go.  My experiences with Jesus are far different than the claims of that pastor but it's not my place to judge such claims.  Jesus the Christ is ever present with us all, more so ever than I've ever sensed before. \n\nMaybe that pastor should reference something other than the backwards written Hebrews. Such as, oh \n2 Corinthians 13:5\n\"Or do you not realise something about YOURSELVES that Jesus Christ is in you \".  \n\nknow his truth and massive love, then maybe each and everyone will trust as he instructed. \nAs his message and preaching was not with wise and persuasive words, but with demonstration of the spirits power, so that ypur faith might not rest on human's wisdom, but instead on gods power\". \n(1 Corinthians 2:4-5)\ud83d\udd46\nMeaning seek him with in yourselves,  hoping each individual can find full FAITH.\nAfter all, faith is believing.",

    "Yep... every car and truck has it's own gaurdian angel. I want to believe But it's just not adding up. If angels can disguise themselves or just not be seen at all then why would there be a picture of one. Furthermore if there was to be real video/ picture evidence it would be by the grace of God and serve a purpose. Therefore it would be clear as day and no blurry image that could be considered anything else from creation.",
    "Looks like some kinda mothman to me. It's not exactly Micheal the arch angel in the movie Frailty. It's an apparition of unknown source. Angels do  not have wings such as the greek and roman gods do not. It's a metaphor which suggest supernatural capability.",

    "Chapter 24\u2014\u201cDestroyed for Lack of Knowledge\u201d\nGod's favor toward Israel had always been conditional on their obedience. At the foot of Sinai they had entered into covenant relationship with Him as His \u201cpeculiar treasure... above all people.\u201d Solemnly they had promised to follow in the path of obedience. \u201cAll that the Lord hath spoken we will do,\u201d they had said. Exodus 19:5, 8. And when, a few days afterward, God's law was spoken from Sinai, and additional instruction in the form of statutes and judgments was communicated through Moses, the Israelites with one voice had again promised, \u201cAll the words which the Lord hath said will we do.\u201d At the ratification of the covenant, the people had once more united in declaring, \u201cAll that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient,\u201d Exodus 24:3, 7. God had chosen Israel as His people, and they had chosen Him as their King. PK 293.1\nNear the close of the wilderness wandering the conditions of the covenant had been repeated. At Baalpeor, on the very borders of the Promised Land, where many fell a prey to subtle temptation, those who remained faithful renewed their vows of allegiance. Through Moses they were warned against the temptations that would assail them in the future; and they were earnestly exhorted to remain separate from the surrounding nations and to worship God alone. PK 293.2\n\u201cNow therefore hearken,\u201d Moses had instructed Israel, \u201cunto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you. Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.... Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.\u201d Deuteronomy 4:1-6. PK 294.1\nThe Israelites had been specially charged not to lose sight of the commandments of God, in obedience to which they would find strength and blessing. \u201cTake heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently,\u201d had been the word of the Lord to them through Moses, \u201clest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons\u2019 sons.\u201d Verse 9. The awe-inspiring scenes connected with the giving of the law at Sinai were never to be forgotten. Plain and decided were the warnings that had been given Israel against the idolatrous customs prevailing among the neighboring nations. \u201cTake ye ... good heed unto yourselves,\u201d was the counsel given; \u201clest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure,\u201d \u201cand lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.\u201d \u201cTake heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which He made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of anything, which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.\u201d Verses 15, 16, 19, 23.

    "It's clearly a moth bumping into the security camera lens. It looks translucent because it was flapping its wings when the image was taken. Remember old cell cameras? They blur if you barely move them. Same thing with this low-quality security camera. Sorry to bust the bubble, but angels don't randomly appear. Otherwise they would reveal themselves in major cities, making believers out of 100% of the world population. Oh and the sword...it's a diffraction spike from the porch light reflecting off the moth. And why would angels have such tiny heads anyway?",
    "Before this video on Angels, fox had a short video on the current shooting, which was today 5/18/18,.  the video lasted about  30 seconds or so, then went right into this video of angels..   They didn't mention anything on how to curb gun violence..  Just as long as they don't try to help out in any real way, except for making sure \"the sale of guns doens't get disturbed\"!!  So they talk about Angels!  Are they trying to say, that if you get shot and killed, it's a good thing, because they get to talk about angels??  So what, it's a good thing to get shot and killed because, you'll become an angel??  Hey Fox, try helping society out for a change!!",

It\u2019s a bit of an illusion, the moth is very close to the camera which gives the impression that it\u2019s bigger than it really is. It also gives the false impression that the subject is further away from the camera and over the truck. If you look at the body of the subject it is quite broad with a small head at the top, this indicates to me that it\u2019s probably an insect.",
    "Look at the light shining on the truck! This is obviously a moth in front of the camera. I believe in angels believe in heaven and hell but this is not an angel.

Angels with 6,4,2 and no wings come on that's rediculous. He is making a mockery of ppl who believe in God and angels and heaven.",
    "My take,... we have birds. An animal that developed wings for flight on THIS planet. With all the life in the universe, what's to say that humanoids on another planet developed wings as well? Now if both species die and go to the same afterlife and like this guy, someone in the distance past could have came back and labeled them Angels, large people with wings. Now humans adore them as holy entities on the other side and they know it and are attracted to the idolization of humans and follow us back. As you can see, this Angel, like Archangel Michael, was a warrior.\nI believe the picture, the guys story, just not the analogy. And that my take.",

I do surveillance for a living and have seen lots of bugs on cams. I want to see the moving surveillance. I do believe though, surveillance has captured many unexplained things. And I agree with the pastor on this video, the bible says angels are always around us.  I am also a real spirit photographer.  Spirits are always around us too.  I have an amazing video that looks just like a real ghost moving throughout a room walking around, and it would convince everyone if I edited it just right, but if you watch the entire footage and witness the latter movements it is in fact a spider.  I can't share my video because it's of someone else's property.  Just saying, I have certainly seen and photographed real entities, and I have seen many unusual things on the surveillance I do at work, but most can be explained.  Once someone tried to post images of a ghost in a parking lot hovering between cars, but a trained surveillance person could tell it was the wind carrying exhaust from a vehicle.",
    "This guy needs to re-read his bible.  Because it does say that in the end times those who are dead in Christ will rise up first.

A force of energy lifting u in a different direction to avoid further harm. These are but a few personal experiences. Please there are many books on angels at the library and book stores.  There is a magazine with first hand experiences.  Google angles and spiritual experiences to see what comes up. Also u-tube.   Do not permit those who have not been so blessed deter you.

    "I'm the bible when anything miraculous happens it's usually to point towards Christ.  Most of the angels encountered in the Bible describe then as looking like men.  Only reference to wings is on the cherubim which add I understand it is symbolic.  The other thing about miracles is that they help someone in some way.\n\nSo the question to ask is, what purpose did this \"sighting\" serve?  Did it help save their lives? Did it in some way lead someone to Christ?  If the answer to either of these questions is no then I submit that whether this sighting Is supernatural or not it's probably not from God.",
    "To my own observation of this image, could be a moth, because of the wing shape. If you look at the left wing on the left side, you can see how the shape and the head look a bit like a moth got into the camera lens. That's my rational opinion. But who know?",

    "THAT'S A MOTH. A South Afrimerican Nollopulogenuos Mothosyphicusthingy species. Although rare in Michigan, they are quite common in Ohio, Alabama and Bus stops. They were bred from the American House Moth and Tiny African Warriors with wicked small penises, (That's a Sword BTW) They live mostly on Plants, Worms and Tacos, but they also really like small children, Not to Eat, Just to play with. Their favorite game is Hop Scotch, But, unlike other species of moths, the Nollopulogenuos has a tendency to cheat at Hopscotch. However, uncommon to their deceptive Hopscothing, this particular species of moth is monogamous and mates for life, although they rank 3rd according to FBI Statistics in 2015 for Domestic Violence cases among winged creatures, behind The Sparrow and Bees, Bumble, I think?

    "IRAN IS WORLD IS LARGEST STATE SPONSOR OF INTERCONTINENTAL TERRORISM\nOctober 23, 1983 - 241 US service personnel -- including 220 Marines and 21 other service personnel -- are killed by a truck bomb at a Marine compound in Beirut, Lebanon.\nThree hundred service members had been living at the four-story building at the airport in Beirut. There were 1,800 Marines stationed in Beirut at the time.\nA multi-national force with units from France, Italy and the United Kingdom was also on peacekeeping duty in Lebanon at the same time.\nAt the same time the Marine barracks was hit, a suicide bomber drove a pickup truck full of explosives and crashed into a building housing French paratroopers. Approximately 58 French soldiers were killed in the attack.\nThe bombing was traced to Hezbollah, a militant and TERRORIST group that originated in Lebanon in 1982. both Iranian ROGUE regime and Syrian MURDEROUS regime were behind the assault !\n\nThe April 18, 1983, United States embassy bombing was a suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. The victims were mostly embassy and CIA staff members, but also included several U.S. soldiers and one U.S. Marine Security Guard. It was the deadliest attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission up to that time, and is considered the beginning of Iran attacks on U.S. targets. \n\nA pro-Iranian group calling itself Hezbollah terrorist Organization took responsibility for the bombing in a telephone call to a news office immediately after the blast. The anonymous caller said, \"This is part of the Iranian revolution's campaign against free world targets throughout the world. We shall keep striking at any crusader presence in Lebanon, including the international forces.\"\n(The terrorst group had earlier taken responsibility for a grenade attack in which five U.S. members of the international peacekeeping force had been wounded.)\n\nJudge John Bates of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. on September 8, 2003, awarded in a default judgment, $123 million to 29 American victims and family members of Americans killed in the bombing. Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. on May 30, 2003, determined that the bombing was carried out by the terror group Hezbollah with the approval and financing of senior Iranian officials, paving the way for the victims to seek damages. The trial had opened March 17. Iran was not present in court to challenge witnesses nor present evidence of their own.\n\nIn 1992 and 1994, two bombs devastated the Argentinean Jewish community and marked the arrival of Middle Eastern terrorism to South America.\n\nThe Israeli Embassy in Argentina's capital of Buenos Aires was the site of the first explosion - a car bomb - on March 17, 1992. The attack killed 29 people and injured more than 250 others. Among the victims were Israeli diplomats, children, clergy from a church located across the street, and other passersby. The investigation of the case was assigned to Argentina's Supreme Court and the Chief Justice Ricardo Levene was given the task of investigating and presenting his findings to the court. For over two years, however, the investigation languished and virtually no action was taken, despite the fact that IRANIAN Jihad had claimed responsibility for the explosion.\n\nIt was not until July 18, 1994, that the case received serious attention. On that date, the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) Jewish community center in Buenos Aires was bombed - 87 people were killed and over 100 people were injured. This time, Judge Jose Galeano was assigned to investigate the case but, like Judge Levene, he made little progress.\n\nLater in 1994 came the first of several breakthroughs in the embassy bombing case. Six Lebanese SHIIA citizens and one Brazilian, arrested for operating a drug cache, were found to be members of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist organization. The Argentine government immediately announced that the men were tied to the embassy bombing",

Why???\n\nChinese send metal products to Canada and Mexico and then, use NAFTA free trade practices to dump them to the U.S. cheaply. This benefits investor class but not the ordinary American people and American national security. The price we pay for a car is going up and not going down though Chinese dump metal products using NAFTA. We pay doubled the price for the same car that we used to buy 18 years ago. This is true for anything else... We see prices go up and real income goes down as jobs and manufacturing going out of the country.\n\nIf free trade is the norm, let all parties have open tariffs. That's what Trump proposes...We have different specialties and let the market forces decide trade balances. However, it doesn't work; and very stupid if so called trade agreements post 270% tax to U.S. and expect zero taxation reciprocally. President Trump needs free and fair trade with reciprocity.\n\nAny nation can huff and puff but U.S. would ultimately win as they are still the largest market. Trump use that common sense and he would navigate interim hiccups through other means such as petroleum, currency and interest rates... that guy knows playing multi dimensional Chess :-) ...\n\nTrump wants to give life to inner cities where many low income and black workers lost their jobs due to metal and coal plants closure during past two decades.\n\nOn the other hand, U.S. almost lost all technology infrastructure related to metal manufacturing and if a war between U.S. and China happens someday; there's a huge risk of a shortage of engineering infrastructure and skilled labor in metal industry and the U.S. will have to depend on our possible future enemies for metal supply. That's why it is a security threat and it is multi-dimensional; ranging from immigration, technology, financial, information, currency and so on...\n\nPresident Trump sees long range and applying correctional strategies when U.S. economy is strong. No leader can work on tariffs with energy and metals when the economy is weak but do it when all goes well before it is too late.\n\nWhen metal industry starts up... feeding industries starting from coal prospers and all of these are inter related...\n\nGo Trump!

Lets talk about job promotion for blacks and hiring discriminatory practices against blacks applying for higher quality jobs, like internal applicants within a company/agency/organization for higher positions with better salaries after accuring years of experience from entry level positions. Lets truely talk about progress for black Ameicans.",

    "I think there is an aspect of victim mentality that is still present in a subset of the black community. Many blacks in the underprivileged neighbourhoods seem to give up before they have even tried, instead of giving it their best, going out in the world and finding out that they will actually be treated on merit, just like everyone else.\n\nWhile I believe that there is definite racism, I do not believe it is cultural. I also don't believe in inherent cultural 'white privilege'. The only colour capitalism cares about is green. Those who put in the effort get rewarded. Nepotism and favouritism are not so prevalent that it could be considered a cultural variable. I'm no expert but to me it looks like the reason many blacks aren't braking out into the world is because of opportunistic and divisive identity politics.\n\nEvery time someone wants to win over the black vote they go for the easiest card - victimhood ie. 'you people are so oppressed, discriminated against and abused. Elect me and I will change that'. Do that to a people for decades and what do you get? A cultural victim mentality that, ironically, enslaves the mind while purporting to try to free the person. It seems that the powers that be would rather have the poor among the blacks on welfare than achieving, and that is where they have kept them. They are more easily won over come election that way. It's all about the votes. Always. That is why I hate political opportunism like this. Blacks could and should be just as successful as everyone else if not for those constantly poisoning their minds in order to get elected.",

The fact that it is the left who are violent (and the leftist media along with hillary and Bernie refuse to call them out on it) just exposes their fascist tendencies that has nothing to do with what Donald Trump says - other than they don't like it.

    "Notice how Fowler flat out lies about the things Trump has said. I'll quote him, \"it's Donald j Trump who's inciting violence and hatred towards people. When you say you don't want Muslims here, when you say you want to deport people. .\"\n\nNo Richard, what he said is he \"wants to vet Muslims before they enter the country\".

See, in the Progressive mind, it is acceptable for BLM to question the integrity of white cops, but it's a sin for a white man to wonder whether a judge might be biased because of his ethnic heritage.",
    "Please note the Trump campaign staffer, quietly and politely waited her turn to speak her mind when this interview started while he spoke, but when she started to speak it was only moments until he at first quietly started interrupting her with a quiet \"Katrina, Katrina, Katrina\" then more loudly began insisting on interrupting her. I am not comparing a obvious pacifist to these thugs but he shows the basic problem with the PC left, they simply have no real respect for others rights of free speech, only their own no matter what they say, as they say actions speak louder than words and his ever increasing efforts to interrupt her speak volumes about their basic hypocrisy.\n\nThen he begins the rationalization and deflection, he compares an off handed remark in poor taste by Trump and a couple of very isolated incidents by violent Trump supporters with wholesale mass violence even directed at women and elderly men at not just this event but several now by the anti Trump crowd that quickly devolved into riots, people actually chasing fleeing Trump supporters down and attacking them, cornering women, and sneaking up from behind Trump supporters walking away to violently assault them in the head with objects and this is not just at this event, at others there were similar incidents such as a man's face smashed in when a Trump protestor turned a bull horn into a club, or when a innocent police horse was pushed over which could easily have broken its legs which could have ended in its death, or when a protestor pepper sprayed two parents innocently walking past but hit their children. This is a pattern of extremely violent behaviour by large numbers of people not just a couple of incidents like with Trump and its getting worse with each protest because the police are terrified to take action lest the PC media and PC politicians attack them and destroy their lives like in Ferguson, this lack of action or even strong immediate condemnation by the media and politicians only emboldens them further and escalates the violence. \n\nThey blame the victim, their excuse is \"he promotes and incites violence\" for one he absolutely does not, that is a fallacy a meme, but lets suppose he does promote violence for arguments sake, first of all obviously almost none of his followers commit violence, you can count the incidents on one hand, second does someone talking about violence against you excuse you actually committing violence against a innocent third party who merely went to hear him speak? A couple final points, at a Trump rally before he comes out to speak there is a message asking everyone to not react to provocation or engage in any violence so the meme that he is promoting violence is an absolute and complete lie. FYI I would like to point out I am a lifelong Democrat, in no way a right winger, I supported Bernie early on, but like most Americans I  have had enough of this PC Fascism and race baiting from the far left. My final point Fox what the hell are you doing? you are supposed to conduct a fair interview with these opposing sides, why did the moderator let him speak almost not stop, he easily received three times the speaking time of her, do your job, tell him to give her a chance at a rebuttal and fair time or you will cut off his mike.",

Everyone knows damn good and well that if Trump supporters protested\u00a0at a Clinton or a\u00a0Sanders' rally like these\u00a0anti-Trump\u00a0animals carry on, the media would be calling for Trump's head on a platter.",

    "All forms of violence are wrong but where was this outrage when a protestor was beaten at a Trump rally in Birmingham, Alabama. Lastly they couldn't argue with him so they abruptly ended the segment, LOSERS!",
    "Because a segment of them secretly support violence against those they disagree with, specifically the Social Justice Warrior crowd, the Black Lives Matter folks and the supporters of illegal immigration as well as the establishment authoritarian bunch like Hillary. There is zero respect for free speech or our Constitution, they basically ideologically want a one party state like the USSR or Nazi Germany, at least ideologically all must think alike or at least keep silent if they disagree at a minimum. \n\nThis ideology is a product of both indoctrination in  our university system and from our media, especially the youth focused media and minority focused media like MTV, Telemundo, MSNBC and BET. I originally believed they most closely resembled McCarthyism in their tactics historically but in retrospect I see more and more in common ideologically with the Nazi's because much of their ideology is focused around demonization of whites, especially white males similar to Nazi demonization of Jews, blaming them for all the world's problems, they also share much of the same propaganda tactics, they preach a victim ideology to motivate hatred just like the Nazi's who claimed the German people were the \"victims\" of the WW1 Allies, the Communists and the Jews, no matter what happened or what they did they were the \"real victims\" and thus that excused them from anything violent they did, they also preach, just like the Nazi's, an ideological sense of entitlement \"you deserve this and that\". (No I do not believe they advocate genocide or war conquests like the Nazi's, I am purely speaking about some of their ideology and tactics having a superficial level of similarity to the Nazi party, a 4 to the Nazi's 10+ level of extremism, but its getting worse).\n\nThese people are becoming increasingly violent especially with the addition of gang members and low level cartel employees with the usual anarchist crowd. I fully expect things to escalate, in part because police are terrified to do their job and deal with anyone who is a minority because they know the PC media and PC politicians will destroy them like they did to the officer in Ferguson. When Trump wins in November look for these nuts to go bat shit crazy and start killing people in several ugly incidents which will spark retaliation which will escalate out of control  if we do not deal with them soon while we still can, I would not be shocked to see them start a virtual civil war in November, which we all know Obama will not deal with in his last three months in office, the country's urban centers will fall apart into violent chaos while he tells everyone its not his fault. FYI I am not some right wing nut, I have been a life long Democrat and was supportive of Bernie early on and still pray he defeats that lying, corporate owned criminal Hillary. I believe I am looking at the situation from a Political Science, Historical and Cultural perspective since that is what my degrees and training are in. I firmly believe we have political and historical similarities here between the PC movement as it is being expressed by its more radical elements I mentioned above and other radical ideologies that flourished in the early twentieth century.

There is a line, that once it is crossed, they cease being protesters and are then \"terrorists\" and this was clearly evident the other day. When a group of people use verbal abuse, destruction of property and violence and threat of further violence in order to scare people from showing up at rallies or into doing something or not doing something, THAT IS TERROR! THAT is WHAT terrorists do. Until people stop being scared of calling it what it is, it may not get better but only worse. You should start calling it WHAT IT IS!

The recent caravan of bogus asylum seekers from South America is the latest wave of migrants taking advantage of naive sympathizers who believe the U.S. should be a battered wife shelter for anyone who can't manage the basic skills of living in their own country. \n\nIn fact, thousands of  migrants from all over the world have already been resettled in the U.S. and the cost of providing them with social and economic services is placing an enormous burden on the communities where they're now residing. Along with curbing the resettlement of refugees and rejecting obviously bogus applications for asylum, Trump's proposal to dismantle Temporary Protected Status and DACA/Dreamer is another remedy that can't be implemented fast enough.",

All of the social justice movements,, including this insane immigrant/refugee agenda is bought and paid for by Soros and his friends.....all enemies of the USA.  All the leaders of these illogical social movements, many politicians and a whole lot of public speakers and actors in Hollywood are paid and trained by the Soros agenda.  His foundation trained and paid all these people to go into recognizable social groups to manipulate people into anger, hatred,blaming, marching, rioting, creating chaos....

If you were truly escaping threats to your _life,_ you would gladly and enthusiastically accept asylum in the _first_ country you got to, especially when that country already speaks your language, has a similar climate, customs, traditions, political beliefs and people to yourself.  Their refusal to accept Mexico's offer is EVIDENCE of their true intent and it is grounds for IMMEDIATE refusal to let a single one of them cross from Mexico into the US.  The US citizens have the right and the duty to protect their own nation, culture and uphold our laws of OUR society which WE have chosen for OURSELVES.   Prepare for a ground battle and guerilla-style combat because that's exactly what this foreign hostile invasion is going to incur.  The US citizens are fed up with our government/law enforcement not doing its job.  They seem to forget that they work for _us_ and if they aren't capable of doing the job we've hired them to do for us, we'll dismiss them, stop paying them and take matters into our own hands.

    "It still is and always will be in the hands of the hand that rocks the cradle.   I was in both places and when I did work for the states that I worked, it was remarkable how the people that had the heart for it appeared and the mothering or fathering seemed to come naturally by those who chose that field to work in.  Mostly, it was people that just plain had a natural instinct for what was needed, and in many cases, filled in the gap that was lacking at home and in their youth.  I served in NJ and CA and saw both the East and the West and the one thing that came through was the humanity coming to the front every time.  I am here because I am happy to see something being done to improve the situation that parolees face but more importantly, to educate the people of the importance of those that \"rock the cradle\".  It goes back to the basics of \"family first\".   It always concerns the basics and beliefs that are instilled in the young.  In my own case, it was my grandparents more than anyone else in my early youth.   We all need role models and those that grew up tv role models more than family role models are the ones that have the hard time.",

    "The prison system needs to be reform and become a place that reinforced good human ethical and moral responsibility to building a better society.

    "The prison system should not have racial segregation within its walls, even though this comes naturally, however, if people are going to love and respect each other, then the prison system is the best place to start learning how to love each other. Black and white people need to learn how to love each other; if not by natural nature then it must be by forceful means within the prison walls.",
    "Prison reform\nThe prison system should stop being a place of merely punishment and become a place for real rehabilitation toward training and educational achievement. Young black men in the prison system should be given the opportunity to learn new skills and also to learn better reading and write skills. They should be given the opportunity to learn from the kindergarten level to earning an undergraduate academic Associate degree. \nThese skill training should be a focus on learning computer science, farming, mechanical engineering, Construction engineering, culinary art, Personal hygiene and food processing skills. Learning these skills would help them to start acting and thinking responsible. The secret to accomplishment in the prison system is the continual learning of new skills or education. Whether an inmate has earned an advanced degree or is just beginning a new career, it\u2019s always a good idea to continue learning new skills in the prison system. The skills learning opportunity could help to reshape the inmate\u2019s mindset, thus making it possible to remove the inherent ignorance to make them a better productive citizen in their country. \nThese academic and new learning skills could ensure that young black people can become marketable in an increasingly competitive working environment. Just to be locking up a person in a prison cell, and treat them life wild animals cannot solve the problem of crime; instead, it will only make them become more perverted inherent people. Therefore I would propose that one the best way to help these inmates; it\u2019s to transform their mind from a dark place to one of learning new skills that is the link to knowledge enlightenment.     The prison system should not have racial segregation within its walls, even though this comes naturally, however, if people are going to love and respect each other, then the prison system is the best place to start learning how to love each other. Black and white people need to learn how to love each other; if not by natural nature then it must be by forceful means within the prison walls. The prison system needs to be reform and become a place that reinforced good human ethical and moral responsibility to building a better society. I think that it would be a good idea to allow the good behaving inmate to have private intimate time with their wives or girlfriends visiting the prison, this would help to promote good behavior and reduce the act of homosexuality and violence within the prisons.   The prison system should promote and organize a competitive sporting activity, such as boxing, basketball, baseball, and track and field games, with the aim of getting inmates to play in professional games after they leave prison. After leaving prison an inmate prison record should not be available to the general public so that companies could not use it to disqualify former inmate job seekers.",

    "So, I think the most important issues are:\n\n1. Reducing/eliminating incarceration for victimless crimes.\n2. Sunsetting public access to criminal records, and/or the requirement to disclose a record, after a certain number of years. In general I would suggest that the record be sealed and disclosure requirements be limited to 3 years from sentence completion for misdemeanors. 5 years for non-violent felonies, and 7 years for violent felonies.\n3. Full and immediate rights restoration for non-violent offenders (upon sentence completion) and gun rights restoration after 5 years (from sentence completion) for violent offenders.\n4. Re-education / career development while incarcerated.\n5. Tax incentives for employers who hire felons.\n6. Elimination of prison labor. If prisoners work, they should make a competitive wage and be able to send that money home. Slavery is wrong regardless of the setting.\n7. Elimination/tight regulation of private correctional systems. They are far too corrupt.\n\nObviously, law enforcement would be able to access records for any suspect with a warrant.\n\nThis \"Jubilee\" approach provides an opportunity for those that change to re-establish themselves in life and better provide for their families.",

    "I live in Augusta, GA and I have a 40% disability which qualified me for an educational program with the VA. I was repeatedly told by my counselor, during the four years I was in the program, that the V.A does not help with Bachelors degrees and that there are no jobs in the computer science field. I was only allowed Associate degrees in a Vocational tech school and at Troy University which doesn't do anything to help get a job. They all want Bachelor degrees or experience. I repeatedly told this to my counselor but kept getting denied. While I was at Troy, I kept running across black people in my class, during introductions, that said they were voc rehab students and they were getting there Bachelors in such and such. While at the same time my counselor kept telling me the opposite. I went to the veterans office at Troy and she told me that there were plenty of voc rehab students getting their Bachelors but yet my counselor kept telling me that the voc rehab program does not do that.\nI finally caved from pressure in the realization that I will never get a job. I could not even buy my daughter a prom dress much less pay the bills. The pressure of having to go back to kindergarten twice really weighed on my mind while at the same time I knew all these other black veterans were getting an education. I was really mad and I am still to this day.\nThe job I have now has nothing to do with my education and it hurts ever day and is more physically demanding but a few years ago a young man was hired because of his bachelors in chemistry and his starting salary was twice that of mine and he was one of my bosses. I later found out he was a voc rehab student himself so I cautiously approached him with the subject and said \"Do you know Mr. White\" not saying his first name on purpose. He said \"James White, Yeah I got him fired. He was only allowing blacks to get their Bachelors and I got them to go through his records and he was discriminating against whites\"!\nSo, in other words, every white disabled soldier in Augusta, Ga was discriminated against that went through him and I was one of them. It is too late for me now and I cant even describe the words how I feel about it. All I remember is all these black people getting their education while I was denied mine.",

The white race built civilization to suite their needs & desires by their own kind for their own kind. Each race lives & prospers differently. Other races want to live in what the white race built. The only thing worse to other races then living in a country surrounded by white people is to not be able to live in a civilization they built. This is not our problem, nor is it our fault.

Not only is it a massive tax increase on Americans, it can ultimately lead to the complete financial collapse of the world.  Collectively, those allies owns most of the US national debt that the republicans just raised.

    "Just thought I would take the chance to offer some slight corrections. America entered ww2, two years after it started in 1939 due to the attack on pearl harbour by Japan, a nation Britain was also fighting at the time in the Pacific.\n\nHowever, during this time America did help Britain by supplying military equipment such as tanks, planes and guns to aid in the war effort. Not because of our \u201cspecial relationship\u201d but because it was finically beneficial after the great depression. The American public was against entering another war after the lives lost in ww1. \n\nI think it\u2019s classless to make a statement about \u201clet\u2019s see them protest when the German\u2019s come back, flying over London\u201d. I mean firstly Germany is a democratic country avidly against war and secondly saying the British are some how \u201cungrateful\u201d as \u201cwe\u2019ve\u201d chosen to protest against the state visit of a polarising character. \n\nA visit that now appears disguised as a summit about our trade going forward when in truth it seems more like a vanity project for Donald Trump. With the country in a bit of a state because of the tiresome brexit negotiations the tax payers have had to pay millions to ensure his safety. An expense the country can barely afford. \n\nPeople died in that war for the rights of those people to protest against anything they like, including a man they see as a tyrant. Whether you think they\u2019re right or not doesn\u2019t make a difference. \n\n\nIt\u2019s true when they say that history is written by the victorious. \n\nSo I think it\u2019s time to drop the notion of America riding in like the sheriff in a cowboy western. At first, America profited off the war in Europe and then joined after Japan bombed pearl harbour and public opinion shifted. Not to help out the \u201cLimey\u2019s\u201d\n\n\nYes, the war could have ended very differently without America\u2019s involvement, but a small island with an already depleted army stood up against a tyrant and fought a battle it knew it could never win. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201clefty\u201d having a go, this is somebody who has taken the time to educate themselves on the facts of history, not re-writing it to elevate his already inflated ego. \n\nTo be honest I know this post will be viewed as \u201clefty Brit\u201d having a moan but if Just one person reads this and doesn\u2019t feel the need to spew vile shit my direction I will be happy.\n\n\nI\u2019m happy America got involved in ww2, as was my grandfather who fought in it, but not if it came at the expense that years later the historical accuracy is manipulated to fit a political agenda. \n\nMaybe the lady should read a book or two, as Inglorious Bastards is a film, not a documentary.",

You go to get a blood test and you might pay five dollars for a single band aid. At every level of our health care system, including the \"nonprofit\" hospitals, there are people, most of whom are not medical professionals, who are making millions off of other peoples pain and suffering. I did a study on this in college and when you add up the profit taking for goods and services to patients, it amounts to minimum of 1/3 of the money taken in. This will never happen but to have socialized medicine and make it work in the US, we would need to nationalize the health care industry all at once and from top to bottom. We would also need to look at how socialized medicine worked around the world, take the Canada model and tweak it to get rid of the inefficiencies and adjust it for the differences in our societies.

    "Hail hail Trump is here what the heck do democrats know for its a good old way to run your country but what the hell do democrats care for they only know that they missed the actual show cause Bernie Sanders is a fool, Cortez knows nothing about politics, nothing about Israel \ud83d\ude0b she's a kid ruling over adults (sad day in the world) children ruling over their elders it's disrespectful, disgusting, not to mention fulfilling the Holy Bible again\ud83d\ude18",
    "The problem now is that Marxists are trying to rebrand themselves as benign \"democratic socialist.\" But they are wolves in sheep's clothing and dangerous. For example Bernie Sanders. He hung out in Soviet Russia not Sweden. He's no \"democratic socialist nor is Scandinavia. They are Capitalists with a few social programs as safety nets. But immigrants went there for the safety nets so they will now crash.",
    "The reason why \"Democratic\" Socialism and Universal Healthcare won't work in America is specifically because of population. We're a nation of 325 million people with rampant illegal immigration while Scandinavian countries have less than 100 million people in their countries and until recently, relatively little immigration, illegal or otherwise. You can only guarantee something for so many people until you run out of guarantees.",

See I like listening to Fox News and agree with much of their content: the threat of Islamic immigration, the threat of social engineering and political correctness, the right to bear arms and strong borders, it just goes to crap when they start talking about economic matters. But you don't have to throw the baby out with the bath water...",

Yes let's just bullshit about those countries and slander them. \n\nAnd this is funny coming from a man who pushed the policies of the Bush administration when he was a toady for Bill O'Reilly and look what that got us. \n\nLet's remember this is a man who comes from a wealthy family. Who for years said nothing about his boss Bill O'Reilly sexualy harrassing a woman, who went after a president over his birth certificate and religious beliefs. Who attacks others over there private lives while he himself was cheating on his wife.",

    "Cortez didn't campaign as a Social Democrat, although she is one.  She doesn't want to identify with Socialism, it is a distraction?    Is this what she wants to represent,  to deny who she is politically?  What kind of scam is this?  Are the voters of America this ignorant to let this snake into the parlor?  She's in and I sincerely believe her election was fixed!    A nobody to Congress, like obama's journey,  remember America?!",

Which ironically republicans should support Scandinavia effort to remove the minimum wage and then you wonder why the average minimum wage (if it where set at all) still is above $10/hour.  Each private business makes a deal with councilars and the people rather than being FORCED to. And it may vary since private business can reject any proposal but still by a majority these companies are not fleeing scandinavian countries because of crushing taxes however you could argue scandinavia is too far to the left socially rather than economically.",
    "What an asshole! !!! We have a social conscience in Canada  as well as free enterprise.  You pick a South American country as your example.  You Americans don't get it, people help people who need help.  That's  Why a health care system, pension plans,  public housing, public education and public services are in effect.

    "Watters you are such a demagogue just like your bully and divider in chief. You are comparing the accomplishments of the US with 300 million people to Scandinavian counties who have a total of under 50? What kind of comparison is that? And Switzerland is actually a good  model to copy. And guess what? They have social democracy to a certain extent.  Social democracy works in most major european countries and in Canada as well. Why are you purposely misleading your viewers? Oh yes, you support a pathological liar so it's in your DNA. STOP WITH THE VENEZUELA COMPARISON!!!!! Are you nuts? You really think that's the aim and we can come like that???? Get real buddy. 60% of the population want it and Bernie Sanders is the most popular politician int he country. The rich need to pay more. That's how it works. So sad you are punting a false narrative. I feel so sorry for you guys. Open up your minds and you will see what most of the sane and reasonable people in the world have seen. Government is not all about the economy it's about people health. And that takes  a lot of different measures. People deserve a living wage. What's so wrong about that?",

    "The truth about socialism is that it is just a system where the government takes some level of central funding and control.\nFor example you could say that the US is a bit socialist because the army is not in private hands.\nI suppose the socialism of Norway, Denmark and some other European countries is probably the most successful model -  High wages, great healthcare, long holidays etc.\nThen there's the extreme socialism of total government control which usually fails - and fails big. This is the \nGutty of course, only wants you to consider the extreme form because he has an agenda to push.",
    "What socialist in Europe won't tell you. American taxpayers paid for European socialism.   After saving Europe twice during WW1 and WW2, we had to save Europe after Communist Russia rolled over Eastern and central Europe We had to retool for war, because we had basically disarmed.  The Europeans let us spend billions during the cold war while they spent their money on building a welfare state instead of defending themselves.",

Why are our elementary, middle, and high schools free? Should those all be paid for as well? How about we privatize everything if the government is so bad at its job...police, firefighters, libraries...or just get rid of government altogether and have a complete corporate State. What is that called? Corporatism? Since you are throwing fear-inducing words around, let's just call it what it is...Fascism.",
    "Joy Behar's excuse that socialism works is exactly Sweden and Norway.  She is so small minded that she is unable to distinguish the differences between our huge nation and their countries that literally contribute nothing to the betterment of the world.

We knew it wasn't right and we knew they were trying to rig it in some way but we called their bluff and we turned up in numbers never seen before in British history.

    "America and Japan need to confront China now.\n\nThere are many countries in the world that are taking serious abuses from the disgusting Chinese government officials.\n\nChina needs to stop polluting the earth.\n\nPresident Trump is doing a great job dealing with the crooked Chinese government officials.",
    "Why can't U.S. mind its own business? Paying student loans, bringing more jobs, paying debts to other countries, reforming healthcare, bridging ideological division in this country, rather than a disputed island 20000 miles away which has nothing to do with U.S. territory!!!!!",
    "A rationalist viewpoint on this matter. I am a moderate independent voter and a retired U.S. Army Master Sergeant (1972-1993) who voted for Trump. It is sad that China has elected to take an aggressive foreign policy stance almost identical to that of the Ultra-Nationalist Japanese government of the 1920-1930s, and one that will probably end eventually with the same tragic outcome of 1941-1945. Given this situation, my recommendation to President Trump would be to let the South Koreans and Japanese deal with this issue and stay out of it as long as free transit is allowed in the South China sea. After all those Chinese manmade islands they built, along with their expanded aggressive territorial claims, mainly pose a direct threat to both to Japan and South Korea, and not DIRECTLY to us at the current time. Except for nukes, the Japanese alone are more than a match militarily for China, if need be. Japan should be encouraged to develop nuclear weapons of their own and we should conclude an agreement with them similar to the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement which we made with the United Kingdom. This would restore the strategic balance of power in Asia and limit aggressive Chinese expansionism. At the current time China is the only Asian power with strategic nuclear forces and this has allowed them to intimidate their neighbors and do what they are doing. North Korea also wants to arm themselves, and pretty much for the same reasons - nuclear blackmail and extortion. The one thing China, and North Korea for that matter, fears more than anything else is a re-militarized Japan possessing strategic nuclear weapons of high accuracy. In conjunction with this recommendation we should withdraw ALL our military forces from both South Korea and Japan. Those countries are now more than capable of defending themselves and our DOD has known this for some years. Our own forces should be re-located to either bases in Australia, if they are willing, and/or our own territories. Australia, due to their much diminished current military capabilities and low relative population, are the only allied country in that region under potential real threat from China, as many Chinese strategic resources come from that country. My advice to the Chinese government is that it doesn't have to be this way, and you CAN choose a different path then one you are currently choosing. The ultra-nationalist path you are on now can only lead to the same tragic result Japan experienced in the 1940s. Is this truly what you want for your people? The United States and China should be the best of friends. We can learn much from each other. My advice to China would be to consider superpower status through science, the arts, space exploration and trade, rather than through aggressive ultra-nationalist expansionism.

    "Looking back in history, these islands are close to China, and Taiwan. After WW2, the US put those islands under Japanese administration, because they were afraid that when Taiwan would be defeated by the communists, everything would be communist. Actually, those Islands are situated 174 miles from Taiwan, and more than 1,000 miles  from Japans main island.\nI thought the US is a defender of the LAW of the Sea, as those islands are well within the 200 miles from Taiwanese economic zone, or do we have some double standards depending on who we have in front of us??",

    "China has made continued policy to treat other countries with civilized manner.  When Chinese representatives attended the event marking the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference recently, China reiterated the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries as enshrined in the UN Charter.  Most Chinese are disinterested in the debate about a new shifting of world power or power competition in the traditional sense which applied to the context of game theory.   It is on the demonize level to discuss that if China will become the dominant power in Asia because it is a Pseudo-proposition. The people who dressed in the garb of scholars to take Obfuscation and distortion for the reason to undermine and smear China, to instigate others to be the enemies to against China and to demonize China. \n       Ignorance makes people ignored the international law and blind to see the historical evidence of China's sovereignty over Diaoyo Dao and Taiwan.  The United States Government neglected the fact that United States Government has already long time ago conceded one China Policy. Taiwan has been part of China before today more than a thousand years ago, the sovereignty of Taiwan and Diaoyu Dao Inland can be found from international law.  Furthermore, according to the 1943 Potsdam Proclamation and Cairo Declaration, the Japanese sovereignty shall only be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and such minor islands as the then allies determined, including China.  As such, I recommend those so-called politicians who want to STEAL and dismantle the sovereignty\u00a0of China should know their former Government's principle and issues on the said preceding international law, Proclamation and Declaration.",

Further North Korea does not need intercontinental ballistic missiles to deliver a nuclear warhead on our soil.

    "Im glad to see that America has conservative economic thinkers on mainstream media, in an age of economic illiterate liberals.\n\nHigher taxes means that consumers and businesses have less money to save, spend and invest while the government just redistributes the tax revenue. When that guy mentioned the 'unseen' made me glad too, a homage to Bastiat, there's an opportunity cost when taken out of the private sector.\n\nGovt spending is not investing, its a tax. Printing money is a tax, taking on gov debt is a tax. If only  government spending was the key to prosper...thats what liberals and modern economists seem to think. The more expensive and liability from regulation people take on when starting a business then less will start businesses, employ people less and grow less.\n\nThe reparation tax is a good example, why does government want to prevent Multinationals from bringing their overs from overseas in the US? Thats not the intention behind the tax but thats the outcome. The opportunity cost of the tax is that the businesses invest and save their earnings overseas and not in the states. Yet government complains they do that. Just get rid of it and those over seas earnings get invested into the states.\n\nSavings and investing grows an economy. This is the fundamental backbone of economic growth. Diminish that and you diminish growth. Human action is the fundamental backbone of economics, but modern economists cant seem to grasp that either. If you have a system in place that disincentives investment, saving and starting businesses ect ect. then less people will. Its that simple.\n\nBut hey in a liberal world only an ideal is what matters, without regard for practicality. Thats socialism for you.\n\nSolutions:\nReduce taxes\nReduce Spending\nreduce size of government\nreduce private sector regulations\nstop printing money\npay off debts / stop taking on debt\nEducate economists and politicians you cant use the central bank to solve all your problems\nclose down central bank/prescibe rules if not closed down, to stop the boom and busts cycle",

Petraeus' small misconduct which far can't compare with his trimendous merits which he established up for our great country, he had much too big consequences for it, but our country may will suffer and loose much without him though.   The 1st Lady Clinton she mishandled the Binghazi tragedy, which cost 4 of our country's own patriotic deplomats' lives, she also accepted 26M dollars from unfriendly foreigners to jeopardize our country's own goodness, then those dangerous emails problems will even bring more problems for our country by her irresponsible and carelessness as well as ignored our country's own rules of the laws.  This is why I worry her iligibilities to even be allowed to run for the President.  However, I also believe that we should forgive her by our own generous mind of the forgiveness and appreciations for each other's services to our country.  President Clinton made mistakes, but overall he's still a good President.  Because she's our former President Clinton's wife and she's getting older and not very healthy.

    "Why is Juan always so negative?  Why does he have to show his hatred for our President every single day that he is in this program?  Even his dark face is so pathetic to look at - always angry, always arrogant!  One can express one's opinion in a nice way even if he disagrees with the rest of the group!   Could you not do that, Mr. Williams?   Your face will also look better, i suppose!",
    "It will be nice to finally find out what really happened on 9/11/2001. The NIST report is full of flaws. The people who lost their lives that day, and those who still mourn them, deserve the truth. There is a major report coming out soon. Those responsible for that horrific attack need to be exposed.",

Move the hell on, and soon. You are like children crying about your scoop of ice cream that fell off the cone, well after it melted and the ants have eaten it away. Get some help.",
    "This was a very civil program, except for Juan trashing Trump as soon as he felt Justified.  The idea of this program was saying,  \"We Came Together.\"  Now, let's bash Obama.  The belief in our strength and determination ended as soon as Obama entered the Oval Office.",
    "One thing people should remember is that the Dems/Progressives blamed US for the 9/11 attacks. The very politicians that implemented policies all over the planet, shamed the white male population for our policies caused the backlash that was 9/11. How ironic they let us forget that the \"we\" was the politicians, yet we, the public,\u00a0get to eat the \"shame\" served up upon ourselves, the public. Simple manipulation of the highest order for the sake of their agenda. I can't wait to see how they link 9/11 to Trump. The whole 9/11 wasn't just a one day affair. Dear old ALGore sold Al Jazeera a complete propaganda arm, aimed directly at the US and us, for a nice profit for himself. How interesting that most news agencies were under restrictions for foreign ownership in the US up until the time that ALGore decided he wanted to cash in once again at public expense. Just like the investment banking partners he is aligned with to peddle carbon credits to US companies to insure we add to his bank accounts at our expense. No wonder the Dems are totally pissed at Trump. He has delayed their carbon credit cash party for some time to come.",
    "My mother was dying, or thought to be in the process of that & had been moved to the dying rooms at the nursing home.  I had been there for the last 3 days.  She seemed to rally & drifted into a natural sleep about 5 am. I went home to call my sister & shower & change. They had 24 hours nurses on duty she gave me the promise if she detected the slightest change, she would call, i was 7 mins away, she seemed to be resting easier.  I dashed home, ,showered , called my sister to tell she should come, i just had a feeling , she was 9 hours away.  I checked with to nurse, she seemed improved & said she would call me so I grabbed a nap.   I put had the tv on , low sound. I sat  down on my bed & drifted off to sleep, the sound of the tv jarred me up.  I waken to a scene of an airplane  slamming into a sky scraper.  I immediately thought what a aweful show somebody had produced, I'm  definitely  ending my cable & turning tv off, I' m sick of all the bad programs & bad movies.  It is amazing how fast ideas can run through your head, seem like all at  once & all together. I was finishing dressing, the idea flashed in my head that looks like NYC & WHY would anyone produce a show using the twins towers, that getting too close to reality, we have enough bad in the world, we do not need this kind of programming. My full conscienceness hit me. I came fully awake, it was NYC Iran to the car & dashed to the nursing home.  My mother was a quiet woman who knew the declaration of independence by heart.  From about the age of three, she would recite it to me, she would recite the bill of rights, parts of the constitition  & other  works such as Poe's poem ,The Raven, so my civics education began early. We lived on an isolated large farm & ranch miles from people.  She & dad moved there right after my 2nd birthday.  My Dad had lied, went  into the service at nearly 15 yrs of age. He served 3 -2 YEAR hitches in the service in Panama.  After 2 hitches you could buy your way out of the service so for the price of a milkcow, ten chickens, a boar & 3 sows, (something along those lines) you could buy your discharge, a few weeks or  months into his fourth hitch, he did that, came home found work  married Mom & started down the traiil of life.  Owners of farm/ranches were looking for help with the winds of wars brewing, farming & ranching were better paying jobs & he hadn't been home in seven years. A bit of history  Dad was 22 & mom 20 when i was born. they were on t the bimg ranch when mom was 22.  In peak seasons, she cooked for 17 hired hands, wood stove, hand pump water .with a luxury sink near byv in the kitchen.  We did have a bathroom, well a toilet, most of the time until it would get too cold, no heat,drain the water can't have a broken pipe.  Mom baked bread, hand churned the butter & at times milked the two house cows, carried most of the kichen wood, killed the chickens unless she could bribe the men with a dessert.  When war was declared , farmers & ranches were frozen on their job, half of the crew left for the services, which increased the ones left duties & hours, so by the time i was 5, i was writing cursive, in order to keep me out of the way mom kept me busy at her kitchen table.  i had read every 1st thru 3rd grade school textbook, doing math due to a teacher aunt & my mom. Being raised by a patroit, I in knew in my soul what being an America mean, the  Pledgeof Allengence, the Star Spangled Banner, what you did to them & for them.   Mom's Dad was a first generation irish migrant. & Ellis Island where America could change you even your name. Mom would state over & over she hoped we never saw another world war.  One of her greatest fears!  Arriving at the nursing homeshe had not awaken.  I turned the tv off & ban it, in her home then stepped across the hall to a waiting area to find out the hideous truth.  Every face saw was reflecting the unthinkable horror that have never left us when you hear the words 9/11.  We are still dying because of those actions.  It tears a  piece out of your heart out, it's an injury that will not heal.  I threatened everyone & put a sign on her door, don't even whisper about the attack. My Mom needs to die in peace.   It never leaves us! We left the F/Ranch, but WWII was still on our minds, until the 3rd grade,  our gov't still worried about a counter attack over the Atom Bomber.  We practiced bomb drills for two more years  including sounds of low flying aircraft with bombs sounds.  Approximately two months after mom died i was walking outside, suddenly i was heard the sound of a low flying aircraft , I instantly dove  for cover, a near by air base having I think the B-2 plane began low flights to chart radar signal, i looked up as the plane came into view, this was 53 years later. I didn't even think what is that, I was lying there waiting for the bomb, I knew they were finally here, my knees were so weak, I couldn't stand for awhile.    God help all who lost love ones for all of us, please ease your & my pain.  My we show our appreciation by conducting ourselves morally & lawfully.   Help each others in their trials by helping others it help us to lift our sadness for a moment or two.  It's hard to love those who hates us  but there is another who will come to exact venegence for us. Remember Bengaza, Bless our heros who acted!  Shame to the leaders who failed them.   God bless our lost ones, protect our people who are currently in danger.  God bless our flag & our Country.     God bless our President, keep him  & his family safe.  Give us courage to identify our enemies &  courage to help him.  I'm amazed at God's grace & patience, frankly i couldn't do that, i would have already  said that's it, Nuke 'em all, I'm done with 'em!  Nite!",

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice answered when asked what the title of the 08/06/01 Presidential Daily Briefing was:  \"I believe the title was, 'Bin Laden determined to attack inside the United States.' \". That was a month before it happened. Bush did not go after Bin Laden before or even after 9/11. Obama did, -  successfully.",

Where the first winter at Plymouth Plantation was so severe that they had to bury their dead inside the compound so that the Indians would not know how few were left. Everyone had to be brave because they might lose their lives and this brought on more of a conviction of fighting the enemy.  This was also seen on the flight where the passengers rushed the enemy.

I do not and simply can not believe or accept the given story of 9/11. That dog don't hunt with me. My issue with President Trump is this: With him being the successful, well connected real estate mogul that he was in NYC back in 2001, and given his connection with Silverstein, I believe that it is not only possible, but probable, that Trump knew what Larry knew. The purchase of a newly instated $1 Billion per tower insurance policy makes Tom Hank's Zoltan look straight up amateurish.

In any event I challenge any of Trumps supporters, Trump attorneys, Hillary attorneys, Hillary, the media, or otherwise to a Socratic dialogue to counter my arguments.",

Jesus you are the author and finisher of all things, great and small. Jesus help us receive your perfect and perfecting love and forgiveness of the cross. Jesus you told me that if we could fully receive and understand the love and forgiveness of the cross, we would be transformed as a new spirit, a useful witness for Christ Jesus. Jesus we pray that you answer this prayer, that we receive THE FULL PORTION,of your perfect love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ.Jesus we praise your perfect love and forgiveness.

    "... (An Illegal Alien invasion pact - UN FORCED IMMIGRATION - which was going) to be signed during a meeting in Morocco in December 2018, a meeting which Israel (has now stated) will now not (be)attening. Israel will not sign a nonbinding, first-of-its-kind migration pact aimed at managing migration and making it more orderly and safe, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. \u201cI have instructed the Foreign Ministry to announce that Israel will not accede to, and will not sign, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWe are committed to guarding our borders against illegal migrants. This is what we have done, and this is what we will continue to do.\u201d The move comes after the US, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic have all said they will not be a part of the UN pact. Australia, Romania and Slovakia have also signaled that they may not join. A number of the Central European and Eastern European countries that have pulled out have governments that ran on planks of limiting migration, and have been at odds with Brussels over the EU\u2019s immigration policies. Israel\u2019s decision to withdraw comes even though Israeli foreign ministery officials took part in drawing up the pact, which grew out of the migration to Europe crisis in 2015, which saw the biggest influx of refugees and migrants since World War II. The pact is to be signed during a meeting in Morocco in December, a meeting that Israel will now not attend. Diplomatic sources said that a number of countries, including the US, Hungary and Austria, turned to Israel with requests to withdraw from the pact, but that the decision was made based on Israel\u2019s interests. \u201cThis agreement includes elements that are not in line with Israel\u2019s interests,\u201d one diplomatic official said. \u201cFor instance, family reunification for migrants. We are a small country in a very complicated geographic position. We are not like Germany, which can absorb a million people.\u201d US President Donald Trump, who has made stopping the flow of migrants to the US a core issue of his presidency, pulled Washington out of the pact in 2017, saying that it was not compatible with US sovereignty. He explained the US position at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York in September. \u201cWe recognize the right of every nation in this room to set its own immigration policy in accordance with its national interests, just as we ask other countries to respect our own right to do the same \u2013 which we are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is one reason the United States will not participate in the new Global Compact on Migration. Migration should not be governed by an international body unaccountable to our own citizens. Ultimately, the only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to help people build more hopeful futures in their home countries. Make their countries great again.\u201d The pact has been billed as an instrument to govern and manage migration around the world. The UN estimates that there are some 250 million migrants around the world. The pact deals with issues such as why people migrate, how to protect them, how to combat human trafficking, how to integrate the migrants into home countries, and what means can be used to return them home. Meretz MK Michal Rozin, former chairwoman of the Knesset\u2019s committee on foreign workers, blasted Netanyahu\u2019s decision, saying it \u201cis another example of the process of Israel\u2019s moral bankruptcy.\u201d\nShe said this is the \u201cresult of the prime minister joining with the extreme Right in Israel, Europe and the US. It cannot be that Israel \u2013 founded by many people who were refugees who fled murderous and cruel regimes, and which was among the leading countries in drafting the UN\u2019s Refugee Convention \u2013 will join with the forces of hatred, division and nationalism.\u201d\n\nThe jerusalem post\nIsrael News, 17:57 | 11/20/18\n\nIsrael joins U.S. and European countries in pulling out of migration pact\nBy HERB KEINON\n\n\n\nShare on facebook: Israel joins U.S. and European countries in pulling out of migration pact",

    "First of all, I'm not a \"party\" person. I personally do not believe in \"parties\". I am completely independent and vote for individuals and their policies. I think that party politics is what makes the government largely impotent and wasteful (no pun intended because they obviously are not that in the sexual sense of the term).  \n\nIn the Roy Moore case, I do lean a bit more to his side. The timing does seem a bit suspect and the fact that he ran for office so many times in the past and none of these ever came out? Unlike Bill Clinton and Horney Harvey, he also has no history of paying women off for sexual accusations. Do I think that this could be a political hit job? Hell yes! we've seen so many examples of dirty politics in the last year or so and neither side in Washington wanted him there even before this happened. I actually predicted that they were going to do something like this before the election. There are many people out there in America today that will do anything, including murder, in order to get their fifteen minutes of fame.  If there was more smoke from his past, I may be more likely to not support him.\n\nAnother thing that troubles me about this case is the hypocrisy coming from Congress. As we now know, there is a tax funded hush fund to pay off all the victims of the Congressmen's sexual urges and it's paid out millions so far. If we are going to find Judge Moore guilty without a hearing, then I want to know the names of all the Congressmen who the tax payers have paid for through this fund and any that remain need to step down immediately.  Al Franken, himself, is calling for an \"internal investigation\". Yeah, right! That's like putting the rats in charge off the cheese. According to these standards, Franken should step down immediately because of accusations. The ironic thing is that if Judge Moore was already seated and liked by his peers, he could avail himself of the hush fund and we would probably never hear about it. Even the democrats would protect him then.",

It seems like we do not have the free choice to vote for who we want to as it is our right. My mom was in the Army 23 years for the purpose of me and you having that right.  This show needs to be removed from the air. Anything like what happened in front of the world never needs to happen again. Anything that divides this country like they do needs to be removed from the public eyes and from view. Just my  Opinion",

She wears a PERMANENT SCOWL & her behavior is UTTERLY UNPROFESSIONAL, showing a BAD EXAMPLE on EVERY SINGLE SHOW, by gratuitously and disrespectfully referring to the President of the United States alternatively as \u201cthe guy in the White House\u201d, \u201cYou know who\u201d etc. She is supposed to lead by example and curb the any excesses of the other co-hosts (such as Barbara Walters would do). Her gutter behavior proves she\u2019s only fit to CLEAN THE TOILETS at ABC \u2013 she\u2019s no business being allowed to hang out with decent people. GET RID OF HER, FAST, please! P.S. I like her role in the movie \"Ghost\" when she HAD a waistline! I'm just saying. Nowadays, my stomach hurts a lot, after watching a Whoopi Goldberg flop ... OPPS! I meant \"flick\".",

It's all scripted for her part, she just has to steer the conversation to keep it within those parameters.",

Whoopie  responded to Pirro with her own medicine, not saying that was right, but Pirro's insults got her A** kicked (metaphorically).   Most times, just let people like Pirro talk give their opinion and move on.   Why does she have to whine on about it?  To keep the hate going on her show and in the country.  Says alot about her.  Let the hater's responses come forward.  I am ready.",

    "WHOOPI GOLDBERG IS A REPUBLICAN AND HAS BEEN FOR OVER 40 YEARS IDIOTS.  SHE HAS BEEN ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH CONSERVATIVE WHITE MEN SINCE THE 70'S FROM ALVIN MARTIN TO TED DANSON AND SHE DID NOT GET THEM FOR HER LOOKS THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SHE IS VERY INTELLIGENT. SHE DISLIKE TRUMP BECAUSE HE USE THE RACIAL CARD TO PUSH HIS POLITICAL AGENDA. THE JUDGE KNEW THIS.\nI am biased I care less about either side. The Judge attack Whoopi first and is mad because she went home and did not know what hole to poop out of her old one or the new one Whoopi ripped her.   Her new hole is still sore, so she is trying to get y\u2019all to help ease the pain by becoming the victim.  Y\u2019all should be tired of being people Lackeys you have been used since the Civil War wake up.\nAlways talking about the so called \u201cDeep State\u201d.  The Deep State is Israel the \u201cJews\u201d. Y\u2019all Dummies still think the Civil War was about Slavery. It was not it was about Lincoln wanted to borrow some money and the Jew Bankers wanted charge him 19% on the Dollar.  Lincoln said No and asked his Treasurer how much gold and silver we have in storage and told him to print that amount in paper money and issue it to the public. The Jew Bankers went down South and told y\u2019all Lazy Dummies Lincoln is getting ready to abolish slavery.  Y\u2019all lazy dummies pick up your guns and marched on Washington \u201cJew Puppets\u201d.  The Jews shot Lincoln in the head for being a Patriot.\n1913 a senator from Michigan Charles Lindbergh, y\u2019all know his son for flying around the world, caught them again for creating the Federal Reserve a private Jew Bank that can print money. The Jews was going to use the money to start WWI and WWII to so that they can get Israel. Read the Balfour Declaration it is all in there, before Lindbergh could get enough support to stop it he was shot in the head a common theme.\n1960s A young tough smart man became President.  HIs name was John F. Kennedy caught them again. He said they are trying to make slaves out of the American People and drafted Executive Order 11110, in which would give the power of printing money back to the Treasurer and terminated The Federal Reserve. Before he could sign it, he was shot in the head. The Jews hire 5 hitmen from Sicily to do the job they never were caught.\n1976 A Patriot President was elected Jimmy Carter.  He found out that we have been giving the State of Israel $5000000 a year in aid since 1948 and he was going to stop it because he knew they were fake and should have never been giving that land. The Jews created the The Iran Hostage situation, in which made Iran what it is today to discredit Mr. Carter so that they could install there on President.\n1980-2016 America has all Jewish Presidents, y\u2019all saying wait Obama is a Muslim. Heck NO!!! he is an Orthodox Jew you forget about his mother she is from a powerful Jewish Banking family. He was born in Queens New York, oh y\u2019all savior Trump knew he didn\u2019t tell you he found Obama birth certificate.  Trump know Obama real name too.\nNow getting back to subject people get mad when Trump supporters talk about Trump. People get mad at y\u2019all dummies being used by someone playing the race card to get the so called \u201cDeep State\u201d agenda done for them since the Civil War then use reverse psychology to make it seems like the Patriots are \u201cDeep State\u201d.  When Trump met with Putin in Helsinki before Putin Climax in his mouth Trump said could you please help keep \u201cIsrael Safe\u201d that is the main thing is to keep \u201cIsrael Safe\u201d now you can ejaculate in my mouth. Go back in look at the video he did not said keep \u201cAmerica Safe\u201d he said \u201cIsrael\u201d stop being idiots for the Jews and start listening to what people say and do.",

Clearly these hate protests and speeches are becoming a threat to our countries peace! Thank you Judge Jeanine for your steadfast bravery of speaking the truth! God bless you!

    "Putting this episode to bed sounds like let's put this war in Korea to an end in 1953. Figuratively of course, meaning that all what happened with Jeanine and Goldberg was a division at the Korean border that may yet may be a tragic reflection of who in this divisive country may be who we are. Koreans didn't choose this. Maybe we are when you see this hysterical, know matter what he does, President Trump hatred that could make us if not already look like a divided country into one. Whoopie Goldberg and her ilk of leftist prefer that. If this country were to be divided, let the Democrats and their leftist voters live in the land that they voted or rioted to make that \"utopia?\"",

    "Sorry Judge, Whoopi isn't getting a pass from me. Maybe you had to make nice so that it doesn't have a long term negative impact on your career, but I will never forgive her behavior. This is the last straw. She is rude, arrogant, hypocritical and judgmental. She tries to silence free speech at any chance she gets. She needs to be terminated from The View. Elisabeth would never have put up with that stunt, but her co-hosts, including Meghan McCain were cowering in their seats. There is no longer a real conservative voice on that show. I don't know why any conservative would ever go on. You said that you would go on again. If you do, let me put it plainly, it would be a stupid decision. You can move on and give respect, but you don't have to put yourself in the middle of a firing squad.

    "I am trying to retype my thoughts as Google or YouTube just dumped my lengthy post to you Judge Jeanine, as I was wrapping it up. First I need to say I of course I \"know\"  neither you women, Judge or Goldberg. What I have seen of you both on camera leads me to fully love our Judge, and the actions of Goldberg on the \"VIEW\" only cements what thoughts I have had of Goldberg. I prefer to think of Goldberg in movies like the SISTER ACT's and GHOST, which will remain one of my all-time favorites.  Now, the cat fight that was on the \"VIEW\" was certainly expected, knowing what I know of both women's views. Whatever happened off stage, only can be surmised, but I am sure both women were saying words that would not be allowed on air. To that end, everyone is/was aware of the differ views of the \"VIEW\" and \"FNC\" (Judge Jeanine, not sure totally about \"21st Century Fox\", as of the moment)). The \"VIEW\" is very much liberal and democratic in their views, showing a bias that leans to tearing AMERICA apart. Anyone that appears on the \"VIEW\" should know is, or is leaning to not seeing, hearing, or speaking no EVIL. Make no mistake about it the country is being divided everyday, brother against brother and sister against sister, pitting GOOD against EVIL, the classic \"CIVIL WAR\" and has been played out time and time again since Cain and Able.  Civility has been lost and we can lon longer just put this all behind us, Judge (I am sure you do know this). It will get worse before we are ever closer to healing this once Great Nation. It is past time that we all should be on our knees and praying and seeking were our hearts lie. If you are not sure then I urge everyone that sees this post to lean to the side of GOOD, the side that thinks of others and not your personal desires. If you can not, well then we are truly in a state of civil war a war of GOOD vs Evil. I truly hope that Both women get to see this post.  I pray for you both, I also pray for the people at FNC, and as always I pray for our Country and for the men and women, that fight everyday to protect her and all of us, no matter which side we may lie in the struggle of GOOD and EVIL.  ~Andy  Jul 22, 2018.",

She called herself a Christian nd then uses language only fit for a sailor !!!!",
    "Wow she nailed it! Whoopi was giving her a back handed compliment and she gave it right back to her with the truth! Whoopi was once loved by me and many people but wen she got on the view it didn\u2019t take long to see that anyone with a different political view than hers was thought of as garbage and not human.",
    "I only watch the view when someone I know is going to be on or when there is something really outrageous happens.  Knowing that you are friends with Whoopi does put a whole new spin on the incident.  The thing is, Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) is a real thing and I cannot even talk about politics with some of my family and friends, because of it.  I though it was bad when Bush Derangement was happening, but WOW, the TDS is strong in some people. Maybe if they reined in their imaginations about the outrageous things pundits are saying  and learn truth they will stil not like Trump as a person, but at least agree he is doing some very good things for our country. Thanks for all you do Judge!  We need more like you.",
    "wooopy can leave the country as she said she would, and take your view with you. you don't like trump, then leave please, I can not stand the uglyiest black racist I have ever seen. go leave. get the hell out of my country.. TRUMP IN 2020..",
    "That's the mature thing to do and everyone needs to agree to disagree, no one has a right to try and force you to think the way they do.  I still do not watch the view because it's a horrible show.  Those women are angry and mean.  And I still think and will continue to do so think they set the judge up and I really do not know how they get anybody to be on it.  Move forward.",
    "Judge Jeanine is a bum.. move on. You lied.. the audience didn't side you and you did says some less than classy words. The cheap shot at the end of this video though? How original. We all know you are so far up Trump's behind that you are gassed up from all the BS.",

And Joy Behar..\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd2e they're both sick twisted individuals it baffles me that show is still in existence and how they get people in the audience that clap at everything they say..they must have some Applause sign that lights up or some like-minded sickos that gather there. I honestly thought that show was off the air up until about a year ago LOL I even thought Whoopi was fired hahaha she should be fired and for her to say she never does that? That's all she ever does is get mad and yell at her guess that she doesn't agree with and also walk off the set. How many times has she done this now? I've never heard of her cussing at someone offset and kicking them off their premises what a heinous woman she's disgusting!",
    "On another note. President trump brings some hope to me. I hope it gets better for America and its people if not well ,they can create all the jobs they want . People will not work those jobs anymore because so many see the uselessness of a job. Especially if it doesn't make much difference in their lives. So they will eventually wake up all due to the fact we've been used and abused for too long. It's time to take back our lives and our government.   And why work if our SSI income has been stolen.  And given to Afghans Iraqis and the rest of the world. Omg I'm just disgusted with it all.",

    "The Judge is a professional with an informed, rational and sensible presentation. Whoopi is an out of control, emotional liberal that can't hold a civil converstion with anyone that doesn't agree with her. She's typical of all liberals. She should be fired from The View. Viewers should boycott the show. Is Whoopi immune from consequences because of her celebrity status? That wouldn't surprise me. Let's see if the producers of The View take action.",
    "Whoopi is just insecure and jealous that she is nothing.  Look up her history.  She was a slut who slept around, had multiple abortions, and lived off of welfare too long.  She probably got her big break by doing sexual favors to a certain producer.  What has she really accomplished???",
    "I've don't watch any show aimed at lonely, fat selfish couch taters. Oprah created the 'It's ok to be a victim and blame the world' syndrome, a mindset that has given whoopie and joy a platform. For stable, secure Adults, we rarely find a need for programming as the View. Judge, that was not your audience, and u knew that!

On the view I watch you on hannity june202018. Never once  through  a fit ask people who didnt agree with to say I done its over get her out of their swearing an carrying on . That was they say day you went on the view that you did haninity world of difference . Brush the dust off your feet. You can hold your own...dont through your pearls before swines they will trample upon them.",

    "Thats what people that know they lost or will lose the argument do , scream over you and dont let you talk and in the end f-bomb you. Whoopi is a loser and she know she would have lost the argument if she would have let the judge talk , so the only way to save face is becoming unhinged and get a reason to end the show.",
    "Whoopi is just searching for ways to extend her very long career as a comedian and actress.  She is always just playing a part for $$$.  That\u2019s what she does and nothing more.  If race baiting makes her money that\u2019s what she does, she gives no thanks to the people or the country that made her very rich.   No gratitude at all...",

It's easy to seed hate and vitriol on your show but not so easy in front of people who know better. Shame on you Pirro and shame on Fox for promoting such demagoguery.

    "\"Mass movements begin with a widespread \"desire for change\" from discontented people who place their \"locus of control\" outside their power and who also have no confidence in existing culture or traditions. Feeling their lives are \"irredeemably spoiled\" and believing their is no hope for advancement or satisfaction as an individual they seek \"self renunciation\". Such people are ripe to participate in a movement that offers the option of subsuming their individual lives to a larger collective. The \"new poor\" are the most likely converts for any mass movements, for they recall their former wealth with resentment and blame others for their current misfortunes. Racial and religious minorities, particularly those only partially assimilated into mainstream culture are also found in mass movements. \"Misfits\" such as the \"chronically bored\", the talentless, and criminals are all ripe for the picking of a mass movement. An individual's goals are unimportant. Rather the mass movement's \"chief preoccupation is to foster, perfect and perpetuate a facility for self sacrifice\". Mass movements demand a \"total surrender of a distinct self\". One identifies the most as a certain memeber of a tribe or family. Every person's persona and life must ultimately come from their identification with the larger community, even when alone they must never feel isolated and unwatched. Hoffer identifies the communal sensibility as the reemergence of a \"primitive state of being\"\u00a0 common among premodern culture. While mass movements idealize the past and glorify the future, their present world is denigrated\" Successful mass movement must not believe in a god, but they must believe in a devil. Hatred unifies the true believers in the mass movement. The hatred of the convert is masked in self loathing, as with the condemnation of capitalism by socialists while Russia under the Bolsheviks saw more intensive monopolization of the economy than any other nation in history. The fanatic is perpetually incomplete and insecure, and thus uses uncompromising action and personal sacrifice to give meaning to their life. - Eric Hoffer(The True Believer 1951)\n\nSHALL I CONTINUE?

A man that doesn't know what it is like to live from one paycheck to the next. His opinion is irrelevant in today's day and age. He should go back to his pampered retirement and remain out of sight and sound.",

Chris Matthews and Rachel Maddow are acting like raving lunatics .. but Koppel has nothing to say about them? Keith Olbermann is so far to the left that reality is a dim light in the distance .. but Koppel picks on Sean? The media has raised Dr. Phil to be the leading voice for the discipline of psychology; The View is considered to be a panel of experts; and Geraldo Rivera and Chuck Schumer are in the headlines every single day for doing nothing but preening,  prattling and showboating .. and Koppel choses to pick on Bill and Sean????",

    "Koppel has 50 years of experience with little to zero blemishes regarding his journalist history. The man is a legend and respected by his peers.

This is tearing our country apart.  Every time I turn on my T.V., computer, cell phone or read a newspaper, I am exhausted with left and right arguments and attacks towards each ideology.  This madness has consumed network television and journalism.\n\nBravo Mr. Koppel.

This is pure mudslinging from the left..now trying to discredit Fox and Hannity because Fox is the number one news network and Sean Hannity says it like it is!\nHannity just got a taste of what theyve been doing to Trump all along. \nLeft Fake News people are a bunch of slimeballs.

Its fine that we are a bunch of dummies but that puts a huge responsibility on the yellers to not damage this fragile framework we call society. Look at us now. Half the country hates the other half but we all think we are smart. Ted Koppel comes from a time when the newsmen understood that people were dummies and they presented the news in a dull but fairly objective way to inform us but not to incite hatred of their enemies.",

Facts are dry and boring. \n\n2.

It has everything to do with the complete nuttiness you see on the right these days.",

    "That's because Bill you do not bother to tell everything, you just put part of it up then make a commentary that is not true. Like the census, you went all nuts saying illegal aliens are counted in the census.  You never bothered to look into the truth, the truth is no one counted in the census has ever been asked if they are a citizen and as a matter of fact if you are a citizen living overseas you are not counted. It has always been that way, but you drummed up such hatred about the census almost everyone I encountered was hostile, and as a matter of fact a woman census taker was beaten up so badly she had to be hospitalized. Your fucking stupidity and half ass reporting created problems. Fox News, for the most part, does not give a shit about facts.",

This means all media like traditional papers, far right and far left sources such as Breitbart, Fox, Rush and MSNBC, CNN, TYT. Regardless of whether you are for the right or left your hatred toward news sources that don't align with your partisan leanings will be prevalent in such a poll. What we as Americans, hell humankind, need are facts not your opinions, rants or your spin on the facts. No alternative facts but real quantifiable facts!! This bs that Trump or Clinton like pundits put out there are not facts but alternative facts. We need politicians and media that only provide truths and need to support these claims with evidence that is factual. Simple but so hard for so many in media because they let greed like profits push their narratives in order to sensationalize and get ratings, clicks and advertisers money.

    "Wrong Noah, people don't want to hear good things about their choice, they want to hear the truth from an unbiased source so that the electorate can make an educated decision as to who is truly fit to run this country.  Sorkin had it right when he made The Newsroom - \"nothing is more important to a democracy than a well-informed electorate\".\n\nAnd I also wish these two quotes were taken to heart as well: \n\n\"In the infancy of mass communications, the Columbus and Magellan of broadcast journalism, William Paley and David Sarnoff, went down to Washington to cut a deal with Congress. Congress would allow the fledgling networks free use of taxpayer-owned airwaves in exchange for one public service. That public service would be one hour of air time set aside every night for informational broadcasting, or what we now call the evening news. Congress, unable to anticipate the enormous capacity television would have to deliver consumers to advertisers, failed to include in its deal the one requirement that would have changed our national discourse immeasurably for the better. Congress forgot to add that under no circumstances could there be paid advertising during informational broadcasting. They forgot to say that taxpayers will give you the airwaves for free and for 23 hours a day you should make a profit, but for one hour a night you work for us.\"\n\n\"We'll endeavor to put information in a broader context because we know that very little news is born at the moment it comes across our wire. We'll be the champion of facts and the mortal enemy of innuendo, speculation, hyperbole, and nonsense. We're not waiters in a restaurant serving you the stories you asked for just the way you like them prepared. Nor are we computers dispensing only the facts because news is only useful in the context of humanity. I'll make no effort to subdue my personal opinions. I will make every effort to expose you to informed opinions that are different from my own.\"\n\nOur lives and our country would be so much better off if the above were truly applied to the MSM.",
    "I can tell you why we don't trust the media. It is not because of Trump. It is because of the over hundred years of deceptions and propaganda you played for the establishment elite and the role you play in dumbing us down so we can't think critically and make our on mind. Because a thinking and educated citizens are a danger to the political Elites. There is no free press! You all are owned by five corporation and most of you are the member of CFR.

    "With all due respect, Noah (although I am sorely tempted not to use any), that is your OPINION that you just stated as fact. Another reason Republican trust in the media has fallen dramatically could very well be because of the sycophantic bias they have shown in this election. Go ahead and tell me how many Republicans can watch any television outlet other than Fox without wanting to puke. That's were you get your answers. At least Fox gives two sides of issues, and you can see they are divided. All the others are pro-Clinton all the way.",

The Arabs, Islamic or not, and Rome kept this mandate in place, til the British drew up a partial plan with the Arabs called the Oslo agreement. To this date, the Bedouin people who worked in and lived in Israel, (which was renamed by Rome: Palestia,) used the world's modern, political democracy to leverage that Roman mandate, into this century. This disconnected, non-progressed people, calling themselves \"Palestinians occupied\", give away that they support and have that Roman mandate in their claim to the land; preceding any recognition of Israel today! Who they are and how they came to be matter's not; as these represent the Arab League of Nations in their stance that Israel must not step foot in Israel, or remain there ever. That is why there will never be a 2 State, or peace solution; that is, unless this mandate can be lifted and shown illegal; along with its middle eastern front of jihad, with its terror support system. Those who will not recognize God's hand in this will without reprieve, suffer, the wrath of our creator, when they are brought low by the truth. Pray for the peace of Israel is not a plea, but a declaration. Trump will leverage the mandate that the Pope of Rome keeps in place, obstructing the law of the land that enforces \"thou shalt not kill, or steal\"; to remove that mandate.

REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT WORKING CLASS PEOPLE ARE MORALLY WEAK.\r\n\r\n If you are someone who has yet to reach the middle class, there are fundamental philosophical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as to why that has yet to happen. The Republican philosophy is all about rugged individualism. To a Republican, if you are not rich, it is completely your own fault. Republicans believe that people who do not achieve upward mobility have character flaws. Democrats hold the opposite philosophy. \r\n When Republican politicians talk to working class people, they think they are talking to people who are morally weak. Listen to them. They admit it. Rugged Individualism is the Republican Philosophy. The rich deserve to be rich because they are morally superior. This BS is old. Kings believed this stuff. Republicans count on Political Illiteracy. Please learn your political Left vs Right. We are not all in the same boat. The Democratic Left is on the side of working people, not the Republican Right. Workers go on the Left. Republican Billionaire Bankers go on the Right. This is not just a theory anymore. History does not lie. We have the hard data to prove it.",
    "Under Trump and his drastic tax cuts the U.S. deficit is exploding.\nFirst and foremost large companies companies benefit from the tax cuts, not the people with small incomes.\nDue to Trump\u2019s sanctions against China, U.S. cars sales there are currently going way down.\nThe U.S. are an nation of immigrants, open for people to pursue their dreams.

He courted the dictator of North Korea, describing him as \u201efunny and with great sense of humor\u201c (!)

    "I'm SO glad the President talked about our vets! And he is EXACTLY RIGHT!  My stepfather was a vet who got sick. The VA hospital in Phoenix told him it would be weeks before he could be seen. He already had a VERY serious medical condition that he got in the military. And he couldn't sue because you sign away that right when you see a military physician. He finally got in after a huge wait and a 5 min.convo. with the dr. He had a cold. He was given cough syrup and sent home. This happened three times over the course of months. He wanted to see a local dr. instead of driving almost 200 miles. While on a medical pump. He ended up in the ER because his chest pain got too bad. He was air flighted from AZ to San Diego, went into cardiac arrest  and died. I found out later that in all of his visits they didn't once run a single x-ray! He had, had pneumonia!!!  My Mom had been his caregiver and was having stomach trouble. She was finally able to see a dr about a month after my stepfather died. They did run tests on her. Only to find that she had colon cancer. They said she needed surgery which she did. They told her in the month she had to wait( which was very fast for the VA) it had spread, And she was terminal. They gave her 3 yrs and started chemo to extend her life as long as possible. They hoped the chemo would give her time on top of the 3 yrs. Instead she was dead in less than 3 months!!! SHe tried to get in to see her dr but they made everyone's appts. months in advance! This VA hospital was then ALL OVER THE NEWS for their poor care and neglect! So yes THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT!",

    "From the literary point of view, we could perceive another influence in Trump's speech. There are elements that suggest an application of what Bertrand Russell, in a talk on the BBC, called Emotive Conjugation. It is this grammatical curiosity in the variation of the verb, not according to time or mode, but according to the person. Russell's example is clear: \"I'm persistent, you have strong ideas, he's a hard-headed stubborn.\" It's a typical case in which the same action suffers from variations because of the person. And if Trump's linguistic subtlety allows him to know this process and combine \"Michael Cohen is a compulsive liar, Trump generates alternating facts,\" on the other hand, this would be a foreign influence that would not be allowed in such a patriotically fundamentalist speech with Tea Party trademarks , this fanatical zeal that wants to impose the evangelical \"Sharia\". Make no mistake, the Law and unconstitutionalities perpetrated by Trump, are illegal whether he is a con artist or a lying President!

All this is considered \"peaceful protesting\" yeah ok. Well, I will promise you all this. If I happen to come to a road block with you idiots being the ones blocking the road I will get through it even if I have to run you over, then I will hook up a chain to whatever piece of shit is blocking the road and drag it out of the way so everyone else can get through. If I have to shoot and kill a person to protect myself, family or anyone else that you decide to go after I will shoot to kill and not feel any remorse. Even if your black, I will be automatically labeled a racist but I will be alive and you will be dead. If you fuckers decide to riot, burn or rob businesses in my town and I will take out as many of you as I can without casualties unless I have to. This is a fair warning. I hope that many of you with common sense will do the same and put a stop to all this nonsense and left wing bullshit because it's our fault that we have allowed it to get to this point. We have let them rule, we don't fight back, it's time to put an end this and get this country back where it's supposed to be.

Just in published cell video, three different types of arms sounds audible, different tone, rates of fire. Then there's the paramilitary guys, one with a mohawk haircut,  guarding a guy walking through a different nearby hotel, in addition to reports of arms fire at other locations.

Because Trump was hot on the heels with his \"calm before the storm\". Paddock (which means a field for livestock) and he did favors for Obama and was provided planes by Obama. He also provided Children to the Bohemian grove right at a permanent place right on the premises. The FBI had a big problem to not tie themselves with him, yet they needed him gone. They planned to poison him, and also to create another gun control scenario. They killed him and Danly, then broke out some windows. Sent their teams and helicopters to create maximum chaos with their pre-planned strike. You have never actually seen Danly nor did you \"actually\" see her being wheel chaired into the airport.  They de-coupled themselves from Paddock, created an scenario where nobody would make the connection. Got another gun-control false flag out of it. And killed a bunch of Trumpers as a bonus.

HOWEVER, it is entirely possible that a few key people were 'on the inside' of making certain the weapons always safey accompanied Paddock to whichever room he might be staying in. it has been said that this is not the FIRST 'arms deal' that took place out of THAT hotel with PADDOCK's involvement.

If the answer to that is yes, then someone, the author has spoken to you. I know that this is a concept that is very difficult for you to understand but bear with me. If I read something in the Bible that Christ supposedly said and I believe he did and I remember it in my effort to solve some of my daily problems, then Christ did in fact speak to me through the word that was written so many hundreds of years ago and gave answers to problems that I might have today. \n         God's word is not only written in a book but it is also written in nature. That what is it written in nature in my view of course is the true word of God. It cannot be changed it is what it is. So wherever there may be a discrepancy in that book I would say that you should compare it to what is in nature then perhaps the real real truth can be known.  I am not saying that nature is God please don't misunderstand me on that issue. It is God speaking to us through nature just like an author speaks to us through written word in a book.

He orders another attack and the killing of all the living creatures of the city: men and women, young, and old, as well as oxen sheep, and asses (Joshua 6).  In Judges 21 He orders the murder of all the people of Jabesh-gilead, except for the virgin girls who were taken to be forcibly raped and married. When they wanted more virgins, God told them to hide alongside the road and when they saw a girl they liked, kidnap her and forcibly rape her and make her your wife!\n\nJust about every other page in the Old Testament has  God killing somebody!  In 2 Kings 10:18-27, God orders the murder of all the worshipers of a different god in their very own church!

    "From her perspective, that would be considered mental illness. However from a Christian perspective it\u2019s called knowing God. Also her comment is off because you can\u2019t just say that someone is automatically mentally ill because they convert to Christianity (no one is born a Christian, but they choose to be one). Honestly what she said is nothing new, she\u2019s just ignorant. And I\u2019m not saying that as an insult toward her, but she is ignorant of what we believe. I also think that her comment was shaped around a person that hasn\u2019t had our nations best interest at heart. I would question mike pence. Just because someone says they\u2019re hearing from God that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. This is coming from a Christian telling others to be very careful about who they listen to or what they believe. (That advice is applicable to everyone actually). But also as a Christian, I wouldn\u2019t listen to the advice of a non Christian regarding how to live or view my faith. I\u2019m really more interested in sharing truth than boycotting her even though what she said was pretty harmful and bigoted",

Joan of Arc was burned alive because she claimed that God spoke to her. RELIGIOUS people fired her up, tied to a stake.   Considering the things Mike Pence says, like Joy, I think he is listening to his own internal  insecurities babbling endlessly in his mind.  Many who claim to speak with \"God\" are morally bankrupt opportunists seeking fame, cash and  sex. I suspect that, like Mike Pences hair, his brain is very carefully focused on keeping himself from being out of control.  He can't even trust himself to be in the same room as another woman without his wife or other witnesses to keep him from temptation.   Does that sound like a well-adjusted Christian?",

    "Hearing voices does not always equate to mental illness.  It certainly is a sign though.  I don't believe that Mike Pence is mentally ill because he hears the voice of a god.  Mike Pence is however delusional when it comes to this specific claim.  He is not hearing a God's voice! It's all in his head and maybe it makes him feel safe, valued, important, special, and vindicated.  I love to be on the sidelines as people of various religions claim to hear voices of \"god\" and the blatant contradictory things he/she/it tells them from one person to the next.  Also....the hypocrisy of the voice hearers......as they would be concerned about non god voices claimed by others or voices of other God's they don't believe exist.  I would love a diagram from these people to tell me which voices are ok and which are mental illness.  Religion and god certainly help people feel comforted and important....some may hear voices to perpetuate the fantasy out of desire or other emotional need.  Yes some are mentally ill......however the vast majority are just wrong and kidding themselves and are otherwise mentally fit.  Joy did not insult anyone with this statement...she made a statement of truth..one that is simply false. People are by and large insulted by her ignorance and for those that hear voices of God's/godessess....may be afraid to confront the reality that it is just in their head and there is no one looking after them.",

There's ENOUGH Attacks going on in the world WITHOUT Derrogatory Remarks such as theirs!!  And so the LAST thing Our churches need are the likes of, Not to mention Behars Very 'Public' Remarks!  Yes Dangerous.  Hurtful.  WRONG.  Sad.  Lastly, it seems that Behar's Only statements when taken to task is the Same.. \"It was a JOKE.\" Well, She's a Joke, and so is that entire so-called show, the View.  Just tells me How Desperate ABC is to keep them on air.  How Creative are you ABC?  Can't think of Anything else??  They're All Dispicable.

I would say she's a well rounded Christian in ways Pence and his small container of love and compassion will ever know. It doesn't go unnoticed that Pence has chosen to wholeheartedly protect and defend the one part of Gods creation that is so conveniently nonexistent.",
    "We all know the only reason Joy said that comment was because she wanted to smear Pence due to Pence being associated with Trump - and the way she decided to smear him was using his religion. I'm not religious, but comparing Christianity to a mental illness is very disrespectful, ridiculous, and petty. I hope everyone calls ABC and complains until that hateful woman is fired.",

    "With the blessing of Google a person can now do much more research into the history of faith.  MUCH of the Biblical writings were passed down from the Summarians such as the story of  Gilgamesh.  And much has come from the ancient Egyptian mystery schools.  The 10 Commendments were influenced by the Egyptian Book of the Dead.   The Bible as we know it came from the Council of Nicea 325AD and was strongly used as propaganda for Constantine's rule over the Holy Roman Empire.  Constantine, himself was a Druid.  That is not to say that the Bible writings are wrong.  Evidently a faith that lasts from one civilization to the next is based on truth.  However, this bickering over who is right and who is wrong needs to grow up.",

They have forums where they say Christ was a communist, a homosexual a transexual, you name it they claim Jesus was it.

Hell, when I was in college I would have loved to have had a factory job. The bottom line is people seem to be forgetting this was corporate Americas fault just as much as it was governments fault. Now what you have are American born companies overseas buying out our politicians to rig our fucking elections and they have the nerve to call their bribery soft shit like \"lobbying\" and \"special interest.\" It's fucking bribery. Just call it what it is. They use this soft language to define their rigged system  to the best of their abilities. They have been doing this for 50 years now and it's gotten so bad they can't even hide their bullshit anymore. Their entire existence is PC b/c that is all they know now.

    "Most of us are brainwashed from watching to many bias documentaries and CNN. Logic tells us we need to get control of this. We are compassionate people as a country, so we should help people that want to be citizens and pay full taxes and not just sales tax on things they buy. If we did give them a path to citizenship so they can pay taxes it would help the country right now. There would be more competition for the jobs as well because everyone would have an equal chance. Right now American citizens are at a disadvantage because they can't work for as low as wages because they have all the taxes to support the illigal people. I know this will bring some bad comments, but respond with something we can talk about and not just a bunch of rage and hatred. We are more in debt now than ever, in our history as a country. We do have to get the people that don't want to contribute out and the ones that want to embrace this country and make it better in. I know there are many illegal people who like this country more than some of the citizens, and they are who we need to keep. Donald has a his thoughts in the right place but might be going a little overboard, but if you look at the other side, they are going to far the other way and trying to give away all of our money.

They say he's flip flopped from \"mass deportation\" to \"select deportation\" except... He's never said he wants to do \"mass deportation of mexicans\" as commenters said he's mentioned many times he wants to deport them, and how he's not released until now.

The main tenet of his immigration policy is the same- secure the border and get rid of the criminal illegals first. He always said that. Now offering some path for those here for decades is humane. Him choosing to listen to the public isn't a bad thing either. Now all you haters can't say he will be a dictator. He is running for the Presidency to meet the needs of the people not to shove his personal feelings down everyone's throat. He wanted the wall built and many people still do so the wall will be built. Many people on both the democrat and republican side  want some pathway so I think it speaks to his\ncharacter that he listened.

He WILL STILL build the wall (to keep any further illegals from entering) REMOVE the illegal CRIMINALS NOW, then start working toward a soulition for those that are here, but safe to our communities. Which doesn't say to me he intends on keeping them here per say, but rather figuring out a way to handle this situation in a human way. After all we are a country that welcomes new citizens under law. That's what has been missing here on illegal immigration...LAW. He will come into office and have to fix genarations of problems our country has suffered and our government has ALLOWED! I think his SLIGHT variation on his original plan shows growth and leadership! Listening to other views when needed. Remember, he has met with boarder patrol, law enforcement, leading members of Hispanic groups. He is listening! He is listening to what our country needs to become safe and prosperpus. He will handle the issue of possible terrorists entering into this country, he will handle the crisis of our economy, which will INCLUDE abuuse of our government programs. I don't understand why there is \"back talk\" with this? Hillary's plan for us is the complete opposite. She will change NOTHING, except allow MORE illegal's into our country from all over the world, she wants MORE government programs, and she really doesn't view ISIS as a threat.

The only class in this act is sitting in the position of POTUS right here and now, Donald Trump! And his soul and integrity are intact! It's non-negotiable. A lot of Washington swamp scum have offered to to buy out his integrity etc., but Trump isn't selling. You people, LGBT, Anti Americans, Liberals, Communists, ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter, Liberals, Democrats, Anarchists, KKK, White Lives Matter, Neo Nazis etc. are trying to destroy rule of law, and amputate the spirit of America, you want to execute the very soul of true Americans and Patriots and bring this country down to your level of thinking, living and decadence. And why? Because Trump wants to enforce the law of the land and make America Great. Well, Bill, Barrack, Hillary, and all you anti-Americans and other political, anti-american, hate mongering entities wherever you are right now, just accept the man.

The seeds of dissent he has sown over the past 8 years of his Presidency are more evident now than ever perceived or imagined, Mission Accomplished! He is the one single reason why this country is so divided now. Even now he cannot stay out of the political picture, keeps sowing dissent and trying to keep America divided. He is a mouth piece, the great Orator, he has hate for America, hate and disgust and contempt for his own family, deeply rooted, I truly think he he would more than love to see America weakened and divided, just as he is himself. He has been experiencing an identity crisis for quiet sometime, mostly rooted in his upbringing, a mixture of communist/democratic ideological messages, mix of black/white/ethnicity and conflicting religious conviction (Muslim/Christian) influences and a sexual identity crisis which has been going on for sometime now. This I would say makes him more likely the Devils Advocate. He was and always will be the President who accomplished nothing, who always straddled the fence (or something else)!

There's a very good reason the majority of Trump's support base is primarily under educated white males on their racist pity pots.

    "Who cares what this conman liar has to say about Obama. Obama is a dignified decent man while trump is a thief a con artist and a consummate pathological compulsive liar. On important matters and on dumb shit. One is a giant of a man the other is a spoiled brat bully and cry baby. The difference is vast. Trump could never no matter how hard he tried bring his rotten despicable diaper breath character to the character place and fix his loathsome repulsive reprobate self into a sliver of what Obama is. He's not capable of decency or honesty and his Hate and contempt of others doesn't allow him to change. He's actually the worst American in the country and some huge group of people weren't able to discern that the worst Person in USAland was not someone you want in the Oval office. This consortium of defective people were unable to see that the Democrat was , on a scale of 1 to 100 , the Democrat is an 11 while this piece of fuck trump is a 99 possibly even a 100 regardless the defective DNA lacking hillbilly of America is alive and well ready to elect an arpaio or a trump or any of several highly defective sub human abscess discharge candidates at any time.

    "Obama. An educated and lauded and respected speech maker and orator was speaking in what is called a MEASURED tone. Like most ex-Presidents you (largely) keep you mouth shut about what the acting Pres is going  through.  But this Trump fuck forces people to speak up. Even ME!  I stay out of this shit normally but the level of hazardous waste he is generating is rising to high. I'm shocked at the number of supportive comments about him i saw below this video. I have often wondered why ANYONE who is not wealthy would think  highly of this River-City con man. But the answer is below. Stupid, racist people who somehow believe this guy has ANYTHING in common with common people.  He only cares about and respects RICH PEOPLE. He's said it numerous times. His policies shit on his \"base\" and then goes there to hold a \"rally\" to make himself feel good.   He's only in office to make money. It is political usury. He's further enriched  himself, friends and family since he took office, ignoring all rules, laws in place, safeguards and protocol.  We're all paying for his record-setting number of golf trips to his owvresorts where he charges the govt. for the transpo  It's beyond stupid to think he gives a DAMN about you unless you are rich and white. In that order. It's all about Him, all the time.",

Unlike the usual parade of lying lawyers who wait for the latest (bogus) media poll to tell them what side their bread is buttered on. \n\nI still can't believe Donald did it. Everyday I say a prayer for him and this country and our world... For peace and prosperity for all 7.2 billion of us.",

Obama is the perfect contrast to the buffoon I previously mentioned; he was the best President this country has seen and heard. He took care of us, he did what was needed to keep the country moving forward. He was not weak but patient and had to judiciously choose his battles. Obama is a highly intelligent, well spoken, deeply conscious, true world leader who knows how to communicate on a level that can be understood and appreciated and felt by everyone with a heart. He was unfairly portrayed and maligned throughout his 8 year presidency, but then what is poli/tics; but a constellation of multiple blood sucking leeches ...",

We have to watch out to open doors to our weakness or wounds for our enemies to attack us - and yes, ENEMIES, because no one wants to play \"The Good Guy, Make Earth A Better Place\" card game, only WEAK and listen, weak countries are doing so. And we can't rely on weak countries. They are already getting attacked from inside and outside. We would merely be giving some of our power and share it with them, and without good results lose both. This is how it is right now, we have to be playing a mind game with everyone. We can't trust anyone, because they don't trust us. We don't know, and we are paranoid - yes, paranoid, because we think every powerful leader would want to be the leader of Earth, and we just have to be careful and strong about this! Diplomacy is at hand!\nNo one wants WW3. It means the destruction of entire planet. This is the Fear we obide by!\"\n\nTrump: \"I know exactly what the fuck you are saying Obama.

Remember the tough talking, savvy, rich guy who was going to solve all of our problems and make America great again.  Remember his obnoxious criticism of the prior administration.  Insinuating President Obama was weak, suggesting that he wasn't intelligent, suggesting that he was incompetent, predicting that Obama was going to fail miserably.  I remember him huffing and puffing as he declared Obama to be the worst president in American history.  Trump promised his supporters that he was going make great deals, and the worlds leaders were going to respect him, Isis was going to fear him and there would be peace when he became president, because Americans would finally have a strong leader.  Remember that?  It was a sham to me from day one but Americans lost their minds and voted for him.  Many voted for him against their better judgement because they thought he was going to bring about positive change in American politics.  They thought because he was a savvy business man, he was going to fix the economy over night.  Then he won the election.  Donald J Trump became POTUS.  \n\nThough I never trusted Trump, I was willing to see what he was going to do, and he showed me.  He started off by lying openly about the crowds and it didn't stop there.  Donald has headed an administration in turmoil from the beginning.  Appointing wealth bankers and business men to important cabinet positions.  In-fussing his family into government positions. He appointed individuals of dubious character, with extreme views and questionable alliances as advisers.  He has headed an administration in utter chaos and turmoil; plagued with scandal after, after scandal, after scandal.  He has proven himself to be a pathological liar.  He has insulted our allies while exalting our enemies even in the face of that enemy, in spite of the fact that evidence suggested that enemy meant us harm.  He has turned American credibility into a joke and has made us the laughing stock of the world.  He tweets policy in social media, he publicly accuses prior administrations of committing crime against him without evidence or any basis in fact.  He has divulged our secrets and has made decisions that prove him to be unstable and incompetent.  Five months in office and there is a serious movement to impeach him.  His presidency has become the brunt of everyone's jokes.  Five month in office and he is already becoming the worst president in American History.\n\nAnd the other guy?  You know, President Obama?  He completed his second term with an 8 year scandal free administration.  The economy and unemployment records at record lows, he is revered by our allies and was able to leave office with a very high approval rating.  Incompetent?  Absolutely not!!!!!!!",

So President Trump is positioned to be our best president ever. History will be very very kind to him and the smearing of the fake media and lunatic left will leave no mark at all.",

    "Dear Conservative, \n\nThe United States has never had a more tyrannical and overreaching President! He has absolutely no respect for the law or the Constitution and he can only be classified as a criminal! \n\nIn his 2014 \u201cYear of Action,\u201d President Obama has promised to go around Congress and act alone whenever possible. Rather than work with Congress, Barack Obama intends to rule the country by executive fiat. \n\nThe response in Congress has been startling. When Obama promised during his State of the Union to circumvent Congress with unconstitutional executive orders, Members of Congress actually stood up and cheered. Instead of fulfilling their Constitutional duties to write the law, Democrat Congressmen have actually begun drafting executive orders for the President to sign instead\u2026 \n\nThat\u2019s right, instead of introducing legislation for Congress to debate and vote on, Democrats are drafting executive orders for the President to sign directly. Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D) says that the \u201c[Democrat] caucus will put us on the right path and we\u2019ll give President Obama a number of executive orders that he can sign with pride and strength.\u201d The Democrats intend to make this their number one priority, Lee explains, and she urges her colleagues to \u201cwrite up these executive orders \u2014 draft them, of course \u2014 and ask the president to stand with us\u2026\u201d \n\nThe Democrats plan to push through a number of their most progressive policies by completely going around Congress. This is blatantly unconstitutional! What is even worse is the fact that Obama and the Democrats don\u2019t seem to even care\u2026 They believe that they are above the law and that they can\u2019t be touched\u2026 \n\nThey are wrong! They are NOT above the law! \n\nThankfully, the Constitution provides We the People with a means to stop this tyrannical President! We must force Congress to impeach President Barack Obama before it is too late! \n\nTake Action! Tell Congress to Impeach, Convict, and Arrest Barack Hussein Obama for high crimes committed against the American People and our Constitutional Republic! \n\nJust two months into his \u201cYear of Action\u201d when he intends to rule by executive fiat, Obama has issued a number of executive orders and directives that are neither constitutional nor logical. In many cases, the Supreme Court has already ruled that the President does not have the authority to do what he is doing. Yet, Obama continues on, daring you to stop him\u2026 \n\nThe year began with Obama promising to sign Executive Order 13658 to increase the minimum wage for Federal contractors. This is unconstitutional! The Supreme Court has already ruled in Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer that \u201cthe President\u2019s power, if any, to issue the [executive] order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.\u201d The Court elaborates, explaining that \u201cwhen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.\u201d Given the fact that Congress set the minimum wage and has yet to adjust it, any attempt by Obama to increase the minimum wage without Congress is blatantly unconstitutional! \n\nNext, the Obama administration unilaterally delayed Obamacare\u2019s Employer Mandate for the second time! This marks the 28th time that Barack Obama has unconstitutionally changed, altered, or delayed elements of the Affordable Care Act. How do we know this was unconstitutional? Well, the Supreme Court has also ruled on this issue as well! The Supreme Court ruled in Clinton vs. City of New York that the President does not have the Constitutional authority to alter a law or statute, explaining that \u201cthere is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.\u201d The Affordable Care Act explicitly says that the Employer Mandate must go into effect on Jan. 1, 2013, however thanks to Obama\u2019s lawlessness, this part of the law has been delayed until 2016. This is completely unconstitutional! \n\nLast year, when Congress refused to pass Obama\u2019s DREAM Act, which would have legalized illegal aliens brought into this country as children, the President implemented the program anyway by ordering his administration not to deport any young illegal aliens. Now, Democrats are encouraging Barack Obama to extend this executive order to ALL illegal immigrants in the country! With one signature, Obama could order his administration to cease prosecuting illegal immigrants all together! Barack Obama must be impeached, and it should have happened years ago! \n\nTake Action! Tell Congress to Impeach, Convict, and Arrest Barack Hussein Obama for high crimes committed against the American People and our Constitutional Republic! \n\nCongress is starting to hear us. Both Republicans and Democrats recognize that the President\u2019s executive orders and directives are \u201clawless\u201d and \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d \n\nSen. Mike Lee has been one of the most vocal opponents of Obama\u2019s unconstitutional executive orders. On Obama\u2019s decision to delay the Employer Mandate again, Lee criticized the action as \u201ca shameless power grab\u201d and that the \u201cConstitution doesn\u2019t give the President that power.\u201d \n\nWhat does Mike Lee intend to do about this? Nothing! \n\nOn a recent Sunday morning talk show, Sen. Mike Lee agreed that Obama\u2019s executive directives were tyrannical and lawless, but the Senator admitted that \u201clittle can be done about it.\u201d \n\nLittle can be done about it? What on earth is Mike Lee talking about? \n\nThe GOP has been touting the fact that 100 Congressional Republicans have signed onto the Stop This Overreaching President (STOP) Resolution. What the GOP doesn\u2019t understand is that the American people don\u2019t want a weak, unenforceable resolution that will eventually die in the Senate, anyway. The American people don\u2019t want Congress to just act for the sake of acting. \n\nThere is only one way to definitively stop Barack Obama\u2019s tyranny and the Constitution exclusively empowers Congress to do so through impeachment proceedings. Only Congress can stop Obama, yet they don\u2019t even want to consider that measure! The founders didn\u2019t intend for \u2018impeachment\u2019 to be a taboo subject. The impeachment provision of the Constitution is designed as a mechanism for the American people and their representatives in Congress to stop a tyrannical and overbearing executive. \n\nJust two months into the year, Obama\u2019s actions in 2014 alone warrant impeachment proceedings. Impeachment provides an opportunity for the President to answer to the American people directly. Yet, we aren\u2019t only looking at what the President has done this year\u2026 Obama has five previous years of unconstitutional executive orders and actions that pale in comparison to his recent efforts. \n\nHow about the fact that Obama gave rifles to Mexican drug cartels, who then used them to kill an American border patrol agent? That is a blatantly criminal act, yet, like Richard Nixon, Obama exerted executive privilege to keep his administration\u2019s criminal acts classified! \n\nHow about the fact that when Americans were being ambushed by terrorists in Benghazi, Libya, Obama told the military to \u201cstand down\u201d and just let them die? \n\nHow about the fact that, like Richard Nixon, Barack Hussein Obama used the IRS to target and silence his political opponents? \n\nThe President has asserted that he possesses the authority to spy on your phone calls without warrant, infringe on your second amendment rights without cause, and assassinate American citizens abroad without due process! \n\nThis is tyranny and Congress must impeach Barack Obama now! \n\nTake Action! Tell Congress to Impeach, Convict, and Arrest Barack Hussein Obama for high crimes committed against the American People and our Constitutional Republic! \n\nA recent Economist poll finds that 71% of Obama voters regret voting for the President. It is no surprise that Obama\u2019s approval rating is lower than ever. The American people overwhelmingly disagree with the President on every one of his policy proposals, yet the President continues to press on with his unpopular agenda. So, the American people voted for Congressmen and Senators who represent their interests. Instead of accepting that he is a lame-duck President, Barack Obama has pledged to go around Congress to unconstitutionally implement his agenda. \n\nCongress has an obligation to impeach, convict, and arrest this criminal President. That much is true. But, you also have an obligation to force Congress to act! You have a duty to hold Congress\u2019 feet to the fire and refuse to accept anything short of impeachment and conviction! \n\nOver the past week, more Congressmen and Senators have come out and voiced their support of impeachment proceedings. The candidates running to replace retiring and vulnerable legislators are deliberately making impeachment a part of their platforms. Why? Because the American people demand it! \n\nThe American people have had enough watching this President violate his oath of office and the constitution! The American people deserve answers. The President must answer for his crimes and only impeachment proceedings can force him to! \n\nTake Action! Tell Congress to Impeach, Convict, and Arrest Barack Hussein Obama for high crimes committed against the American People and our Constitutional Republic",

Obama says he's not prepared for presidency and he immediately starts bashing Obama saying Obama is the worst president ever. how can any human being watch what trump has done, and still vote for him. every person who is supporting trump is saying what he is doing is perfectly ok. every fucking person, that is sitting here defending his actions might as well sit in front of their children and be telling them that bullying, rape, hatred, racism and more is ok. Did everyone forget that this election is to decide who is going to run the united states of fucking america? this person is going to be a role model, someone little fucking kids are supposed to look up to. our children are going to grow up through 4 years with a racist, ignorant, sexual assaulting president and think that those action are ok because the president did it and everyone turned their fucking heads. America is great, vote trump in and allowing what he has done to just be ignored is what will make america a joke. \nwho can honestly say they want their children to look up to a racist. \nwho can actually go to sleep at night knowing their little girl is going to grow up the next 4 years knowing its ok for her to be degrade and assaulted just because she's a girl. \nwho is it ok for a presidential candidate to do all of these things but if a I smoke a plant to help me function normally I get sent to jail. \nhow can america let something like this get so out of hand. \nthis isn't a joke guys, this isn't a dream. if something is not done now, then I'm genuinely afraid, terrified, of what will happen in the next 4 years.",

He's not interested in people - he wants money, because money makes power. And not for you, the sorry mass of dimwits flocking around him, but for him. Solely for himself. And while on the mention of him being a business man, remember he's a rather poor one at that. He didn't MAKE his fortune, he INHERITED it! On top of that, he nearly lost it, too! He insisted Obama show his birth certificate to prove him being born in the U.S., but he refuses to show his tax papers to prove he's not dead broke? Come on, it reeks of poor judgement from any voter's side to accept that from a public person and would-be leader. He is not a man who spreads a vibe of trustworthiness. 'Cause, let's face it, criticizing others isn't a way to make yourself look better, owning up to your own words and accusations is.

    "anyway, my main point was that, if a person has a hard working job and still lives with a relatively low stress, happier lifestyle, imagine how much more productive, level headed, and understanding that person would be. we need a president who is smart, happy, productive, sophisticated, wise and with high level of integrity. I wish we wouldn't have to settle for less, but we are in times of desperation. unfortunately, there have been no candidates that were able to make it to elections that have had these qualities. We really are just victims of ourselves. We failed to become or create the perfect leader for our nation, now we will suffer the outcome of this. What else to blame would be the fact that the election system is set to a certain amount of years each for term, so we only have that much time to come up with the next best president.",
    "think about this guys. do you think trump lives a happy, relatively low stress lifestyle? you might think he does, because he's rich and \"smart\". or you might think he doesn't because of all the \"work\" related stress he's going through, which, might seem like a reasonable justification to be stressed out, but really, it's not, because if he was smart enough, he wouldn't be as stressed out in the first place. I'm not making any claims if whether or not  trump is a happy person, but if you really pay attention to the way he acts and goes about topics, he doesn't exactly seem like much a pacifist, to say the least. especially the way trump made that first \"rebuttal\" to the clip they showed of Obama making a statement about trump. Out of a good candidate, I would expect, if any at all the most humble response to a statement like that. Not some charged up, angry spew of shit. The moment I saw trumps face when I loaded the video, I just knew he was about to gush something angry and ignorant.",

You \"love\" the guy if you share similar opinions and interests, you hate him if it's the opposite. that makes me think citizens who vote for trump must prefer him because they agree with his views, which, to me, is sad.  he reminds me of most everyday people I meet when they walk into dairy queen. personally, I want a president who is one of a kind. one that is truly wise and sophisticated. not a president that is going to agree with just about everything the old fashioned, racist, and ignorant crowds of people that live in America. the only reasonable explanation I can see that would explain the cause of trump's popularity is because he is a liar and he knows how to blend in with the crowd, after all, it seems like all some people want these days is someone to agree with them.",

This man is full of scars and sequels due to attacks on him, on his needs and on his richness. \n\nTHIS MAN THINKS OF USA AS BEING HIS OWN HOUSE\n- He uses the trash bucket when he has something to thrown. He doesn't get rid of the garbage around his living room, in hallways or in his bed;\n- He wants to protect his personal property, as each pulls up a fence around their house. He needs a front door to stop the others entering anytime and anywhere into his intimacy;\n- He want to be a member of this great family, whit all those together who maintains this house, where all should have equal rights. Mr. Trump thinks that a parent is obligated to love his offspring, sharing responsibilities that these children could support;\n- Mr. Trump thinks widely, looking for The Big Picture, even if for some people, with smaller thinking, this means tyranny. He wants each one to learn to make mistakes, from this being able to develop, but also to assume their own sins;\n- He is tired to be fooled by these great leaders, by these presumed parents, who should protect their children. How, the fuck, are you responsible, as a mom and as a dad, if you teach your boys to become barbarians, attacking other neighboring houses? How are you protective, with tutorial rights, if you allow that in your own home to enter and reside all kinds of foreign characters who believe that women don't have equal rights with men? What monstrous conceptions can develop your own daughters? \n\nWe are all like any other being and non-being of all the universe. We are as well as the asteroids in space. as all suns and the rest of this whole entire galaxy. \nIn fact we are this whole infinite as well; as the infinitesimal organisms that are the basis of the whole rest; the virus masses of everywhere, which also trying to thrive. And like the bee families, we are too - who need to beware of predators such as wasps. And I don't say that these thieves of honey and criminals of bees that are lower than anything else, but which themselves need to make their own place into this existence as anyone and anything else, into all this \"chaos\".\n\nI love the fascist thinking, but only a half of it. The history has taught us to learn from our mistakes. The tyranny is very useful, just as a parent sometimes must rebuke his own children.\nSo I love the Hitler\u2019s thinking, but only a half of it, and Mr. Trump learn from our history mistakes as everybody and everything else. And from this it follows that I, a gypsy from Romania - my own tyrant of my family, I respect 100% the path of this man, Mr. Donald Trump.\n\nP.S.

It is like he is trying to coach him and help him but Trump just won't listen.  He tries to do it in a smart way so that there will be sympathy with Trump's position with recent Media stories, yet the word's out of Trumps mouth just don't allow O'Reilly to actually sway the conversation in a way beneficial to Trump. He starts off with a quote from Obama related to Khan, and then when Trump when completely lost focus and starts talking about the fact that in a recent interview he was actually unaware that Russia invaded Ukraine after saying that Russia would never attack Ukraine he had to \"re-focus\" (O'Reilly's words) Trump to get him back to the subject. Let's face it, the Russia - Ukraine incident is a conversation even O'Reilly doesn't want to step into. Then he continues to try to paint Trump in a light in which Trump could be apologetic for the petty and unimportant comments he made about the Mother and in this way will solidify and cause forgetfulness about the real and important comments he made about the lost veteran, but Trump continues to deny his fault in anything. This makes O'Reillys job of looking like an antagonizer while actually swaying public opinion and sympathy towards Trump hard, and it also looks like the two have a past and O'Reilly clearly thinks he is much more intelligent than Trump, which he most certainly is. Trump probably tried to borrow O'Reillys Tempur-Pedic money to build a paper casino at one point and O'Reilly said no way Trump your corporations always claim bankruptcy to reduce what you have to pay to your creditors.

    "Under Democrats black Americans and all minorities have the highest unemployment rates, lowest amount of home ownership, lowest amount of high school and college graduate, highest poverty rates,  highest crime ridden and unsafe neighborhoods, highest drug and alcohol addictions, and near 75% of black children grow up without fathers.\n\nToday the overwhelming majority of black children are raised in single female-headed families. As early as the 1880s, three-quarters of black families were two-parent. In 1925 New York City, 85 percent of black families were two-parent. One study of 19th-century slave families found that in up to three-fourths of the families, all the children had the same mother and father.\n\nToday's black illegitimacy rate of nearly 75 percent is also entirely new. In 1940, black illegitimacy stood at 14 percent. It had risen to 25 percent by 1965, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action\" and was widely condemned as a racist. By 1980, the black illegitimacy rate had more than doubled, to 56 percent, and it has been growing since. Both during slavery and as late as 1920, a teenage girl raising a child without a man present was rare among blacks.\n\nMuch of today's pathology seen among many blacks is an outgrowth of the welfare state that has made self-destructive behavior less costly for the individual. Having children without the benefit of marriage is less burdensome if the mother receives housing subsidies, welfare payments and food stamps. Plus, the social stigma associated with unwed motherhood has vanished. Female-headed households, whether black or white, are a ticket for dependency and all of its associated problems. Ignored in all discussions is the fact that the poverty rate among black married couples has been in single digits since 1994.\n\nBlack youth unemployment in some cities is over 50 percent. But high black youth unemployment is also new. In 1948, the unemployment rate for black teens was slightly less than that of their white counterparts \u2014 9.4 percent compared with 10.2.\n\nDuring that same period, black youths were either just as active in the labor force or more so than white youths. Since the 1960s, both the labor force participation rate and the employment rate of black youths have fallen to what they are today. Why? Are employers more racially discriminatory today than yesteryear? Were black youths of yesteryear more skilled than whites of yesteryear? The answer to both questions is a big fat no.\n\nThe minimum wage law and other labor regulations have cut off the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. Put yourself in the place of an employer, and ask: If I must pay $7.25 an hour \u2014 plus mandated fringes, such as Social Security and workers' compensation \u2014 would it pay me to hire a worker who is so unfortunate as to possess skills that enable him to produce only $5 worth of value per hour? Most employers view that as a losing economic proposition. Thus, the minimum wage law discriminates against the employment of low-skilled workers, who are most often youths \u2014 particularly black youths.\n\nThe little bit of money a teenager can earn through after-school, weekend and summer employment is not nearly so important as the other things he gains from early work experiences. He acquires skills and develops good work habits, such as being prompt, following orders and respecting supervisors. In addition, there are the self-respect and pride that a youngster gains from being financially semi-independent. All of these gains from early work experiences are important for any teen but are even more important for black teens. If black teens are going to learn anything that will make them a more valuable employee in the future, they aren't going to learn it from their rotten schools, their dysfunctional families or their crime-ridden neighborhoods. They must learn it on the job.\n\nThe bulk of today's problems for many blacks are a result of politicians and civil rights organizations using government in the name of helping blacks when in fact they are serving the purposes of powerful interest groups.",

It pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda and participated in the Iraqi insurgency following the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces. Joining other Sunni insurgent groups to form the Mujahideen Shura Council, this group proclaimed the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) in October 2006. In August 2011, following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, ISI, under the leadership of al-Baghdadi, delegated a mission into Syria, which under the name Jabhat an-Nu\u1e63rah li-Ahli ash-Sh\u0101m (or al-Nusra Front) established a large presence in Sunni-majority Al-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor, and Aleppo provinces.",

    "Can the shariah increase jobs, can the shariah manage immigration? Can the shariah manage all religions peacefully like in Europe or America? Can the shariah build a military equivalent to America or Russia's power? Can the shariah even build a car, a plane, or mobile technologies or a simple bread toaster? Why isn't the shariah in the Muslim countries getting rid of hunger, thirst, rape, and civil war? Again, the shariah answer is shariah to everything! Why are Muslims migrating to the EU and to America? It's because of a better humanitarian  stable civilization. Plus their shariah has failed them. Europe and America have a better opportunity, for all kind of religions or personal situations. Now you want to spread your corrupted fantasy which can't even build a hair gel, thorough out the west. Trying to destabilize the stabilized! rather than trying to establish the shariah, and stabilizing your own country where you came from. Maybe an ISIS Islamic shariah is your answer to a peaceful Islamic civilizations. An ISIS shariah is your desire, your final shariah country system result, for defining a shariah an ISIS peaceful civilization is the shariah answer. It's the example, the shariah answer you want to implement in the western world. Heck I don't want to see violence, rape and slavery, thirst and hunger, in Europe. If it's only peaceful, anywhere in the world, stable and consistent. Example; Europe and the American citizens will then migrate there or visit you. For relationship and business. Religion and development have different angles to building and developing a country. U.K and the Western world, wasn't build from religion. It was build from hard work, science, passion, and industrial civil engineering. It was built by builders!! not religiousness! STOP mixing religion with the development of the country. Religion is not the fastest way to build a strong global civilization.  Corrupted psychological fantasy civilization. The mental psychological cause to rape, unsafe, civil war, extremism, in the Arab world. RELIGION is not the answer TO DEVELOPMENT OF THE  AFRICAN MIDDLE EASTERN, DESSERT!

No candidate really knows what's going on until they take office. Thatta way to promote your candidate using your power. I regret to have vote for you. We picked the best of the worse. People need a strong leader, a man who will tell it like it is and will, at least, try to change things and remain strong (unlike you). Trump's only big downfall is that he's not a politician so he will say what's in his mind. At the end of the day, the man is one of the richest man in this country and did it all by himself. I won't be voting for him, but in between him and the other one I would pick a no bullshit man over a woman who abuses her power and is hungry for more",

He's a weak crybaby who says nothing of substance. He just responds with saying the other one is \"bombing\" or they're doing poorly. When a person attacks the other instead of giving a direct response, that shows they have nothing to say. The NY TIMES is doing poorly? Right. Megan Kelly bombed? Right. Such a whiny little baby.",

    "Since our country\u2019s President is elected by majority of Americans, then the evaluations of pro and con should let Americans voice to say, because this will be the most accurate and reasonable evaluations, I guess.  I also believe that may not be the appropriate manners to criticize successor\u2019s governing leadership, let Americans to feel, sense, learn by their own feelings according to America\u2019s own principles.  This is why I totally understand that why President Bush 41and President Bush 43 never want to criticize their successors, but let New President to lead and govern by their own styles and let Americans of all to evaluate themselves.  Their attitude is to support and help newly elected President to lead and govern only according to our country America\u2019s own principles of either election laws or Constitution only.  Also I believe that during the Presidency campaign, Mr. Trump shouldn\u2019t say Gov. Bush is low energy person, because people\u2019s madness really had nothing to do with Gov. Bush at all, he was a great Governor of Florida.  Although it was campaign, still it was our own manners and appreciation for great, good, better, ok services and contributions to our country.  Although it was the debate, after that, still are friends for America\u2019s greatness to work out together instead of hurting or others, I guess.  Surely elected President Trump has learned much after he became elected President Trump.  I believe that he learned quickly and worked very hard without paychecks and achieved some important things with Congress altogether or his administration.  I believe that it\u2019s time for all of us to unite together again by our country America\u2019s principles from now on and in the future and our own generous mind of forgiveness to put our energy, time and financial resources to achieve greatness by getting things done quickly together again.  America\u2019s principles and unity together are the strength of our country by learning experience to understand more and do better things from now on and in the future.  I also believe and wish that Gov. Bush\u2019s quality will be able to serve and contribute together again for America\u2019s greatness by the principles as well as by elected President Trump\u2019s leadership wisdom of generosity for America\u2019s greatness.  One step further, unity and getting things done quickly altogether won\u2019t be too hard to achieve.  Not easy to be generous mind as ordinary Americans, not to hard to achieve the unity by generosity, kindness and wisdom through learning experiences as governing leaderships, I guess.  Let\u2019s be united together by our country America\u2019s own principles of freedom and equality of the opportunities and patriotism and loyalty toward America\u2019s greatness.

    "He's weak, they weak. blah blah blah. Thats all he fucking says. I wanna see him do better. This fool would be the biggest disaster in U.S. history as president. But I wont ever get to rub it in Trump dick sucker faces because he most certainly will not win. He has NO CLUE about politics. He runs businesses (most of it done for him by other people, the piece if shit just uses his name) , HE DOESN'T KNOW PEOPLE. Real people. He will send us to war against fucking china. And the damn fool calls himself a global economical savvy individual, but he wants a fucking trade war with China??? If we have an economic war with China WE WOULD GET RAPED. \n\nIf youd like to defend Trump, I want you to tell me why he'd be a good president and elaborate. About his economic plans, political and policy recommendation. Elaborate. Be smart and specific. If you just say to me youre a liberal and blah fucking blah (im a republican) and im stupid even though I studied economics and know more politics than most you fools, then by all means, Lets have an intelligent debate. If all you have to say is he's a rich business guy and youre a liberal and Hilary is evil then go fuck your cousin and drink your beer like an idiot. NO Trump supporter has EVER given a real argument of why he will be a good president. Because he won't be. DO NOT SAY better than Hilary. That's your only argument.",

    "The following letter was published in the Colorado Springs Gazette, under the\nheading \u2018Your Viewpoint\u2019.Look at the rest of the story \u2013 I am a Gold Star mother who has experienced an emotional week since the Kahn family chose to enter the political arena and attack Donald Trump at the Democratic convention.\u00a0 The ensuing media frenzy after Trump unfortunately felt compelled to strike back has been unbelievably intense in this election year.\n\nWhile I applaud Capt. Kahn for his heroic service to our country and sympathize with the Kahn family in our shared loss of a beloved son, that is where my support for them stops.\u00a0 While they have every right to speak out, their actions when they appeared on stage at the behest of the Hillary campaign have, sadly, politicized Gold Star families.\u00a0 This past week, the Kahn\u2019s have been on\nnumerous television shows, and their story has been heard from coast to coast.\u00a0 While I hesitate to further politicize this issue, I feel like, to be fair, my voice should be heard, as well. \u00a0The Kahn family does not speak for me.\nThose of you who are old enough to remember Paul Harvey know that it\u2019s always a good idea to \u201clook at the rest of the story.\u201d\u00a0 I did so and suggest that those reading this letter do so, as well, so you can draw conclusions.\u00a0 As for me, after learning more about Khizr Kahn\u2019s affiliations and the mission of his law firm, I found that it could be construed that Kahn used his son\u2019s sacrifice and his elevated status as a Gold Star father to advance his agenda in a very public way.\u00a0 I find that very distasteful.\u00a0 I am not fooled by Kahn sanctimoniously\nwaving a copy of our Constitution on national TV, and I can recognize an\norchestrated setup when I see one.\u00a0 Enough said!\n\nNow, let\u2019s see if we can turn our thoughts back to the important issues that face our country, as there are many!Nancy Hecker\nColorado Springs",

This little girl, as stated in the news, was raped, and urinated on by three Syrian refugee boys of the ages 8, 11, and 13. The boys took her at knife point into a laundry room and proceeded to take part on the previous stated actions which was videotaped by the eldest boy. The father was also caught on tape high fiving the boys for their actions. The incident as well as the video was submitted to the police department. However, due to a language barrier, and the ages of the children involved, this case is being sealed.

    "Harvard Republican ClubDear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses \u2013from racist slander to misogynistic taunts\u2013 is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump\u2019s platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump\u2019s global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States\u2019 responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US\u2019 withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight \u2013perceived or real\u2013 Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump\u2019s eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot \u2013and that\u2019s just his \u201cfellow\u201d Republicans.He isn\u2019t eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party\u2019s elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, \u201cAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.\u201d De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.The Harvard Republican Club",

Second, the word 'again' is in his motto, which means that he wants to bring it back to a period of time when it was great. What years do you mean? What years was America greater than it is today? \n\nThis is a question that me and 99% of the rest of the world is asking: Why the fuck are you voting for a childish psycopath with outdated views of the world\u00a0to be in the most powerful position in the world???

He makes accusations that aren't backed up with persuasive facts. Now, if we factor in his personality then HOLY FUCK - it is just fucking disgusting. Yes. \"fuck\" is the only way I can describe the horrendous, ignorant, and disrespectful person he is. Yeah yeah....he doesn't like to be \"politically correct'. That's fine, you don't have to.

Also, if you don't have some strong connections in the office then well....your ideas will face a lot of difficulties becoming a law. When your own parties are against you then I'm not sure how you're gonna pass the laws you are promising (if he does figure out a plan for these laws).

As a result, I just simply want to hear his goals, and AT LEAST the rough drafts of how he is going to get to those goals. That will show me that he knows that he's talking about and whether he's the man/woman for the job. I'm neither a Republic or a Democrat currently, but I am for sure an American. \n\nLook. All I'm saying is I want a person in the office that knows what they are doing. You can make all the great advertisements, but if I don't know how it works then I can't stand behind the products, the ideas, or the source.

He may have ended the Cold War, but he did in the wrong way. You can't lower taxes and increase government spending. Where does the other money come from? Investors, and lenders.

A woman has a very hard time to get a divorce and if she does the man has the primary care of their children.  This discussion needs to happen.  So Mr. Trump is right.

He is a con man, who gives away American land to business men outside of the U.S, mainly Russians. His family thinks as he does, their own interest is the only thing that is important. As far as his wife and daughters are concern, they don't stand for anything; Women's Right, Abortion, equal pay, Day care, Elderly, etc. Their reality is not of the people.

If he can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen. Also, he is so jealous of President Obama's eloquence. He speaks like a junior high schooler while it's obvious that President Obama is scholarly.

    "When Trump got involved with WWE, I was in no way impressed with Trump's personality, but when Trump was elected president I hoped for the best. When Trump was elected, his critics claimed they had the lowest of lowest of expectations  for the Trump presidency. If anyone had such low expectations they would have to be impressed with the fact that Trump has gotten anything what so ever done. I know we live in a world where it is easier for some people to lie  than tell the truth, but at least make sure your lies today are at least logical and go along  with your previous lies.",
    "A man from the UK commented that Camron was talking ish about trump and he said the U K higher ups don't want Trump as our president, and he was trying to understand American politics ( generally )\n^reply* Well if the ridiculing u heard took place 5 years ago, when Trump was suggesting that he was going to run against Obama for president. Well then the ridiculing was probably justified, no Americans took Trump serious back then when it came to him actually being our president & on top of that not many people even thought that he would ever run nor have the chance to win if he did run. ( including myself )\u00a0 ( Back then is when he was bring up Obama's birth certificate and sh!t like that, Americans just wasn't have'n non of it, to many real problems to be talking about something so silly as that, is what most people here thought ) ( you see back then Trump was playing the republican and Democrat game, meaning he was being a normal politician ) . \nMost Americans really started paying attention to President Trump when he ran against H. Clinton. Trump was just being himself, taking no BullSh!t from the media and most importantly he was actually giving Ideas and some solutions if elected pres. AND HE WAS FEIRCLY STICK'N BY HIS OWN BELIEFS AND IDEAS ASWELL, WHICH WAS SUPER RARE TO DO SO EXSPECIASLLY SO EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT., In the political world that is a big no no cause they don't wanna be to attached to firm stance on nothing until they become president, just in case they have to flop or switch later on before the actual election takes place, ( they don't wanna lose votes ) I only explain it like this cause I know nothing about yhall's process of election and not sure what u know about ours ............ Anyways Trump generally has 2 types of supporters here in America. 1st type of supporters , they are the republicans till I die and that's just the way it is, ( they play the game ) 2nd type ( which is what I am ) we are the ones who vote for the man or woman that we feel will do the best job, we are the ones who were really impressed with trump through the election process ( impressed and at the same time in disbelief because of the way he was single handedly putting the media in there place.) He was saying on the highest platform available in the world to say it, say what many of us Americans wish we could say and be heard by the world, and that is *WE AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF BEING BETRAYED BY THE MEDIA, THEY DON'T SPEAK FOR US AND GENERALLY DONT REPERSENT WHAT MOST AMERICANS REALLY ARE LIKE,\u00a0 THEYRE ALWAYS TRYING TO PERTRAY US AS FU(KING IDDIOTS WHO WILL BELIVE ANYTHING, AND ALWAYS MAKING IT SOUND LIKE\u00a0 WE ARE ALL IN 1GROUP OR THE OTHER, 1 SIDE OR THE OTHER, AND ECT. ECT................... WHEN REALLY MOST OF US DONT BELIEVE NON OF THEIR ASSES, FOX CNN , NONE OF THEM, WERE TIRED OF THEIR GAMES AND BULLSH!T. I don't agree with everything President Trump says or does. Some things are down right wrong but I believe if he can just stay focused on why he ran for pres. and come back to some sense of calm\u00a0\u00a0 he will get a lot accomplished and make a lot of Americans proud. ( fyi I liked Obama too but I knew he was a politician meaning same O same O , ya know? )\nI don't like politics & never would I claim to be in 1 of they're fake @ss republican or Democratic groups ta play da game of corruption. *I do understand the real purpose of our gov creating these groups though. The real reason for creating them is 1 of if not the only reason that the USA became the most powerful country to ever run this earth and while now days it plays a part but isn't the main reason that the USA runs shyt now days but its def. still relevant. The main reason for creating them was to give an illusion to the rest of the world that their is actually 2 USA govs 1 dem. & 2 Rep. The purpose was and is so when a rep. or a dem.\u00a0 pres is in office he can bomb da h&ll outta whoever he wants or cause the damage needed to accomplish there agendas. Then depending on the damage he does is how the gov decides if the other party needs to be elected and smooth out the mess while the new president symantaneously on a global level puts down the last pres that created it. This creates the illiusion of separation when in all actuality there is no separation just a long ever changing plan that exists. To be honest though I I hope its ever lasting as well because while even though I don't like it, the truth, If were not running the show no more that can only mean one thing and that thing is, SOMEONE ELSE IS RUNNING THE WORLD AND CREATING A NEW GAME MAYBE NOT AS SECRETIVE AS OUR GOV'S BUT WHO KNOWS MAYBE MUCH MORE BLUNT AND BRUTA;.*IMMIGRATION concerns Solution ! There should be A Center in every major city in America where for the next 6 months Any person in the United States Illegally can go too with the promise of no penalties for already existing or living here illegally and a lenient fast tracked process to citizenship. After the 6 months is up , CLOSE THE CENTERS & THEN THE ICE AGENCY SHOULD GO HARD AND REALLY PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO GET THE ONES WHO DIDNT REPORT IN FOR CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE 6 MONTHS, GET'EM OUT OF HERE!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 IF THIS HAPPENS HOW CAN ANYBODY FEEL BAD FOR THOSE WHO DIDNT GO TO THE CENTER TO GET CITIZENSHIP ?\u00a0\u00a0 WE CANT FEEL BAD AFTER THAT !\u00a0 I FEEL BAD RIGHT NOW THOUGFH FOR ANY PEOPLE GETTING KICKED OUT OF OUR COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE THEY WAS DOING WHAT ANY OF US WOULD DO AND THATS TRY AND GIVE OUR FAMILIES A BETTER LIFE ! real talk",

I could bet you he could not last a week  or say month in a regular life as typical Amercian in a day to day go work come home take care of the family live off the food tge average American families do. I d love to see that. Never will happen why because in reality he is the loser not to know what real happiness is or Real Love. The man has been married 3 times he is adultery type. I would not want be him when he meets our Creator. You know money can buy alot of things on Earth.

As he repeatedly told US, \"'The buck stops here!'\"   Oh yeah,  he killed three of the world's enemies,  put national health insurance in place, worked for everybody  without attention to the so-called race or nationality or religion or creed of people.  Obama never got caught with his ass/face exposed (as trump-da-rump'\"shithole countries'\" historical statement) never once refered to himself as a \"' stable genius \"' because most geniuses are not stable.  Obama wears his genius quietly!  Besides all of the other presidential  achievements,  Obama worked for more then three hours per day.  Kept  US  well informed with eloquence, grace,  humor, and respect for American citizens.  Unlike trump-da-rump,,  Obama is an honorable  man.  He shows love to his family.

So if we now prove that the DNC emails was leaked by Seth Rich and the Podesta emails where leaked from a fishing expedition the Russian narrative is over because it proves they were not involved in the DNC hacking at all making the claims for the past year from the democratic party and the mainstream media nothing more than a conspiracy story that got proven wrong making them look like they were intentionally a way for them to attack President Trump and to beat the drum for war with Russia over a lie just as the Iraq war was based on a lie. They need to be held accountable for their actions for trying to place the blame on a country, their xenophobic calls towards Russians, how that effected Russian Americans, took us closer to war with Russia, back in the cold war era with their red scare narrative proproganda that they beated non stop night after night on mainstream media knowing they had no evidence. This also pits to rest any claims for Russian collision because if the Russians exonerated from hacking into our election they are then free and clear of interfering in our election so claims of Russian collusion is also free and cleared especially since there is no evidence of that as well, but they are innocent of interfering in our election theybare also innocent of collusion claims. Which means the democratic party has to fact the facts of their own lost being not because of outside interference, the election being stolen but their own fault and lack of actions they need to own up too. We can now focus on what is important, the needs of the American people regarding the economy, health care, education, foreign policy, etc. Its time that the democratic party moves on to the next faze in grieving....bargaining..they have been in the denial and anger stages but its time for them to move into the nexr faze then we can have them entwr the depression and acceptance stages and finally be able to get things done hopefully in congress and have the people that are out protessing be less violent then they have been.",

We are truly living in perilous times! We have a President in Donald Trump who is WELL QUALIFIED to be Secretary of Commerce or Labor or US Trade Representative BUT NOT President of the United States of America. Donald Trump does not really have a\u00a0broad and inspiring political vision\u00a0for the American people as did Reagan and Ford and Bush Sr did. Donald Trump's speech at Liberty University was a great speech but he is not ready to be President of the United States of America. Donald Trump lacks the right temperament and character to be President. He continues to tweet and not\u00a0listen to his cabinet secretaries! THIS IS DANGEROUS!\u00a0AT LEAST, George W. Bush LISTENED to his cabinet secretaries! Donald Trump does what he wants to do, says what he wants to say, and is not operating in harmony\u00a0with his cabinet secretaries!\u00a0If he did, that would make Sarah Huckabee's and Sean Spicer's job so much easier! Donald J Trump is the\u00a0quarterback of the political arena and he MUST be in harmony with\u00a0his offensive line, his cabinet secretaries! If he does not make this adjustment, I fear that he will become a one term President\u00a0but worse, the country will suffer for four years of chaotic leadership.

    "If I had a magic wand, I'd wave it and make peace on Earth and good will for all a reality.  Barring that option, here are my thoughts on what to do while under attack with a duty to protect more than just myself.  \n\nGiven the Russian troll/propaganda attacks on democracy, my first point has to be to recognize that the stakes are as high as they get so whatever is done to defend and protect must be EFFECTIVE.  What is proven... what is known... is that NONVIOLENT methods are the most effective ways to create pervasive, lasting change.  So, do those.\n\nI like this standard:  \"Do as you will but harm none.\"\n\nIf you prefer brief answers... just read the first sentence of each point.\n\n1.  Be informed enough to CHOOSE democracy or to know why you don't.  Pause.  Just pause.  Begin with you.  Ask yourself if you understand different forms of government enough to know why democracy is the one you want.  If not, then spend even a half hour on becoming competent enough to compare democracy to authoritarian forms of government and to be familiar with flaws in each.  Specifically, know how democracies fall into authoritarian states.  \n\n(I suggest watching Rachel Maddow's report on oil-state nations, Rex Tillerson/Exxon, Putin and the deal between Russia and the U.S. that sanctions blocked - billions in profits.)\n\n2.  Speak and act in ways which reflect your values.  I'm pro-democracy... perhaps fiercely protective of it... because I value individual human rights and freedom for all, above all else.  As an American, that means I am an active part of self-governance.  I have to stand up, show up and speak up.\n\n(I URGENTLY suggest that every citizen contribute what they can to defend and promote democracy right now.  Almost everyone can do something.)\n\nFor shy/loner/social anxiety people:  Call representatives after hours.  Leave a respectful, calm, clear message on their voice mail (include your full name and your zip code).  Send an email, a letter, a post card, a thank-you card, sign a petition, a text...  Write a song, create a game, write a story, create art, choreograph a dance... get the message out using your skills and interests.\n\nFor social people: All of the above AND volunteer... for an agency, a nonprofit, a political group or organize and attend marches, protests, fundraisers, etc...\n\n3.  Defend and protect American institutions of democracy... they are incapable of protecting themselves BECAUSE they are not separate and apart from individual citizens.  What's going on now - these unrelenting attacks on them - this is the part where the usual laid-back citizens need to do their part.  THEY need US.  \n\n(During this time of attacks, take special care to be extremely specific when criticizing our own institutions.  Got a problem with one reporter or one report... say so and ADD to that, your general support and/or trust.  Do NOT unwittingly parrot the anti-democracy language and tactics of those whom attack us, such as: \"fake news,\" any variation of \"tard or turd\" and using a political ideology or party in a tone which is the same as used when hurling slurs.)\n\n4.  Think about, and re-commit, to our Pledge of Allegiance.  UNITED States, Republic, One Nation, INDIVISIBLE with liberty and justice for ALL.  See how much unity is emphasized?\n\nINDIVISIBLE - even as we vehemently disagree!  That open, free debate IS the pulse of democracy.  The conflict tests our own positions, sharpens our arguments, teaches us what we can't see from our own perspective but need to consider and ultimately, serves the goal of representing our society in ways which promote \"liberty and justice for ALL.\"\n\n5.  To differ does not equate with being divided.  Dictators disparage opposing views because divide and conquer works and they serve themselves... which is unlike American Presidents whose role is that of Pubic Servant, accountable to citizens whom granted them a position of trust, power and responsibility.\n\n6.  Give trump-supporters a chance.  None of us knows everything and they made a grave mistake... but he hunted them, found them, researched them, preyed upon their desperation and/or ignorance using sophisticated means such as NLP indoctrination techniques at his rallies.  \n\nThen and now, he continues the intrusive assaults on them with his tweets, conditioning them in Pavlov's Dogs fashion, to constantly re-experience being a passive, unquestioning follower of the proclamations - which is the opposite of the identity of citizens whom hold public servants accountable. \n\nThis constant erosion of critical thinking skills and of fair-mindedness that happens every single time a tweet is accepted as true or as factual, WITHOUT evidence, the trump-followers are weakened.  He's harming them... and because we are ONE NATION, that hurts ALL of us.\n\nImagine we are soldiers in a unit.  None of us is liked or likes everybody, so banter flies.  We're resting and the banter gets more piercing.  Then shots are fired at us - some are hit.  Do we keep hurling insults?  NO!  We rush to the aid of the wounded and fend off the attack.  \n\ntrump got the most votes from areas with the highest rates of alcoholism, opiate addiction and suicides - vulnerable people struggling with life-threatening illnesses... which compromise judgment.  He targeted them.  By \"them\" I refer to OUR sister/fellow Americans.\n\nIf \"we\" know so much better than trump-supporters, then maybe \"we\" need to include them in the groups of vulnerable people we defend?  Every single issue must be treated as secondary to UNITED WE STAND.",

    "IMO unless the killers spouse knows about depression she would not know what was going on with this killer.  This guy had major depression and based on my personal experience depressed people are very smart.  The killer was definitely planning a get away, in his sick mind, and he needed another safe house in the Philippines.  My ex was bipolar and I lived with this nonsense for 18 years.  I personally went to many doctors to understand depression and what goes on in the mind of a depressed individual.  The bottom line is that they get pissed off about something, in their mind, and then the rage builds over time.  He didn't just snap.  His rage began to build probably 2 or 3 years earlier and he decided, at that time, the only solution was to kill innocent people.  To understand the mind of a depressed person you really need some education on how to watch for the signs that they are not well.  Then you need to get them help, if possible, and then notify authorities if it looks like they are doing something sinister.  Depressed people stay up all night thinking how to plan and execute their sinister plot.  I suggest anyone who knows someone who is diagnosed with depression to educate yourself so you understand the signs to watch for when they are about to rage, and protect your family.  His spouse had no idea what he was up to and I sincerely doubt she knew anything about depression unless someone in her immediate family was depressed.  This is a textbook case on depression and what can happen when the signs are ignored.  It's so sad and my heart goes out to all the victims and their families.

Opportunity. \n\nThere is no logical argument for why these people should be stripped of their lives and sent to foreign countries to start their lives over.\n\nLAWS are vague and malleable. Laws can be changed and have been changed through the centuries. We just have to change the laws, again, in order to do what is right. Just like we have done over the centuries to ban slavery, allow women to vote, end jim crow laws and improve the copyright laws. Gun laws need to be revised too. It's too easy for crazy people to get their hands on assault rifles...\n\nAnyways, people that argue against daca people are either envious and selfish entitled people who can't stand seeing brown people succeed, people deluding themselves that laws are absolute, ironclad - commandments(uniformed folk), or racist people.\n\nDon't come at me with this \"the law is the law\" BS. I've already explained that laws can be and have been changed(within reason) therefore they're not absolute.",

    "*LA RAZA* = \"Latino KKK\"\n\nCriticism[edit]\nC\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez was a critic of La Raza, stating to Peter Matthiessen of The New Yorker, \"\u201cI hear more and more Mexicans talking about la raza\u2014to build up their pride. Some people don\u2019t look at it as racism, but when you say \u2018La Raza,\u2019 you are saying an anti-gringo thing, and it won\u2019t stop there. Today it\u2019s anti-gringo, tomorrow it will be anti-Negro. We had a stupid guy who just wanted to play politics with the union, and he began to whip up La Raza against the white volunteers, and even had some of the farm workers and the pickets and the organizers hung up on La Raza. So I took him on. These things have to be met head on. On discrimination, I don\u2019t even give the members the privilege of a vote, and I\u2019m not ashamed of it. No, the whole business of discrimination can\u2019t exist here. So often, these days, the leaders are afraid, and even though they feel strongly against racism, they will not speak out against it. If the leadership is united, then it can say, \u2018All right, if you\u2019re going to do things that way, then you\u2019ll have to get rid of us.\u2019 You have to speak out immediately, the first time.\"[13]\n\nCh\u00e1vez friend and UFW staffer LeRoy Chatfield[14] stated, \"\"That's one of the reasons (Ch\u00e1vez) is so upset about La Raza. The same Mexicans that ten years ago were talking about themselves as Spaniards are coming on real strong these days as Mexicans. Everyone should be proud of what they are, of course, but race is only skin-deep. It's phony and it comes out of frustration; the la raza people are not secure. They look upon Cesar as their 'dumb Mexican' leader; he's become their saint. But he doesn't want any part of it. He said to me just the other day, 'Can't they understand that that's just the way Hitler started?' A few months ago the Ford Foundation funded a la raza group and Cesar really told them off. The foundation liked the outfit's sense of pride or something, and Cesar tried to explain to them what the origin of the word was, that it's related to Hitler's concept.\"[15][16]\n\nRichard Garcia quotes Chavez as stating, \"La Raza? Why be racist? Our belief is to help everyone, not just one race. Humanity is our belief.\" and noted Stan Steiner[17] as observing that when Chavez told Chicanos this, \"their faces fell\" in disbelief. They had thought he was a nationalist, not a humanist.\"[18][19][20]\n\nSome critics, such as conservative talk radio host George Putnam, call NCLR exclusionary in its approach to civil rights.[21] Republican congressman Charlie Norwood of Georgia's ninth district criticized congressional earmarking of four million dollars for NCLR housing initiatives.[22] Anti-illegal immigration websites, such as American Patrol, and anti-immigration websites, such as The American Resistance, accuse NCLR of encouraging illegal immigration to the United States.[23] Former Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-CO) referred to the group as the \"Latino KKK\".[24]",

    "For those interested, here is a very detailed explanation of the Russian hacks into both the DNC and RNC (failed hack) and how they did it -- before they even knew Trump was in the race for President.\nFrom Sovereign Man (compliments of Simon Black):\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s certain in the intelligence business, it\u2019s that there\u2019s rarely any certainty. \n\nThat\u2019s pretty much the first thing they teach you at spy school. \n\nBack in the early days of my intelligence career, I had one instructor who explained it in a way that I\u2019ll never forget. \n\n\u201cIf you present your analysis as if it\u2019s fact, instead of conjecture, the person who\u2019s relying on your intelligence could end up making a bad decision that gets people killed.\u201d \n\nIntelligence is not about definitive conclusions. It\u2019s about gathering data and coming up with plausible theories that connect the dots. \n\nSadly, sometimes those theories are influenced by personal or political agendas. \n\nBack in 2002-2003, the Bush White House had a pretty clear predisposition that Iraq possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs). \n\nMiraculously, the intelligence reports conformed to that narrative. \n\nAnd America went to war based on an \u201cunassailable conclusion\u201d from the intelligence community that Iraq had WMDs. \n\nThe facts were largely bogus, circumstantial at best. But this became the rallying cry behind every politician and media outlet\u2019s patriotic bloodlust. \n\nHow quickly they all forget. \n\nHere we are today with a new assertion: those dastardly Russians hacked Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). \n\nI read it in the New York Times, so it must be true. \n\nOnce again there is a chorus of condemnation from the intelligence community and political establishment based on supposed rock-solid conclusions. \n\nYet once again the assertions are nothing more than theories that connect some very circumstantial dots. \n\nHere\u2019s the actual evidence: \n\nThe hacks were executed using two types of malware known as Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. \n\n(Yes that\u2019s what they\u2019re actually called.) \n\nFancy Bear is malware that takes a conventional \u201cphishing\u201d approach. \n\nA phishing attack is when a hacker creates a web page that\u2019s almost an exact copy of one that you\u2019re used to. \n\nFor example, they\u2019ll create a website that looks like your bank\u2019s login page. \n\nSo if you click on a malicious link in your email that takes you to the fake page, you\u2019ll inadvertently supply a hacker with your bank username and password. \n\nThey\u2019ll then use that information to compromise your bank account. \n\nFancy Bear allowed hackers to gain access to private emails\u2026 primarily because the users at the DNC got duped into providing their login credentials. \n\nCozy Bear is the second piece of malware that installs itself on a computer, typically after a user clicks on a malicious web link. \n\nOne installed, the Cozy Bear malware deploys Remote Access Tools (known as RATs), providing a remote hacker access to the machine and its files. \n\nIf, however, Cozy Bear finds that the machine has advanced security software that could detect the malware and cause problems for the RATs, Cozy Bear will self-terminate. \n\nSo the first thing to point out here is that the DNC (and potentially the people who were administering Hillary\u2019s private email server) weren\u2019t maintaining the latest security patches and updates on their systems. \n\nSomeone at the DNC clicked on a malicious web link that installed the malware, and it didn\u2019t self-terminate because they weren\u2019t bothering to use advanced security software. \n\nDuh. \n\nThis is a simple competence issue, and I\u2019m surprised it never came up in the news. \n\nMore importantly, Cozy Bear was used against the DNC as far back as summer 2015... as in just before, or right after, Donald Trump entered the race. \n\nSo it\u2019s hard for me to believe that Vladimir Putin was actively hacking the DNC to support a candidate that had barely (or not even yet) materialized. \n\nMost importantly, just because cybersecurity experts detected Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear doesn\u2019t mean that the Russians were behind the attacks. \n\nThese assertions aren\u2019t based on concrete facts; they\u2019re just speculating that Colonel Mustard did it in the library with the candlestick. \n\n(Apologies to our readers who are too young to have played Clue.) \n\nBut facts (or lack of facts) don\u2019t matter. \n\nWhenever something bad happens, the US government blames Russia\u2026 and everyone believes it without taking any time to question the evidence. \n\nIt\u2019s as if we\u2019re living in some lame espionage movie from the 1980s where the Russians are always the bad guys. \n\nLook, I have absolutely zero regard for the Russian government (as is the case with just about every country\u2019s government). \n\nBut I find it almost hilariously short-sighted how quickly everyone rushes to judgment against the Russians. Or the Chinese. Or the North Koreans. \n\nSure, maybe the Russians did it. And I\u2019m happy to believe that\u2019s the case once clear evidence is presented. \n\nBut it\u2019s worth acknowledging right now that their assertions are nowhere near conclusive. \n\nIt\u2019s not like this is the first time in US history that the federal government or one of its intelligence agencies could be wrong\u2026 or\u2026 <shudder> have a reason to lie. \n\nIt\u2019s notable that last week President Obama ordered the entire intelligence community to investigate the Russian hacks. \n\nGiven the Obama administration\u2019s numerous statements about the Russians\u2019 complicity, and the nonstop media coverage about the \u201cconclusive\u201d evidence, it\u2019s pretty clear that the outcome of the report is already pre-determined. \n\nJust like the Iraq/WMD analysis back in 2002-2003, this investigation is biased by the boss\u2019s predisposition that the Russians are guilty. \n\nWhat I find most disturbing, though, is how they can\u2019t let it go that the Russians influenced the election and manipulated voter sentiment. \n\nI\u2019m sure we can all appreciate that the hacks, no matter who perpetrated them, constitute criminal activity. \n\nBut the information that was released as a result of the hacks shined a painful and embarrassing spotlight on the inner workings of the corrupt political establishment. \n\nSo when the papers and politicians complain that the hacks influenced the election (as if the US government has never tried to influence a foreign election), they\u2019re really just whining that voters found out the truth. \n\nThey have that little respect for your dignity.",

So what the hell does that have to do with Trump himself?  Are we know saying that anytime a  foreign gov. is able to hack a political party and it's people, that their opponent is not legit., even though they themselves had nothing to do with it?  So what is it they want Trump to do?  Forfeit the election because the Russian's preferred him?  That makes no sense at all..  so now all that has to be done to disqualify a candidate is have their opponent hacked?  Why wouldn't the opponent then set up the hack themselves?  When it all comes down to it Podesta is a private citizen, the DNC is a political party, not part of the government itself, any more than the Green party is.

When they start saying they must protect the people from false histories as they are now news (meaning the end of free speech) you won't be for long. I'd start now and start with the books that tell the history, not ones that tell you what to think of it like many written today. Find old history books and you'll understand the significance of older books that tell the history without commentary which I might add are typically in perfect condition and very inexpensive.

It's criminal to see Trump trying to use the exact playbook Putin used to take over all sections of the Russian Government, using his handpicked Cabinet members. This is not Russia  !!!  Trump is ripping up the constitution to aid him in gaining power over all Federal Agencies which are by law separate from his control.  Sessions aiding Trump from the Justice Department is criminal, he is a stooge who has no integrity and has sold the Justice Department to Trump. To allow Trump to use the entire power of the Justice Department to crush all those who are investigating Trump, his Russian deals and Russian money laundering that built Trump's empire.   Trump is the Russian President of the United States, hand picked by Putin, installed with Russian money, aided by Russian computer hacking, and enabled by Trump's organized Russian campaign collusion.  \n   McCabe is now free to reveal all he knows ....completely unchained.  So too is every Federal employee watching Trump's act tonight.  This act, at this speed, was done also to try and discredit McCabe as a fully credible FBI witness, soon to testify in the the coming Federal case of Trump's obstruction of justice by firing Comey.  McCabe knows Trump was trying to hide his Russian collusion by firing Comey.  \n  This attempt by the corrupt Trump administration will not stand.

It's a Trump FUCK YOU...now plainly seen by all American's.  Trump will never be able to wash of the stench of this outright hatred, this cowardly act.  Trump is not a president, he is an insane TV host acting out his own script to destroy all those he sees are attacking him ...his paranoid mind demented in delusion, led by fear, conjured by ignorant fantasy. Trump is not fit to lead this nation.  His outright acts to aid Russia, not stop Russian hacking, and refuse to stop Russia's destroying this nations fabric is treasonous.

    "According to Trump, Obama did little to stop the Russian intrusion that started during his term. Yet, Trump refuses to do anything or even admit to the Russian still doing this bcuz that somehow links him to collusion",
    "Well thats a positive. Trump has no reason not to sign sanctions on Russia to be enforced. Him not doing that will only give the opposition more ammo. His own party is saying \"yes they did and yes they hacked the DNC server\". Not to hurt or help anyone i guess idk. Balls in Trumps court now. If he dossnt sign sanctions then hes saying yea their findings vindicate me but the findings they found on them interferring still arent true.....",
    "An investigation to find evidence? Isn't that backwards? Doesn't evidence trigger the investigation, which then results in a finding? And if not, then its not an investigation, its a witch hunt. So what triggered the \"investigation\". Democratic lies and propaganda spewed by the Clinton machine, wasting millions of taxpayer dollars. While the real collusion has been going on for years with the Clintons.",

    "The meeting with Putin will be a non-event, at least from the perspective of getting anything from Russia. Putin is in a strong position as evidenced by going against the U.S. strong arm tactics against Equador at the WHO. Of course, most Trump fans have no idea what I'm talking about as they tend not to keep up with current events. At any rate, Russia was quick to show it's willingness to stand up to the U.S.\n\nWhy is this? Well, for one thing, the trade war thing has helped Russia and weakened our ability to get Russia to change via sanctions because We have opened up trading opportunities. For example, soybeans - China is now getting its soybeans from Brazil (at higher cost) and now Russia - in exchange for cold hard cash. The result is Russia doesn't give a whit about U.S. sanctions.",

    "Of course we need to maintain open channels of communication. Trump needs to keep Putin on a tight leach. You can smile and shake hands all you want but remembering that he is the  enemy and would love nothing more than to sink this country to the abyss. Meddling in our elections to create chaos and disrupt our way of democracy is a form of terrorism. Of course the great Obummer was doing the same in Israel. Hang them both.",
    "Trump is not intelligent and is a puppet for Putin, but that does not matter because that is the fact and will never change.\u00a0 What does matter is that 40 percent of Americans do not care about this.\u00a0 That is what is really really scary.",

Sessions met with Russians, Don Junior met with Russians, Michael Flynn met with Russians, Michael Cowen met with Russians and the list goes on and on. They all did it during the campaign and lied about it! Why? The FBI and all the intelligence agencies warned Trump about the Russia threat and he denounced it Publicly until he was pressured by Republicans to do otherwise! Why? He literally just a few weeks ago begged for Russia to be part of the G7 summit even though they were kicked out for invading Ukraine. Why? Putin hates NATO and Trump is the only American President to threaten to leave NATO and all International agreements that Putin hates! Why?  Guilty much? This is his only way to get more talking points from Putin. America is already sold to the Russians",

And the Finlies here love you and we love you; you're a wonderful world leader for your Russian people.  I think people misunderstand when airliners get shot down, or nations get invaded but these are things from the past. And I want to say that this is the strongest we have ever been with our Russian friends, even more than in World War II.  And I mean that.  And let me also say that I don't believe anyone in Russia has meddled with our elections and certain groups just have sour grapes.  That's an American expression.  \"Sour grapes\".  It means Hillary lost <chuckles>.   I will leave it to Jared to work with your wonderful representatives on some projects we have and I hope those go well.  Together we can spread real peace -- not fake peace, like the fake news media.  Like CNN.  Or MSNBC.  Not real like Fox and your own Pravda.

I also believe that put America 1st and take care of Americans 1st for America's own greatness of security and safety, only America's own security and safety will better take care of America's own prosperity and unity by America's own patriotism and loyalty.

If the medias can't keep secret of America's own policies or decisions and will spread words all over in the world, our Gov't may should keep the mouth shut for America's own greatness of security and safety issues, because this will subject to America's own greatness immediately.

Some of the judges that presently serve the Supreme Court are elderly, might retire or could pass away, all within the time frame of the next presidents administration. If Hillary Clinton is elected, she will appoint nothing but extremely liberal leftist nominees & then our rights will be stripped from us one by one. This fact alone should be enough to want our next president to be somewhat conservative. We have to do everything we can to save our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and our country.",

    "Nothing irritates me more than the standard pseudo-nonpartisan rhetorical tap dancing of the career politician. After 30+ years, the politician's filter gets old a shit. Although up until 2 or 3 years ago I was pretty much liberal. Perhaps it had something to do with my religious upbringing. I am considered an apostate now because I left it behind.\n\nIt was the typical high control group. They have an allegiance code and maintain a strict abstinence policy from political affiliation. Presumably, I unconsciously felt at home in the democratic party. It reminded me of the high control religious cult I grew up in. They even use the same bullshit excuses. The Organization did not want their followers becoming unevenly yoked by unnecessary association with their competition. Kinda like going to a restaurant: You can either have Pepsi or Coke. You cannot sell both under one roof or else the universe implodes from a conflict of interest. Sounds familiar, right?\u00a0\n\nThat's the shit right there that would eventually turn me against the democratic party just like it did Dubland. It didn't take long to realize there was something deeply wrong with this movement.\u00a0A lot of these progressive clowns don't give a shit about free speech.\u00a0For the first time in my entire life I was actually intrigued by the republican debate. If you can even call it that. I only watched the damn thing because of Donald Trump. The primary reason for this being that I had come to expect nothing new from the right or the left.\u00a0\n\nOne way or another, political and religious affiliations unavoidably become fundamentally anchored into our psyche in much the same kind of way people do for religion. One of the most obvious symptoms in common between the two is how it influences us. The way we talk to each other about our political views, \u00a0--- or, more specifically in this case, how we effectively mastered the art of public speaking which uses words in such a way where basically nobody says a God damn thing.\u00a0\n\nThis is why I like Donald Trump. He's not a fucking pussy. Don\u2019t say the wrong thing. You might hurt somebody\u2019s feelings, or even worse you could slip up and say something honest. God forbid. You know what this reminds me of? This is basically the same language of a beta male who is in an abusive relationship with the entirety of their constituency.\n\nApparently, battered beta male syndrome has become an epidemic in politics nowadays. Whatever the real issues are, they are buried deep down underneath all the layers of bullshit language that keeps us thinking about the surface, instead of the unidentified cognitive cancer growing in the minds of educated fools. And yet, now my conservative mom has turned against Fox news, and her liberal son likes a GOP candidate? Seriously, WTF is going on? If there is a God, and you're reading this comment, now you are just showing off.\u00a0\n\n #politics \u00a0 #gop \u00a0 #donaldtrump \u00a0\u00a0 #democrats",

    "Here's something I've been pondering for a long time. We have a stand your ground law which tells us that if you're in fear of serious personal injury or death that you're entitled to stand your ground which is another way of saying you're entitled to defend yourself. Let's say you saw that pickup truck speeding toward you and it so happened that you might be a legal gun owner with a gun in your pocket. As you were overcome with a fear of impending death you took out your gun and you shot the driver dead thereby avoiding getting killed. Could this be a legitimate stand-your-ground defense?",

THIS MEANS THAT YOU CAN FIT A SEMI TRACTOR AND TRAILER BETWEEN YOU AND VEHICLE IN FRONT OF YOU.",
    "I'd like to see the pickup driver's phone and what he was doing at the time that took his attention away from the road.  Yes, texting and driving.  I said it.  I mean it.  He was engrossed in something that allowed him to NOT avoid the collision.  Not impaired?  You do not have to be drunk or on drugs to be impaired.  This tragedy could have been avoided.\n\nAnd, re teens blowing stop signs.  If you are taught to NOT blow stop signs and why, the accident wouldn't have happened.  Children follow by example.

Jesus, quickly reveal yourself to us, that is best for each one of us, touch us the only place that you know and can touch, Jesus can you not minister individually to each person, the only way that they can be ministered to,. Jesus are you not greater than any and all calamity and evil, Jesus where a man sees no way out, your spirit testifies that you Jesus, you are the only way out. Jesus you are the author and finisher of all things, great and small. Jesus help us receive your perfect and perfecting love and forgiveness of the cross. Jesus you told me that if we could fully receive and understand the love and forgiveness of the cross, we would be transformed as a new spirit, a useful witness for Christ Jesus. Jesus we pray that you answer this prayer, that we receive THE FULL PORTION,of your perfect love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ.Jesus we praise your perfect love and forgiveness. Jesus we pray for personal and professional revival Lord Jesus not only does it have to happen in our heart, it has to happen in our family and in our workplace,,, Lord bring us to where your people are, there's no greater ministry then in our own families in our own workplace, Jesus show us the way to your fullness. Jesus you said, to pray for the greatest gift to prophesy to strengthen, encourage and comfort our people, to help raise them up. Jesus we repent of godless chatter, a lack of faith. Jesus we need the faith the size of a mustard seed to plant our faith at the altar,Jesus you will grow our faith.

Jesus we pray for this great awakening, correction, direction pointing to Christ Jesus, as Lord and Savior. The name of Jesus is above all names, the name of Jesus identifies the God we serve, the God that can save, forgive us of our sins, and love us into eternity now and forever. Jesus cannot the zeal of the Lord accomplish this great revival, harvest this great harvest and free our people, from captivity of the world and the evil one. Jesus not all is lost, but always gained, we hear that this is the greatest time and harvest, that the world will ever see. Jesus, Jesus, quickly come. Jesus we are standing in victory and not in defeat, because the victory was won on the cross let us praise your great name the name above all names, Christ Jesus our Savior and Lord, amen and amen.

    "Tell me again why this President is given an A+ rating by his base and the Republican party? So far, that wall isn't being built. Just a bunch of useless prototypes that still haven't passed certain specs and hardly in the process of moving forward. Also, wasn't Mexico supposed to pay for this wall? Last time I heard, Trump is asking Congress for $18 billion in funding the project. By the way. When a President request funding for any policy to go into effect....The American taxpayer is actually funding the wall. And with those Trump Tax Cuts....You're not saving money, but dishing more out. That was the scheme. Cut your taxes, so your dumb downed enough to pay for his stupid wall. Then there's the appeal of ObamaCare. Which millions of people count on for affordable medical insurance. The same ObamaCare that thousands of Trump supporters need and still want in their economic deprived lives. Even if Trump and the Republicans appeal the Affordable Care Act. There's no alternative in place. Which means this country goes back to square one, right back to the drawing board. Tell me again why his a winner. Because so far. As an Independent. He seems to be losing in all aspects. No major pieces of legislation has been passed. And you can't blame the  Democraps. Especially since Redumblicans control both chambers in Congress. So there's no excuse on why effective and progressive policies should pass through the House and Senate. Also, why hasn't Trump released his tax returns like promised? Why hasn't he stepped down from his business interest? Why is still pulling in an illegal profit through his companies? Especially since he's supposed to \"paying\" attention to American values, principles, and concerns. Instead of getting himself paid in full. Why did he lie about not taking a vacation while in office. It seems any chance he gets. Trump rather play golf, at his private resort. If you want to make an impact as President. You must be in the White House, inside the Oval Office.....That's how policy is initiated. By the way. Trump has played more round of golf than Obama. Even though Trump promised to not golf at all. Why is Trump still taking a Presidential salary? He told us on the campaign trail he would fork over his salary to a charity of the American People's choosing. I'm not a Republican. Nor am I a Democrat. Because the Republicans are a party of really bad ideas. Democrats are a party of no ideas or have no idea what they're doing. Trump was supposed to be the Master of the Deal. But turnt out to be the Master of the Steal. And another puppet. But not a puppet of some corporate empire....He's an agent or entity of some foreign government. Trump is Putin's Puppet.

Bottom line, poverty will ALWAYS be just a few cent below minimum wage, even if minimum is $40.00 an hour would mean that poverty is $38.00 an hour. Minimum wage sets the scale for poverty. If you want $8.00 a gallon for milk, $4.50 for a dozen eggs, and $7.50 Happy meals then raise minimum wage to $26.00 an hour!!!!\nI'll say the biggest driving force to inflation would be $7.50 Happy meals.",

    "Nicely taken out of context and blown out of proportion. The kind of fear mongering Fox is very good at. What really happened is that the level of radiation is measured inside the reactor core, to see what is needed to remove the fuel from the core. Inside a reactor core the radiation is always this high, and it is the first time since the meltdown they were able to see inside the reactor without causing the radiation to further escape. The radioactive water that is being released contains mostly isotopes that have a very short half life and will decay into harmless elements before it can spread around the world. And yes, radiation from more long-lived isotopes from Fukushima has been found around the world. But these are litteraly traces which could be measured in parts per billion. This means it is so dilute, it does not really do any harm. Instead of this fear mongering, Fox would do well to focus on the disaster fossil fuels are causing across the world. Just burning coal alone kills 13,000 people in the US annually. That is only from air pollution and does not even include the effects of climate change induced weather patterns. Statistically fossil energy generation is therefore thousands of times worse than nuclear for the environment and people.",

What we do; is use 20 or more of them to create a mega sinkhole deep enough under the entire Fukishima complex. Dig in a circular pattern well enough below the radiation and water table to dig a mega manmade sinkhole; support the TEPCO plant until time is ready and not contaminate the project below.  Save the un contaminated tailings to be used lated as top soil to cover and replace the ruined outlying areas contaminated top soil. When the sink hole is enormous enough to swallow the whole plant reactors and all. Plant explosive charges in stages underneath with supporting properly sequenced tunnels. It needs to be at least 5000 feet deep and wide enough to swallow it whole irradiated mess. Sink the entire plant; reactors and all into the sink hole. Then take the surrounding areas contaminated soil and fill in the top. Issues of ground water and sea waters probably do no exist at the deeper levels. Make it deep and mega large enough.

We can wear radiation suits when we go outdoors so we can stay alive long enough to try to save the planet, take zeolite to detox the radiation, and eat only organic food grown inside the domes so we can live a while longer and save our children to perhaps repair the world.

We have several issues that are ongoing and crucial to our prosperity and security: our open border and the wall, the gun control issue, the economic disparities with our trading partners, to name but a few.  Why not have each party take a solid stance and put it before the voters for there to be an honest debate and clear understanding of the different stances.  That said, I don't know if anyone in American politics today even has the capability to honestly take a stance and either defend of promote it without vacillating with the constantly changing public opinion polls.  I am thoroughly disgusted with both parties, but the Democrats actually scare me - everything they supposedly stand for inevitably leads to the further destruction of our nation.",

    "meow says to fox news thus : its time to talk about freedoms & Lack of freedoms of religions again ; but this time not the types of religions you'd normally think of! & its time to advertise for the new anime manga Blu-ray DVD & DVD named : \" hyper definition neptunia \" story series with this as possibly the new currency bible for wallstreet and stock brokers and everyone into currencies! why? answer : because this story series as sinfull and as trouble making and controversial as it most really truly is : it seems to help exsplaine how the stock markets succeed and fail sort of once its decoded and translated correctly! how will Jewish abelite creator who art in heavens in Jewish Jesus of nazareth's holy divine names deal with and react to this should be the real concern whether such a deity will help save some of this or send disasters so enormous to cause it all to be destroyed like the legendary lost city of Atlantic is the real question here internationally world wide! & here's why & answer is thus: hyper dimensional Neptune & hyper dimensional neptunia story series also talking about folks beliefs &/or lack of beliefs in their goddesses & which ones of on & off variable switches with limited possible supplies of such equals shares equals currency flows community sharing &/ or nonstuckness &/or equals anti-shares equals currency nonflows hoardings &/or savings &/or individuality &/or greed &/or stuckness! & both equals stock markets & stock exchanges & wallstreet & Nasdaq & etc., & buying & selling! & folks equals customers & goddesses equals merchant businesses & also equals merchant corporations! but some folks also describe currencies not just as belief systems but also describe currencies as votes & buying & selling also equals votes some say as another form of communication! so! this also means thus: so sorry! no currency nor tech nor etc., if you are not part ocean sea fish! 2 main groups types of shares and anti-shares exist! group #1:nexus self unification blue hearted quantum anti-null do no harm Albert Einstein's god does not play dice cored clusters unifies yang,yin,&yong blue hearts systems into one operating system! yang =dominant white quantum anti-null shares blue hearted! yin=dominant black quantum anti-null anti-shares blue hearted! yong =dominant Grey equivalent unto a permenant magnet quantum anti-null shares&anti-shares combos blue hearted! however; on the more fatal potentially destructive deadly sides also exists: nexus red hearted colored self unification quantum null cored clusters that unifies all of the red hearted systems into a single operating system of yang,yin,&yong! yang = dominant white quantum null shares red colored hearted! yin=dominant black quantum null anti-shares red colored hearted! yong=dominant Grey equivalent unto a permenant magnet quantum null shares & anti-shares combos red colored hearted! so therefore : what you should all do is to contact Israel to contact their abelite god & goddess in heavens for you about this comment & about how to restructure and redefine & thoroughly safety engineer all merchant and currency and economic and etc organizations and businesses and operating life support systems clusters and laws and methods and life styles and etc within reason so that it works and succeeds and supports everyone despite differences imperially democratically and democratically and so it saves more lives than it mass exstinct and so it does not upset the god and goddess abelite who art in heavens type of god of Israel so that deity will not come to destroy it all with giant disaster floods of wraith and grief and so peaceful coexistence with you & that particular deity always occurs! & I do not control nor cause that deity nor that deity's disasters to occur! so also ask how such should be changed so such does not disobey nor displease that deity and him/her laws and rules so you all might be spared with your currencies and businesses and democratic freedoms and way of life within reason while you still can before its too late to do so & hopefully correctly politely nicely in such a way that will not cause such a deity to mass exstinct you all in a mere blink of an eye where you stand &/or sit &/or lay &/or exist! I can not and will not force such a deity to do what he/she refuses to do &/or can not do and/ or can not accept &/or can not comprehend &/or etc.,! you are being warned and told truth of this hopefully! ask Israel's rabbi to ask their god of Abraham of Israel the meaning and purpose of this comment and to exsplaine it unto you all in terms and forms you can comprehend and accept correctly! & if you want to live! & if you do not want to live any more just ignore this comment and await time of your death if not far worse I guess maybe?!? but merchant businesses & corporations in place of and replacing gods and goddesses?!? Isn't that just a little bit scary terrifying unto you all if not enormously so that you never want to allow nor permit that to occur maybe?!? & see? I did tellyou didn't I that this was an unusual topic comment on religion now didn't I? so you are still not interested in saving religious freedoms that could also save your merchant businesses also? & if not why not? well ; at least think about it! well ; good luck! bye bye! signed meow.",

After their expulsion, the \"Israeli Forces\" totally obliterated (usually by bulldozing) 385 Arab villages and towns, out of a total of 475. Commonly, Israeli villages were built on the remaining rubble. \n\n\nJanuary 1, 1948. Haganah terrorists attacked a village on the slopes of Mount Carmel; 17 Arabs were killed and 33 wounded.  \n\n\nJanuary 7, 1948. Seventeen Arabs were killed by a bomb at the \nJaffa Gate in Jerusalem, 3 of them while trying to escape. Further casualties, including the murder of a British officer near Hebron, were reported from different parts of the country.  \n\n\nJanuary 16, 1948. Zionists blew up three Arab buildings. In the first, 8 children between the ages of 18 months and 12 years, died.  \n\n\nFebruary 15, 1948. \nHaganah terrorists attacked an Arab village near Safad, blew up several houses, killing 11 Arabs, including 4 children..  \n\n\nApril 19, 1948. Fourteen Arabs were killed in a house in Tiberias, which was blown up by Zionist terrorists.",

    "Chinese Military Scientists Have Infiltrated \"Five Eyes\" Western Universities\n\nby Tyler Durden\nMon, 10/29/2018 - 18:45\n\nApproximately 2,500 researchers from Chinese military universities have infiltrated Western universities over the past decade, focusing on the so-called \"Five Eyes\" group of countries, reports the Financial Times, citing a new report from Australian government-funded think tank, the Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).\nAccording to the report, many of the Chinese researchers failed to disclose their military affiliations, while publishing a large volume of joint papers with Western scientists which can help Beijing's technological ambitions. \n    Over the past five years, researchers affiliated to the People\u2019s Liberation Army published more joint papers with scientists from the UK and the US than with those of any other country.\n    The findings will fuel the debate raging in some western capitals over how to control the flow of cutting-edge and especially dual-use technology to Beijing \u2014 one of the main fronts in their struggle to adapt to a rapidly rising China.\n    The PLA\u2019s international research collaboration \u201cfocuses on hard sciences, especially emerging and dual-use technologies\u201d, said Alex Joske, author of the report that is being published by ASPI today. Dual-use technology has civilian and military applications. -Financial Times\nJoske found that the most dominant areas for collaboration between Chinese and foreign researchers were navigation technology, computer science and artificial intelligence (AI). \n    In one example, several researchers visited UK universities and are continuing joint research on topics such as combustion in scramjet engines, which could power hypersonic aircraft capable of flying at six times the speed of sound. Wang Zhenguo, deputy chief of the PLA\u2019s scramjet programme and head of the department of postgraduate studies at the NUDT, has co-authored 18 papers with foreign scientists. -Financial Times\nAnother Scramjet researcher and aircraft design expert for the PLA's General Armaments Department, Huang Wei, worked on his PhD while at the University of Leeds between 2008 and 2010, according to a researcher at the UK university. Another Chinese scramjet expert, Luo Wenlei, wrote his PhD thesis on scramjet engines while at Leeds in 2014. Both Luo and Huang along with Luo's doctoral thesis supervisors have published together with Gen Wang on the scramjet technology. \n    Qin Ning, a professor at the University of Sheffield involved in some of the exchanges with Chinese scramjet experts, said their joint research was fundamentally academic in nature. \u201cI have not [been] involved in military related research myself or with the visitors while they [were] at Sheffield. Similarly the visitors [were not] involved in military related research while in Sheffield,\u201d Prof Qin said.\n    He added that a number of EU-China collaborative projects strongly encouraged by the university \u2014 with the participation of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which is administered by the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence, China\u2019s weapons industry regulator \u2014 had produced \u201cfruitful collaboration\u201d. -Financial Times\nOne of the most commonly pushed collaborations has come from the PLA's Rocket Force - which includes Beijing's nuclear weapons and missile programs. One of the leading Chinese missile experts, Major General Hu Changhua, spent three months at Germany's University of Duisburg-Essen in 2008, while another RFEU lecturer, Zhou Zhijie, was a visiting scholar at the University of Manchester in 2009. Both Changhua and Zhijie concealed their afficilation with RFEU and instead named the Xi'an Research Institute of High Technology - which doesn't exist. The two continue to publish in English based on this falsified affiliation, according to entries in digital science publication databases. \nThe professors in question either did not respond for comment, or denied working directly for the PLA: \n    Liu Ling, a professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Computing who works on big data and cloud computing, has co-published papers with scientists from the NUDT according to the digital library of IEEE, a scientists\u2019 association.\n    She told the FT that her work with NUDT visiting scholars \u201chas been on pure (fundamental) research\u201d and unrelated to military applications, adding: \u201cWhile I am not familiar with all of Georgia Tech collaborations, I know for sure that I have never worked with PLA directly\u201d. -Financial Times\nThat, according to defense experts, is splitting hairs. While many of those employed by PLA-affiliated universities are so-called \"civilian cadres\" who focus on science not intended for combat, they are still members of the PLA, while NUDT is supervised by China's governing military body, the Central Military Commission. In 2015 the US government added NUDT to a list of organizations which require a more thorough vetting before licensing the transfer of any item to them, including technology, under the Export Administration Regulations. \nMeanwhile, in February FBI Director Christopher Wray informed the Senate Intelligence Committee that Chinese intelligence operatives have infiltrated American universities, \u201cwhether its professors, scientists, students;\u201d the FBI must launch surveillance operations from its fifty-six field offices to monitor the situation. Wray emphasized that China is determined to dethrone the United States as a global superpower through unconventional means. He framed the infiltration as both a governmental and a societal threat to the American empire.\n    \"One of the things we're trying to do is view the China threat as not just a whole-of-government threat, but a whole-of-society threat on their end\"\nSpeaking before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Wray discussed the infiltration of Chinese operatives at America\u2019s most prestigious academic institutions - adding that the vast network of Chinese operatives are very concerning and requires participation from all of the FBI\u2019s field offices across the country. Specifically, Wary stated that the FBI is \u201cwatching\u201d programs at dozens of Confucius Institutes, funded by China\u2019s Ministry of Education that are widely embedded within American universities and public schools to teach the Mandarin language.\nThe Confucius Institute program, which started operations in 2004, has been the subject of vast criticisms, concerns, and controversies during its international expansion. Many such concerns stem from the program\u2019s close relationship to the Communist Party of China.\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, some 350,000 Chinese students are actively enrolled at American universities, which is about thirty-five percent of the one million foreigners, said the Institute of International Education.\nWray describes China\u2019s approach to weaken the U.S. from within. Its \u201cnontraditional collectors\u201d of intelligence and technology, have not just been in the business community of stealing patents but now the disease has infected academia.\n    \u201cI think the level of naivete on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues. They\u2019re exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere. But they\u2019re taking advantage of it,\u201d Wray said.\nOver the course of a decade, China\u2019s Ministry of Education through its proxy of Confucius Institutes has embedded itself into more than 100 public and private universities, colleges, and even high schools in the United States. What is even more astonishing is that several hundred more Confucius Classrooms teach Mandarin at elementary, middle and high schools across the country.\nSo far, the Chinese appear to be in the process of systematically dismantling the American empire without firing a shot.",

    "Follow my reasoning...  It's too coincidental that Feinstein and Dr. Ford both live in the Bay Area.  Secondly, Brett Kavanaugh's mother, Judge Martha presided in a foreclosure case for Dr. Ford's parents in the mid 1990's.   It is said that Dr. Ford's brother is somehow connected to Fusion GPS.   Dr. Ford never mentioned this alleged event until 2012 during couples counseling.   Dr. Ford is a liberal democrat professor who has been politically active.  Finally, Feinstein sat on the letter for nearly two months.    So now we have some ingredients to this stew.    It surely would be more believable if Dr. Ford lived in say the Mid-West, had no prior past parental connection (the foreclosure) was a independent or even a republican and she immediately stepped up to the plate with her accusation,  immediately wanting to discredit Judge Kavanaugh.  The entire thing stinks of being contrived, planned and pre-mediated.    Here's what I think.  Either Dr. Ford called Feinstein or someone under Feinstein full well knowing that she would be the perfect foil to unseat Kavanaugh or Feinstein's office contacted Dr. Ford after a computer run of possible women who would be an ideal accuser, the choose the former.   She's a Ph.D.  she's no dummy.   Dr. Ford must know about a term called transference, that is to say some horrible event did indeed happen when Dr. Ford was a teen but the boy wasn't Brett Kavanaugh.  It's rather easy to substitute another person into a long term past event, and even believe it was that other person!   \nThe manner in which Feinstein and Dr. Ford heralded the announcement is very suspicious.   It's my belief it was very carefully discussed, planned and executed.   I'd be amazed Brett Kavanaugh was the molester, now there's a chance, anything is possible, but given the way this all has been handled and with the facts presented at the beginning of this comment,  I think not.",

A generic, fake, pile of BS the Democrats hashed up in a shameless and desperate attempt to keep Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court. It's so blatantly obvious (including obvious to the Democrats,) how all of this was fabricated to do just that! However they also know their delay tactics are an effort in futility, and that Kavanaugh will very likely be confirmed. But not without a little laundry stain to take along with him. A stain put there, put there among the filth within the Democratic party. Who no doubt will continue to spew forth that filth in an effort to impeach him should they take control of the House and/or, Senate.",

    "Grassley was right that Schumer is the conductor here along with Dem strategist at the very top of their food chain. It doesn't take a lawyer to see that she did not agree to Grassley's offer with deadline of 10 pm.

Her lawyer knows these weasel claws items include things that Grassley can't agree to.\n\nThey will keep playing this game as long as they can.  Grassley should know every time he allows a deadline to go by without an agreement not subject to further negotiations; that any of his subsequent deadlines have less and lesss meaning.  The Dems goal is a drawn out series of last minute quasi agreement but asking for more time to work out the details. They know at some point Grassley will have to stop moving the deadlines out and have a vote. \n\nThat way the Dems can try to get out their vote based on how it was all \"rushed\" when the intention was to not have her testify.  Unfortunately Grassley knows that no matter how many times he moves the vote out, this it will play out the same way.  They will always say it was rushed.

And that goes for ANY police report, past and present, to show a record of the case.

    "ALL: This whole situation of ducking and dodging is not only appalling, it appears to have become far too hideously common for members of the GOP,  Republicans,Conservatives, etc.  Now, on national and international stages, we  observe how the GOP are using the old, slight of hands technique---quickly cover all genuine points lest the truth makes more sense, overlook and suppress anything that looks like truth and call it fake and false, make fun of the people who are victims of abuse and of these politicians' egregious conducts.  Sadly, there is seemingly a host of naive GOP/Republican folks out there who assume that just because they dictate moral values, this will protect them if and when they themselves are dishonest.  Personally, I see what the Republicans in this particular instance are doing appears to be: 1.They are saying to victims of any and all kinds of sexual abuse, sexual violence, and domestic violence, etc that their voices don't count and that they should keep their mouths shut. 2.  They are suggesting that victims of sexual violence are inclined to lie, mis-remember,  stretch the truth.  3. They also seem to be reinforcing the value of the rich, powerful, elites over average citizens.  4. They appear to be placing value on 'life and pro-life' concepts without placing value on the actual lives of people. 5. Lastly, whether they want to acknowledge it or not, they are placing more importance on the policies they support be it tax cuts, corporate welfare, the removal of regulations, etc than citizens as humans. My question is:  If the allegations against Kavanaugh are false, WHY hasn't he requested a FBI investigation, a lie detector test,  or a more thorough process of review?",

If, as I believe, the claims are false then she should be charged appropriately.  If it is proven that Kavanaugh did sexually assault her then of course he should not be confirmed.

If I Was President I would not put them on a slow boat to China I would put them on the fastest jet that the United States of America has and have the military arrest them all in the middle of the night put them on the jet airplanes and drop them off over China.

The key for him is to always look directly into the eyes of the person questioning him when he gives his answers and never look down, up or sideways as these are indications of lying. Actually, looking up to the left is okay because that's what people do when they're recalling something that actually happened.  Looking up the the right, however, means one is trying to recall their contrived story.",

No law or ruling is absolute.",

If you could just throw the accusation out there and have it accepted as gospels then would would be the point of our justice system?
