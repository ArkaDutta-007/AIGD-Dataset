    "David Frum picks up on something that was mentioned by David Cay Johnston, who wrote at least one book about Drumpf released not long before the 2016 election called \u201cThe Making of Donald Trump.\u201d Either in the book or in interviews discussing his book and his knowledge of Drumpf\u2019s history and various nefarious doings, which is quite extensive. Johnston discussed an instance in which he went down to Atlantic City, NJ to interview Drumpf and noted that all the other casino owners and operators down there said something that gave him pause. To a man they all claimed that Drumpf didn\u2019t know ANYTHING about the casino business, so Johnston put into his interview a planted false statement about a card game (can\u2019t remember exactly which one). Johnston was surprised to find out later Drumpf folded that inaccuracy into his later statements and conversations with people; cementing what he had believed about \u2018The Donald\u2019: that he was P.T. Barnum incarnate and that he was nothing more than a con man with a nice suit and a lot of daddy\u2019s money.\n\nFast forward to now, and Mr. Frum\u2019s comment matches Johnston\u2019s conclusion; Drumpf never studies up on anything...he just bullshits and wings it. Therefore, when fabricating his lies he is not always careful where he sources those \u201calternative facts\u201d from and he has been caught out on it whereas when he was just a real estate developer he wasn\u2019t under such an intense gaze by so many. If you fact-check ANYTHING he says I would hazard a guess probably only 1/4 or so of what he says is even relatable to him and not just his memory hearing someone say something.",

    "Trump is a lot like Hitler. He doesn't like Muslims, he wants to keep them out. He is buddy buddy with Russia, but has shown that he will attack (remember like 2 months ago when 2-300 Russian mercenaries were killed?) He says the media is fake news (Hitler said the same thing), Trump has a narrative that big companies are taking jobs to Mexico and stabbing our economy in the back (sound familiar?) And I honestly believe that Trump may be taking an \"upper\" of some kind. Keep in mind he's in 70's, and he has had the energy to hold campaign rallies back to back, and not to mention he seems very scatter brained, jumping from topic to topic and going off script. Not to mention his behaviour on Twitter (which is embarrassing. He should be doing things, not talking about them like a 15 year old.)",

    "Trump has no recollection about what people actually said to him because he doesn't listen to anyone.

    "You just have to catch Trump answering to any off guard questions and you see the real deal: First instinct is always \"wasn't me, who is to blame but me?\"\nnext attempt to deflect is \"other people do it, too\" or \"can you give waterproof evidence?\"\nand finally \"i'm president because they elected me and that justifies EVERYTHING\"\n\nthat is the chain of argument a psychopath serial killer and a dictator would use.

    "*Why is Vladimir Putin* so proud of Russia's prostitutes ? Apparently they are Russia's 2nd biggest export.   According to Comey's memo , on February 8, 2017 Trump told him that Putin declared - \u201cwe have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.\" . Well the Ruble has lost over 40% of it's value since 2014 and prostitution may be one of the biggest sources of employment for ordinary Russians .",

UPI is the second largest news gathering and polling service in the country.  Even Real Clear Politics leaves UPI out in its averaging all of the polls.  This is why the MSM -main stream media- like MSNBC cannot be trusted. All of you support the globalist new world order agenda and Hillary is the person that fits right in.  I'm not saying Trump is perfect, he most certainly isn't but he is an outsider to all of the globalist goings on in Washington and if he gets elected, there will be changes, and maybe not all the ones he talks about.

Lucky, yes.  But lack?  \"Hi, there, friend.  Did you know your department is lack?\"  This is a person who doesn't know the difference between _lax_ and _lack_ or thinks they are the same word, commenting on what he considers to be former Pres. Obama's legal issues.  Let that sink in.  This is not a typo in a hastily produced tweet; it is simply the wrong word with a different meaning than the one intended, clearly pronounced in a public statement made by the caller.  Neither Mr. Giuliani nor Mr. Sekulow correct him, so maybe they don't know the difference either. \"Oh, but you know what he meant.\"  Yes, I figured it out, but we are in an age when the president of the United States says \"would\" when he claims he was thinking \"wouldn't\" in Helsinki, so can we always be sure that we are processing the statement correctly when it says something that makes no sense?

It is a religion and any child can tell you that religious freedom is one of our Constitutional guarantees. No! It's the other things. We cannot afford to have Trump continue to steal from us at his current rate, especially given the fact that the economy is expected to at least flatten if not crash. He has been traitorous in the level of his disrespect for all of America and the American government. I believe that his criminal nature would have been sufficient that he would not have received a security clearance if he were not president.

No decent lawyer would represent him due to his lies, poor record of payment, and the fact that he doesn't listen to his attorney's advice.   Knowing that, Trump's effort to use trickery to escape his guilt of  conspiracies against America should be prosecuted against  him.   He's used the Office of Presidency to gain personal profits, he's working with Putin, a hostile enemy to America and he's a total disgrace.

Kissinger will remain in his Cabinet.\n\nThe President-to-be praised Mr. Nixon's sacrifice for the country and called it \"one of the vary saddest incidents that I've every witnessed.\"\n\nMr. Nixon said he decided he must resign when he concluded that he no longer had \"a strong enough political base in the Congress\" to make it possible for him to complete his term of office.\n\nDeclaring that he has never been a quitter, Mr. Nixon said that to leave office before the end of his term \" is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.\"\n\nBut \"as President, I must put the interests of America first,\" he said.\n\nWhile the President acknowledged that some of his judgments \"were wrong,\" he made no confession of the \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" with which the House Judiciary Committee charged him in its bill of impeachment.\n\nSpecifically, he did not refer to Judiciary Committee charges that in the cover-up of Watergate crimes he misused government agencies such as the FBI, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAfter the President's address, Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski issued a statement declaring that \"there has been no agreement or understanding of any sort between the President or his representatives and the special prosecutor relating in any way to the President's resignation.\"\n\nJaworski said that his office \"was not asked for any such agreement or understanding and offered none.\"\n\nHis office was informed yesterday afternoon of the President's decision, Jaworski said, but \"my office did not participate in any way in the President's decision to resign.\"\n\nMr. Nixon's brief speech was delivered in firm tones and he appeared to be complete control of his emotions. The absence of rancor contrasted sharply with the \"farewell\" he delivered in 1962 after being defeated for the governorship of California.\n\nAn hour before the speech, however, the President broke down during a meeting with old congressional friends and had to leave the room.\n\nHe had invited 20 senators and 26 representatives for a farewell meeting in the Cabinet room. Later, Sen. Barry M. Goldwater (R-Ariz.), one of those present, said Mr. Nixon said to them very much what he said in his speech.\n\n\"He just told us that the country couldn't operate with a half-time President,\" Goldwater reported. \"Then he broke down and cried and he had to leave the room. Then the rest of us broke down and cried.\"\n\nIn his televised resignation, after thanking his friends for their support, the President concluded by saying he was leaving office \"with this prayer: may God's grace be with you in all the days ahead.\"\n\nAs for his sharpest critics, the President said, \"I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me.\" He called on all Americans to \"join together . . . in helping our new President succeed.\"\n\nThe President said he had thought it was his duty to persevere in office in face of the Watergate charges and to complete his term.\n\n\"In the past days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort,\" Mr. Nixon said.\n\nHis family \"unanimously urged\" him to stay in office and fight the charges against him, he said. But he came to realize that he would not have the support needed to carry out the duties of his office in difficult times.\n\n\"America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress,\" Mr. Nixon said. The resignation came with \"a great sadness that I will not be here in this office\" to complete work on the programs started, he said.\n\nBut praising Vice President Ford, Mr. Nixon said that \"the leadership of America will be in good hands.\"\n\nIn his admission of error, the outgoing President said: \"I deeply regret any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision.\"\n\nHe emphasized that world peace had been the overriding concern of his years in the White House.\n\nWhen he first took the oath, he said, he made a \"sacred commitment\" to \"consecrate my office and wisdom to the cause of peace among nations.\"\n\n\"I have done my very best in all the days since to be true to that pledge,\" he said, adding that he is now confident that the world is a safer place for all peoples.\n\n\"This more than anything is what I hoped to achieve when I sought the presidency,\" Mr. Nixon said. \"This more than anything is what I hope will be my legacy to you, to our country, as I leave the presidency.\"\n\nNoting that he had lived through a turbulent period, he recalled a statement of Theodore Roosevelt about the man \"in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood\" and who, if he fails \"at least fails while daring greatly.\"\n\nMr. Nixon placed great emphasis on his successes in foreign affairs. He said his administration had \"unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a century stood between the United States and the People's Republic of China.\"\n\nIn the mideast, he said, the United States must begin to build on the peace in that area. And with the Soviet Union, he said, the administration had begun the process of ending the nuclear arms race. The goal now, he said, is to reduce and finally destroy those arms \"so that the threat of nuclear war will no longer hang over the world.\" The two countries, he added, \"must live together in cooperation rather than in confrontation.\"\n\nMr. Nixon has served 2,026 days as the 37th President of the United States. He leaves office with 2 1/2 years of his second term remaining to be carried out by the man he nominated to be Vice President last year.\n\nYesterday morning, the President conferred with his successor. He spent much of the day in his Executive Office Building hideaway working on his speech and attending to last-minute business.\n\nAt 7:30 p.m., Mr. Nixon again left the White House for the short walk to the Executive Office Building. The crowd outside the gates waved U.S. flags and sang \"America\" as he walked slowly up the steps, his head bowed, alone.\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/080974-3.htm",

Nixon announces his intention to become the first president in American history to resign. With impeachment proceedings underway against him for his involvement in the Watergate affair, Nixon was finally bowing to pressure from the public and Congress to leave the White House. \u201cBy taking this action,\u201d he said in a solemn address from the Oval Office, \u201cI hope that I will have hastened the start of the process of healing which is so desperately needed in America.\u201d\n\nJust before noon the next day, Nixon officially ended his term as the 37th president of the United States. Before departing with his family in a helicopter from the White House lawn, he smiled farewell and enigmatically raised his arms in a victory or peace salute. The helicopter door was then closed, and the Nixon family began their journey home to San Clemente, California. Minutes later, Vice President Gerald R. Ford was sworn in as the 38th president of the United States in the East Room of the White House. After taking the oath of office, President Ford spoke to the nation in a television address, declaring, \u201cMy fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.\u201d He later pardoned Nixon for any crimes he may have committed while in office, explaining that he wanted to end the national divisions created by the Watergate scandal.\n\nOn June 17, 1972, five men, including a salaried security coordinator for President Nixon\u2019s reelection committee, were arrested for breaking into and illegally wiretapping the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Washington, D.C., Watergate complex. Soon after, two other former White House aides were implicated in the break-in, but the Nixon administration denied any involvement. Later that year, reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward of The Washington Post discovered a higher-echelon conspiracy surrounding the incident, and a political scandal of unprecedented magnitude erupted.\n\nIn May 1973, the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, headed by Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina, began televised proceedings on the rapidly escalating Watergate affair. One week later, Harvard law professor Archibald Cox was sworn in as special Watergate prosecutor. During the Senate hearings, former White House legal counsel John Dean testified that the Watergate break-in had been approved by former Attorney General John Mitchell with the knowledge of White House advisers John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman, and that President Nixon had been aware of the cover-up. Meanwhile, Watergate prosecutor Cox and his staff began to uncover widespread evidence of political espionage by the Nixon reelection committee, illegal wiretapping of thousands of citizens by the administration, and contributions to the Republican Party in return for political favors.\n\nIn July, the existence of what were to be called the Watergate tapes\u2013official recordings of White House conversations between Nixon and his staff\u2013was revealed during the Senate hearings. Cox subpoenaed these tapes, and after three months of delay President Nixon agreed to send summaries of the recordings. Cox rejected the summaries, and Nixon fired him. His successor as special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, leveled indictments against several high-ranking administration officials, including Mitchell and Dean, who were duly convicted.\n\nPublic confidence in the president rapidly waned, and by the end of July 1974 the House Judiciary Committee had adopted three articles of impeachment against President Nixon: obstruction of justice, abuse of presidential powers, and hindrance of the impeachment process. On July 30, under coercion from the Supreme Court, Nixon finally released the Watergate tapes. On August 5, transcripts of the recordings were released, including a segment in which the president was heard instructing Haldeman to order the FBI to halt the Watergate investigation. Three days later, Nixon announced his resignation.\nby Taboola Promoted Links \nhttps://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nixon-resigns",

    "Dear Mr Melber and MSNBC contributors, Ms Rigeur, Senator Blumenthal and former New York Times editor Mr Raines, Thank you a very interesting video cast on the astonishing progression of President Trump\u2019s legal defense team\u2019s bizarre strategy. You have all pointed out the unprecedented way a standing president\u2019s legal team have become \u2013 game show hosts - for lack of a better term. The name of the game show is \u201cLies & Bigger Lies\u201d. If one steps back, it is obvious Giuliani and S have come up with the idea of out-doing the showman of showmen himself, President Donald Trump. By following Trump\u2019s 'mode d\u2019emploi' and imitating his card tricks, Giuliani and Sekulow have become 'carnival barkers' in their own right and in so doing they have let President Trump\u2019s outrageous behavior become innocent looking, or at least nothing unusual if not bordering on normal behavior in today\u2019s frenzied media circus. In the court of public opinion, in the world of a 15 minute attention span, Trump\u2019s lawyers know that people will only glean a few details from their antics. The underlying strategy on their \u2018game show\u2019 as Ms Rigeur pointed out is to plant the seeds of doubt for Trump's opponents and the Mueller investigation. They have deviously planted mistruths about the President\u2019s opponents in their well-scripted questions and answers to each other. Their goal is to reinforce suspicion in the US legal system and plant doubt in the minds of American voters. They have also decided that they have nothing to lose.",
    "America is reaping today what it sowed. The entertainment industry has been for decades used to brainwash the American people whilst the bosses have been making piles of money all the soapies and the reality tv shows have been dumbing the public, at least a great majority of them and trump understood this a long time ago and he has been preparing his base a long time ago with his apprentice show etc and he is still continuing to day his propaganda with his lawyers on radio and it is effective. Those who think such a behaviour is disgraceful are not I believe the majority",

    "The Trump corruption started long before the investigation,and crimes have accumulated for decades, and along with Cohen and Manafort charges among the many others.  This makes the Trump team incapable of defending what is occurring as we speak.  No matter what legal team you put behind it, on any platform radio, TV, Internet multimedia.  There is truth they are up against, and the crimes are way too plentiful to even dream of hiding it.  The only reason this is taking so long is that there are so many things to investigate, as well as the prospect that much of the time during the investigation, many people in Trumps team keeps tripping over the legal lines in our justice system on a massive scale.  When this comes to head, I suspect there will be many more indictments, including brown nose members of congress.",

I suspect that they are holding back acting on these criminals until they can guarantee convictions on ALL counts.\n\nThe problem is that trump and his band of swindlers are doing a lot of damage to the economy of the USA and its Citizens.\n\nIsn't it about time that the people of the USA elect people who will actually work to better the USA and its citizens regardless of political differences?",
    "Trump and his minions are waging a war against not only the rule of law, the norms of decency and almost everything this country has ever stood for, but on intelligence itself, they are betting on the majority of this  country, and certaily Trump's base to be brain dead, to be absolutely ignorant and easiyly manipulated by their absurd lies. This is beyond bizarre, it is demeaning, sad, a disgrace to have these cowards in charge of the present day narrative of the affairs of the nation. These are extremely dangerous times. If Congress, or some members of it do not raise to the challenges of the times, this nation is doomed, it will become another two-bit dictatorship. Trump will not hesitate to bring the country to another civil war, his die hard base is located mostly in the states that fought to separate during the 1860's, the southern and mostly rural states where even now its people are among the mos retrograde, racist and willfully ignorant of the country, and proud of being so.",

The stench of this \u2018presidency\u2019 will last for decades and have an effect on all aspects of life, as it devided people and exposed to all of humanity just how low we as a collective have set the bar. \nAnyone supporting this man and his goons have not a shred of respect. \nNot for the planet. \nNot for minorities, not for each other and not for themselves. \nMost of all not for life itself.\nBut even this tradegy has a silver lining. Just like a scab has to be removed to let the puss out and the wound exposed to be sterilized, so this man has exposed us all as bigots, sexist, rasists, money grabbing molesters, kidnapper gangsters. \nIf you think you don\u2019t fit into any of those catogaries, \nthen SHOUT IT OUT!!\n\nBring back RESPECT.",

    "The FBI investigation didn't begin because of the dossier; it began because our Australian, Danish, and British allied intelligence communities saw something fishy going on between Russia and the Trump campaign. They alerted the FBI, in which the FBI started to investigate. Fusion GPS was ORIGINALLY paid for by the Washington Beacon, a conservative press for Republicans, which started before the primaries. When it was clear that Trump was going to get the primary, Fusion GPS wanted to continue the research they had already started. Thus, Fusion GPS approached the DNC about it, not the other way around. Christopher Steele discovered some highly suspicious and alarming reports of Trump's ties to Russia and Putin, Putin's plans to infiltrate and launch a major cyber attack on the United States, that he flew to Washington and hand delivered his reports to the FBI. James Comey, then opened up a counter-intelligence unit. By this time, DNC had already been hacked, the DCCC had been hacked. The CIA and NSA was also involved. The DNC tried repeatedly throughout 2015 and 2016 to go public about the Russian interference, but NONE of the news organizations would take them seriously. They approached the New York Times, NBC, ABC, Washington Post, and Fox News. Nobody would air anything. When numerous state electoral systems began getting hacked, Obama tried to get all 50 states to take safety measures, to call Department of Homeland Security if they notice anything suspicious. All the states felt Obama was overstepping his role, that is none of the federal government's business on how the electoral process was run. They didn't understand it was a national security issue because no information was put forth to the public. The only thing the press cared about was Hillary Clinton's emails. Because the states would not take Obama seriously, he tried to take a stand with both democrats and republicans, but Mitch McConnel refused, despite having been briefed by American Intelligence. \n\nWhen the Russians hacked DCCC and leaked that information to Wikileaks, they published democratic congressional members and senators home addresses and phone numbers. As a result, they received such pervasive death threats that they needed armed guards.\n\nSo many things went wrong during 2015 and 2016 during the investigation. The press should have listened to the DNC, as they were showing PROOF. American Intelligence communities should have gone on national TV to explain the seriousness of the situation. If Mitch McConnel refused to budge, Obama should have gone to someone like John McCain to stand with him. Christopher Steele couldn't understand why our intelligence communities wouldn't confirm that they were indeed investigation the Trump campaign to Russia, and he tried to go public about it as well, and he was about to testify before congress as well. However, James Comey refused to allow him to go public. At this point, he gave up, and went back home to Britain. He did everything he possibly could and nobody would listen. Had the press actually aired anything about this National Security Issue, we would have a different president. Like her or hate her, at least Hillary had plenty of experience, and she was considered a hawk when it came to Russia. She would have stood up to Russia, would have never started a world-wide trade war, wouldn't be going on daily Twitter tirades and inciting violence and bigotry.\n\nMuch of what was written on the dossier has been confirmed.",

Not to get a way from the Law talk, but I would like to know what the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia have going.  They are one of the richest nations in the world and yet they are still getting weapons, intelligence and green barrette assist from the U.S.What I don't know is whether this all constitutes war or is it just getting money where ever we can?  The devastation caused by the Saudi's in Yemen may not ever be repaired. The number of refugees left stranded is sickening.

What I really want to know, though, is what prompted this latest stupid tweet. I bet Trump is just mad at Kellyanne Conway and had to take out his frustration in some way.

    "It seems more likely Trump wants to stop flag burning since people are burning flags, either right or wrong, because of the system that elected him. \nNews stations should stop speculating on Trumps political statements based on the notion that he has a firm grasp of politics or any idea what the long term outcomes of the policy decisions loyal Trump supporters might impress upon their party, which will soon hold a majority in all 3 branches of government.\n\nMaybe he's not intelligent enough to know his desire to silence the media and spread racial and religious bias resembles fascist propaganda. Trump's ego seems to make these decisions, only when he recognizes a freedom of speech, which people or news outlets (in the case of his desire for libel law deregulation) use, that feel abrasive to his thin skin for testing/questioning his presidential qualities. \n\nFreedom connects society in a way that building walls to neglect peoples couldn't. Believing a race defines a people is wrong. Culture and experience is what makes a human being. Believing cultural practices and beliefs are inferior to your own, only prolongs one's dehumanization and neglection of other human beings.\nGood luck USA.

I think it's hilarious how average minded people can't appreciate true genius, and instead, hurl demeaning insults.",
    "Trump's goal is to revoke citizenship to all minorities and ensure the Republicans permanent control of all government.

    "Back by popular demand. Long post, but well worth it because it fits Trump to a T.\n\nThe 14 Defining Characteristics of Fascism...If this isn't a wakeup call, nothing is.\n\n1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\u00a0\u00a0 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\u00a0 3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\u00a0 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\u00a0\u00a0 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\u00a0\u00a0 6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\u00a0\u00a0 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\u00a0\u00a0 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\u00a0\u00a0 9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\u00a0\u00a0 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\u00a0\u00a0 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\u00a0\u00a0 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\u00a0\u00a0 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\u00a0\u00a0 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.___Dr. Lawrence Britt\nhttp://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm",

Which would have illegal and smells of money laundering...Then Guiliani comes out and says Dump paid Cohen back for Daniel's...That might mean that Dump was party to the laundering...If Cohen faces hard time for money laundering, Tax Evasion, Bank Fraud, etc. by taking the fall for Dump, or roll over on the man who treated him like crap, no wonder Dump acts like he's worried...",

    "@MJ\n\"Pay to Play\" was called Bribery for centuries. How did it get changed? \nLook at what ColumbusNova's (henceforth \"CN\") attorney said--and didn't say about why M Cohen was paid: \"...regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate....\"\nImportantly, CN's tricky lawyer does not say CN is looking for money for its own real estate business.\nTherefore, if CN is an investment company asking about \"investments in real estate\", it seems more than fair that this president would conclude that CN was offering money to his family real estate business. \nAfter all, he proudly announced that he loved money and didn't like turning it down.\nMoreover, Son-in-Law Jared was then publicly soliciting real estate loans and investments for his real estate business in his first days working in the WH.\nCN's statement also does not say that the money will come only from Americans, and the American who owns CN is the cousin of one of the Billionaire Russian Oligarchs, Viktor Vekselberg. \nOf course, this Billionaire Russian Oligarch is one of the ones who doesn't want his access to America to be curtailed in any way. \nFurthermore, he wants to move his money to the free American market away from Putin's grasp.\nThe fact that the real estate investments were apparently not followed through upon (most likely because of Mr. Mueller's investigation) allows them to deny that Viktor Vekselberg provided any of the money paid to Cohen.\nWhen you read the other companies' statements, \"equivocation\" is the word that quickly springs to mind.\nThey'll find out that tap dancing on the literal truth will eventually turn out to be tap dancing on quicksand. \nMake America Sane Again! \nIndict these crooks, Impeach this president and let us Vote for a new Congress.\nWo0dy",

    "WARNING! WARNING!  You Leftist Democrats grab your life jackets.\n\nThere is going to be a wave in the 2018 mid-term elections.  In face, it will not be a wave, but a tsunami and the color will be RED!\n\nThe same environment is again being created that was created in 2016.  That being bogus polls, fake news,  media bashing, etc etc.  So polls should be showing President Trump up to at least the 80% approval if the truth was known.\n\nThe other thing that was in existence in 2016 was the enthusiasm and the size of crowds that President Trump brought in 2016.  That still exists today.  Enthusiasm was the reason that I predicted that Trump would win the Presidency.  I just could not find a Bookie to place a bet.\n\nEnthusiasm is again the reason that there will be a RED Tsunami in the 2018 mid-term elections.  I predict the House being retained by the Republicans and increasing their majority and the Republicans will have over sixty Senators in the Senate.  Bottom line, the Democrat Party will be irrelevant in Congress after 2018 mid-term elections much like your program and network today.  It will be interesting to hear the reporting on this by the Left-Wing media.  In 2020 more Democrat Senators will be eliminated in that election with President Trump winning again in a landslide.\n\nThe thing to watch for and vote against in Republican primaries are any candidates supported by Karl Rove or Senator McConnell.

I think he meant to look crazy and uninformed, etc. He knew Trump would come out and question if he should be working for him and then Trump will fire him or keep him hidden from the media. I believe it was all calculated and intended to manipulate public perception. I don't think it will work on Mueller, but Trump's sole mission is to put out as much \"crap\" out to the public...the continued attacks on the media trying to ruin their credibility and his supporters are sucking it up like oxygen. Trump does or says something bombastic or seemingly uninformed so the media goes into a frenzy and they don't talk abut the Mueller investigation. I think Obama's part in the Iran Deal had a lot to do with Trump's decision to pull out, but I also think he is going to lead us into a war at the behest of his supporters (as if they understand foreign policy at all) and Netanyahu. It's a little suspicious when the country with the most to lose should Iran get nuclear weapons and they're the only one's pushing Trump to get out of the deal. He wants us to go to war and maybe he'll back us up. That's probably the one thing that has me the most worried out of all the decisions that ego-maniac has made thus far. North Korea may actually be serious this time...Un is young and he took over the country at a really young age...he very well may feel they need to take a different approach. He seems to be stepping outside of the norms for that country so there's a possibility something good may come from the talks between the US and North Korea. Good for Trump should that happen. It's a little like Obama getting Iran to the table after 50 years, but no one gave him any credit for that.",

You don't risk (covert) 'participation) in those types of deals for a few hundred thousand dollars here and there. And splitting the 4 million into multiple 'suitors' only increases your exposure and risk. Plus, the use of the same LLC as was used for Stormy\u2014that's just sloppy, lazy work.

But, I'm expecting some of these 'good guys' to start abandoning ship at some point....unfortunately, there are very few of them in this administration.",
    "Wow....the dominoes are falling one after another.   The many calculated distractions have spared Sessions for the moment, but he should have resigned as well since it is pretty clear he committed perjury about Russia during his confirmation hearing.  And, we just found out about DeVos's brother creating a back channel of communication between Russia and Trump administration.  This Russian thing is growing by the day in spite of Trump's desperate efforts to deflect and distract.  If this thing results in any amount of collusion or corruption, there will be a lot of Republicans in political survival mode....I don't understand why they are so defensive, or even supportive of Trump.  I'd be keeping my distance from Trump if I was a GOP politician, and I'd want to be seen as someone who genuinely wants to get to the bottom of what Trump and others might be hiding.  But all these guys who are conspicuously running interference for Trump will be in a world of hurt if anything bad is discovered...and I'm betting that there is bound to be something nefarious behind it all.",

After Maria, all three islands have been rendered helpless with power lines and phones lines covering the streets. The most viable option will be relocation to the continental United States. Being that the airport has been shut down until further notice, they will have to remain on island until then. Looting has already begun and that usually sparks some violence.

YOUR PRESIDENT IS NOT WANTED IN EUROPE !!  IT IS THE FIRST TIME EVER IN HISTORY THAT WE EUROPEANS REALLY HAVE TO SAY THIS ABOUT A US PRESIDENT !!!  BUT AMERICA, YOU VOTED FOR HIM...YOU ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE !!! SAD SAD SAD !!!!!! OVER 70 YEARS OF GOOD ALLIANCE ...IS GONE IN JUST 8 MONTHS  ! SHAME ON YOU AMERICA AND AMERICANS !!!!",
    "Trump is.embarrassing America ignorance is a bliss. How you tell a contry what they should do. Clean your house first I think you need advise on how to run your presidency ifiot",
    "Ignorance isn't always bliss, specifically the ignorance of the existence of mental disorders that leads to an election of a mentally deranged person for a president.\nWe need to demand that he is removed right now because the longer we wait the more he will, like a tick, embed himself into the body of the political system.\nThe most shocking fact about the Trump's presidency is that no one within his party has any clue about mental illnesses and the danger that such people present to the country or the entire world.\nThis is not a joke! It is an extremely serious situation that needs to be dealt with immediately!!!",
    "Well, trump has managed to make his base and putin very happy. If you go into meetings, especially as critical as NATO and Prime Minister May, you need to be extremely careful that you are more intelligent than these people and you must have all your facts straight. If you rampage in, like trump did, all puffed up and aggressive like a bull in a China shop without meeting these two important criteria, then you come across like a mad, dangerous bull in a China shop. You leave the owner, the rest of the free world, scared and wondering how they, we, are going to pick up the pieces. Aggressive, unintelligent people are the definition of bullies and bullies can easily be controlled by the ones they consider their heroes. In this case, with trump, it is putin and trumps base. It hasn't sunk in yet to a lot of people that we are involved in a different type of war and if we don't stop putin and trump we will potentially lose our democracy.",

TRUMP IS STILL TRYING TO DESTROY NOT ONLY OUR COUNTRY BUT THE G7, NATO, COUNTRIES THROUGH TARIFFS.  REMEMBER HE AND POMPEO MET WITH KIM, REPORTS FROM KIM SAID THE MEETING WAS AWFUL AND HAS SAID THAT SEVERAL TIMES, BUT TRUMP SAID EVERYONE IS GOING WELL. NEXT HE MEETS WITH  PUTIN ALONE. ONE MIGHT ASK, WHY ALONE? PUTIN LOVES TO PLAY WITH WEAK PEOPLE. IF TRUMP IS TRYING TO DESTROY AMERICA, MAYBE IT IS WORLD DOMINATION. PUTIN AND TRUMP(LACKEY). I THINK THEY SHOULD CALL TRUMP HOME NOW. MORE INFORMATION WILL BE COMING OUT TODAY. YESTERDAY, I WAS FEELING OPTIMISTIC.

He appears not to have any social skills or understanding of what it means to be guest in another country. Look up the word diplomacy next time before you speak Mr president, you can learn something about dealing with other people of the world.",
    "Enough...does Trump have to destroy the USA completely before Republicans and his base rescind their support.

Keep licking his arsehole trump, it's all you can do. Vile sad pathetic old man. But then what does it say about the US that they allow him out, and allow him to act like this?",
    "Americans should not really complain if Trump is not  welcome in Britain, after all  he is no longer welcome in most parts of the USA.  ... but there's a little place in Moscow ...",
    "And that's how you get deals done. Haggle for more than you want, and walk away if your expectations aren't met. That's what the Americans voted for, and that's what they're getting, a president that represents the people that voted for him. I bet the majority of people in the UK wish they had a leader like this. One that wouldn't allow that tiny man mayor to restrict police, and is oh so excusing of the increased migrant crime rate.",
    "Trump would have us believe he just used his mind-bending negotiation skills and everyone succumbed to his views over breakfast. Fine with me. Nothing has actually changed but the Great Man pretends that is has and so is happy. Give him a reward, say a gold-coloured cardboard box to play with.",
    "What a vulgar bumpkin is representing America these days. And to think there were enough \"don't know, don't care\" voters to get him elected. Will the sane citizens kindly get out and vote Democrat next time?",
    "Speaking as a Brit, I don't think Trump insulted May at all. He was honest. May has made a complete hash of Brexit, maybe she should have taken Trump's advice. If we don't get a better deal than May is proposing we won't be making deals with anyone. As for NATO, again he is right. Too many NATO members have failed to meet the 2% threshold for decades, not just a few years, but decades. Why should America carry that burden if they can't be bothered to meet their obligations?",

But like with so many mentally deranged circus clowns, getting attention any way he can is paramount. It\u2019s one reason he wears minister\u2019s clothing \u2014 flowing colorful gowns with a Roman collar, like many Catholic priests. And he\u2019s driven around in a 1955 fire-engine red hearse, one configured into a convertible, all the while lounging in the backseat eating grapes like the ancient Roman emperor Nero was fond of doing (on his palace daybed). As to his bat-shyte kooky musings on homosexuality, he\u2019s only fronting (so to say). It\u2019s only a matter of time before he gets married to Michael Jackson\u2019s ghost\u2026 (satire)",

    "If you follow the Christian faith you'd understand why the pastor is so upset by the attempt of a secular takeover of the property.  Further if you followed the civil rights struggle you'd also understand how the L.G.B.T. community in his mind has made a mockery of his struggle.  Both of these circumstances do not avail him of his Christian call to treat all in an aire of love however.  Demeaning others is not giving an aire of love.  Granted, his faith says implicitly that homosexuality is an abomination, further his faith says that homosexuals will not inherit the kingdom of God.  These directives are not any reason to demean anyone I say again.  The Bible doesn't say that we must like everyone on the contrary, everyone is given their own free will yet we are called to love one another.  If I were him I would pay the debt owed the city.  I would fight to keep the building and then in an aire of love I would discus in earnest with the elders the possibility of letting homeless, specifically homeless gays, the occasional use of our facility with Christian stipulations.  God, specifically Jesus the Christ, doesn't hate gays, Christ loves all.  Fact of the matter the God inspired scriptures says that homosexuality is a sin, but in spite of our sin which christ and God hates, he still has a passionate love for us.  The pastor in his bitterness is leaving out this crucial component of his ministry.",

I did not say had to deal with the burden)? \n\nI'm all for women having the top positions and making all kinds of money. Equal pay for the equal quality of work. We also have to look at the social pressures women put on men when it comes to money. \n\nIf men felt that their wives (of course I'm doing a bit of generalizing) TRULY and I mean truly respected them for staying home to take care of the kids knowing that he won't bring home as much money, then I honestly believe that men would feel more comfortable staying home. However, men fear of being disrespected if they don't make as much money. So they prefer to stay out and work.

    "The point about using cyber attacks to create problems for voters at polls is an important one. It doesn't just cause voters to be inconvenienced. It also can trigger the need for the voter to be given a provisional ballot. \n\nHow equally are provisional ballots treated state to state when the vote is on a state or local candidate choice or a state or local issue? Is that same treatment used to count federal choices if the ballots cover both state, local and federal elections? \n\nWhat is used to determine if a provisional ballot is counted as eligible? Who makes that judgment? What notice is the voter given of a hearing or determination meeting? Is the voter required to show up at a hearing? If the voter asks to schedule a time, say before or after work or during lunch, is he or she accommodated? How can the federal government be sure hackers haven't studied provisional ballot counting rules in all the different states in order to design vote changing programs in states that have insecure vote processes?  \n\nI was surprised to learn in my county provisional ballots were tossed if the voter did not appear at a hearing. I had never heard anyone talk about these hearings or seen any information of them in voting materials. In one year in my State there were 31,000  or 32,000 provisional ballots just tossed out. They were not identified as fraudulent votes. But the very fact the ballots were provisional meant they were treated differently. The different treatment needs to be investigated by looking at each state's processes and the reasons used to accept each provisional ballot or reject each provisional ballot. \n\nThis is even more important now, when we have proof hackers entered voter rolls and may have left illicit programs which could be timed to change some minor  information about the voter on the voter rolls. A number change on an address,  a middle initial change, a license number change - anything that might cause a change resulting in the use of a provisional ballot, can,  downstream of the voting day, result in the provisional ballot being tossed. This, then,  represents a vote change if the ballot is denied. \n\nIf states still practice not counting provisional ballots at all if the total number of provisional ballots could not affect the winners or lossers (provisional ballots have ten days after vote day to arrive at the board of elections) then any trace of a practice program by hackers might  go unnoticed. In fact the eventual release of ballot results by counties provides hackers with a free results package!\n\nBallots, absentee ballots and provisional ballots are all different and each one may have different state practices applied to their use. Our borders have been violated by hackers from foreign adversaries. How can we believe our voting processes are secure when the federal government doesn't even understand the various processes that have existed over the years for allowing and counting the various types used?",

    "IS the FAKe NEWS MSM GUILTY of INTERFERENCE in ELECTIONS?\n\nThe media are essential to democracy, and a democratic election is impossible without media. A free and fair election is not only about the freedom to vote and the knowledge of how to cast a vote, but also about a participatory process where voters engage in public debate and have adequate information about parties, policies, candidates and the election process itself in order to make informed choices. Furthermore, media acts as a crucial watchdog to democratic elections, safeguarding the transparency of the process. Indeed, a democratic election with no media freedom, or stifled media freedom, would be a contradiction in terms.\n\nIn 2005 the yearly World Press Freedom Day international conference produced a declaration that stressed \u201cindependent and pluralistic media are essential for ensuring transparency, accountability and participation as fundamental elements of good governance and human-rights based development\u201d. Furthermore, the declaration urges member states to \u201crespect the function of the news media as an essential factor in good governance, vital to increasing both transparency and accountability in decision-making processes and to communicating the principles of good governance to society\u201d.[i]  \n\nWE KNOW which ones ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL, ACCURATE WITH FACTS, and IMPARTIAL....CBS, CNN, MSNBC, NY TIMES, WASHINGTON COMPOST, POLITICO.......etc...  \n\nIn order to fulfil their roles, the media need to maintain a high level of professionalism, accuracy and impartiality in their coverage.  Regulatory frameworks can help ensure high standards. Laws and regulation should guarantee fundamental freedoms essential to democracy, including freedom of information and expression, as well as participation. Meanwhile, provisions such as requiring government media, funded out of public money, to give fair coverage and equitable access to opposition parties, help ensure appropriate media behaviour during elections.\n\nThe media have traditionally been understood to refer to the printed press as well as radio and television broadcasters. In recent years however, the definition has become broader, encompassing new media including online journalism, and social media. Citizen journalism is widely gaining traction, including in countries where traditional media is either controlled or strictly regulated.\n\nA prime concern of media coverage of elections is the right of voters to full and accurate information, and their rights to participate in debates and dialogue on policy matters and with politicians. Inherent to this task is the entitlement of parties and candidates to use the media as a platform for interaction with the public. Furthermore, the Electoral Management Body (EMB) has a need to communicate information to the electorate \u2013 and to a variety of other groups, including the political parties and candidates. The media themselves have a right to report freely and to scrutinize the whole electoral process. This scrutiny is in itself a vital safeguard against interference or corruption in the management or conduct of the electoral process.\n\nThe relationship of the EMBs to the media is hence a multifaceted one, including:\n\nAs communicator: the EMB will invariably want to use the media as a vehicle for communicating its messages to the electorate.\nAs news story: the EMB will be a focus of media interest throughout the election process. The media will be interested in the information that the EMB can provide, as well as trying to scrutinize the EMB\u2019s performance and the efficiency and integrity of the elections.\nAs regulator: the EMB may in some instances be responsible for developing or implementing regulations governing media behaviour during elections (especially relating to direct access to the media by parties and candidates). It may also be responsible for dealing with complaints against the media.\nThis brief example from Senegal in 2012 brings to life the roles of media in elections:\n\nThis election has attested to the proper functioning of the democratic system in Senegal but also confirmed the important role that media can play in regularity, transparency and reliability in the polls. Journalists went to the polls to report live, interviewing observers, members of the polling stations and the public, to check whether everything was going normally. They also reported irregularities, fraud and threats of violence to get authorities to respond. Groups of thugs who were plotting to disrupt the vote during the first round were arrested after the media reported on it. And all day long, you had people and political leaders calling the radio and TV stations to tell them about any cases of wrongdoing, so that journalists could fact-check and report. The greatest role the media played in the election process was after the voting was over. In the evening, radio and television stations and online press provided live results that were posted at polling stations. This helped to prevent fraud and to quickly confirm the need for a second round. [ii]\n\nThe Media and Elections topic area explores the many dimensions and nuances of media within electoral contexts. It is written with a wide audience in mind: EMB commissioners and staff, donors, candidates, governments, students, voters, and members of the media.\n\nThe topic area includes an introduction of media\u2019s Core Roles in the context of elections, as well as discussion of human rights and gender considerations. A brief History of Media and Elections is provided, as well as an in-depth look at the current international Media Landscape, including media ownership.\n\nA chapter entitled Legal Framework for Media and Elections provides substantial discussion of the different models for a regulatory framework for the media in elections, ranging from an independent electoral commission to a specialized media regulator, such as a broadcasting commission or a voluntary media council or press complaints body. It looks at different rules that apply to public and private media.\n\nThe topic area includes a chapter on EMB Media Relations, looking at the ways in which electoral management bodies can develop their own strategies to enable them to get their messages across the different media. It discusses how media mapping, audience research and message development are crucial to this task and explains media relations strategy in relation to the electoral cycle.\n\nThe topic area also explores basic techniques and uses of Media Monitoring during an election campaign, outlining both quantitative and qualitative methodologies and looking at how media monitoring has been used by different bodies such as EMBs or observer missions.\n\nMedia Development explores media professionalism, elections training, and general support and advocacy necessary for the media to become a viable participant in democratic processes.\n\nLastly, thirteen Case Studies are provided to give examples of the way specific countries have experienced and managed media and elections.",

As you said you've reached it, there's got to be a tipping point. If this isn't, what is!? Moore has clearly crossed it by any sane person's standard & he is not qualified to represent the good people of Alabama. We, individually, make America great & strive to keep it great. We choose what is OK for our homes & towns & people. Moore is not OK. I believe the women & accounts of people who worked around Moore. If they waited for decades to speak out, so did other victims in non-political worlds, women as well as men, because it's really hard. Outside of & beyond politics, victims are coming out, regardless of this election...there is a wave that is encouraging people to share their bullied experiences & to think deeply about this issue now. Let us not brush aside the most serious of so many accusations swirling around everywhere. Moore cannot represent America, and he cannot speak for Christianity. I know there is someone else, and many others, in Alabama, who can do that...there is no way Moore is our only choice. He will continue on with his ways if he is elected & manage to not hold himself accountable for anything he does. It will not just be those victims, but he will be disrespectful in the same manner to his constituents, because at the core he puts himself above the law & his ways above people's ways that are preserving & protecting our communities. With so much personal agenda, Moore is frankly a liability for Alabama, practically speaking. He will not even work well with other Republican Senators, and I can't see anything getting done. He will taint the Republican Party, and hurt the Party's chances in national elections. Not everything is political or can be dismissed as fake. It cannot be that anything goes.

Still, Hilary was not a good choice. We had to choose between a rat and a snake.",
    "Not surprised that Comey related Trump to a mob-like figure. In the 1980's it was well known that Trump had association with New York mob affiliates. Throughout his life he has picked up strategies that he liked & uses them in his approach to all things Trump. I suspect his innate narcissism drew him to need power -- which he has adopted from mob-like figures, Russian associates & the mechanisms of dictators & fascists to his way in which he runs the country and in how he functions in business. In so many ways, he is ethically and morally bankrupt.",

    "Trump was born rich, then used it to bully other people into doing what he wants.  He is uneducated, stupid and without morals, but for the last 70 years, nobody could tell him because they wanted money from him.  His entire career and business has been about two things.  Forming a relationship with the NY tabloids and feeding them lies about himself that makes him look good.  For instance the reason Trump Tower did so well is because the tabloids were reporting (based on his leak) that Princess Di was going to live there.  The other thing he does is sues contractors... all the time...  He bankrupted dozens of Atlantic City small businesses just by never paying his bills, then at the last minute sueing them to delay paying even longer.   At best he never pays them, or he settles and pays them pennies on the dollar for work that these small businesses had done for him years ago.

Trump lied about this when interviewed and so did his campaign manager, but now the man in charge of crafting their platform says it was Trump who directly told him to alter it to make Russia happy. And is now under FBI investigation. \n\n2) Russia hacked the DNC and not Trump's campaign.  These attacks were timed to coincide with moments that would do the most harm to the Dems.  A former MI6 agent has proof that favors were exchanged with the Trump campaign to secure these hacks.  \n\n3) Trump's staff continued to have unauthorized communications with Russian officials after the election.\n\n4) Trump has business interests worth billions dependant on Russia.\n\n5) Trump has gotten pay offs from Russia.\n\n6) Since taking office Trump has eased sanctions on Russia and praised Putin and Russia at almost every turn. \n\n7) Now a Trump appointee has committed perjury over ties to Russia.  \n\n8) The CIA considers Trump a risk to National Security and refuses to give him breifings on sensitive information.\n\nIf we want real action on this, we have to keep pushing daily on it, get out and protest every chance you can, call your member of the senate and congress and tell them if they dont take action on this, they wont get another term.  There was far far less evidence against Nixon when he was impeached. \n\nThis is about the safety of America and insuring that we don't wake up one day to see the Russian flag flying over the white house.  This isn't a joke of something to take lightly.  You don't like Dems?  Fine thats your right.  You want abortion banned, you want tax cuts?

In November, when Dems storm the House, possibly even take the Senate (it's numerically possible, though very tight), the GOP no longer has any chance of installing Kavanaugh or any other corrupt pick.  Then the SCOTUS might decide Trump CAN be charged.  Big money withdraws from Republicans and goes Independent, even Democrat.

And then lets get a donor who contributed significant dollars to her Campaign to argue against her? Like he is going to admit, this is pay to play, when he has already paid, but not played. Really, MSNBC you are nothing but a propaganda machine. Hillary hasn't disclosed Sh!t. Destroying documents under subpoena , having her husband speak with the Attorney General days before a verdict (when she is the subject of a felony investigation ), conspiring with the DNC to incite riots,  building a garment factory in Haiti, under the guise of a Nonprofit organization, aka Clinton foundation. and transmitting classified including TOP SECRET documents via a home server? Just to name a few. \nMSNBC, all you have to do is look at the Clinton Foundation financials on their web site, then take look at Haiti. They show millions and millions of dollars going to Haiti, including millions in employee expense??????? All Haiti got out of the deal was two soccer fields and a GARMENT FACTORY run by a foreign company that has a record of sexually abusing women.  GET YOU HEAD OUT OF the SAND.

Why has she been targeted and plagued by 'bad stories' since she chose to keep her maiden name during her husband's first election run? If the reporter doesn't recognise the ingrained bias within herself and our society as a whole, she will never get the answer she wants to that question. Is Clinton persecuted because she is evil or because she is a woman?

Double Standard.\nHillary is being scrutinized over her donors because she showed her Tax returns unlike Trump who has not released his.

Double Standard.\nHillary is being scrutinized over lies.... yet Trump lies ten times more than her. Double Standard.\n\n\nThe FBI director, clearly aware of what his letter would provoke so close towards the elections, has not dealt with it in a proper way nor in any way similar to anything in history.

The Clinton Criminal Enterprise stinks of corruption and deceit.",
    "wow, he makes some very clear and simple answers. trump, his surrogates and supportors keep trying to throw shade and shrouds of doubt and doom, but never with a shred of evidence. on the otherhand, trump leaves nothing but trails of evidence of his sexual assaults, illegal activities, and abusing the legal system to take advantage for his personal gains at the expense of everyone else- not to mention the instigating racism, religious persecution, sexism, and countless dangerous and destructive behaviors.",

    "Mueller is kinda like Elliot Ness. I love seeing justice done! We're off to see convictions, the wonderful conviction of Don! Follow that wabbit! Sadam hid in a hole too! Anybody need popcorn?",
    "This will be long, but it may explain why Republicans on the Hill have been pretty darned quiet about Muellers investigation. This article was in a Dallas newspaper on August 5th 2017: Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, Scottt Walker, Lindsey Graham, John Kaisch and John McCain got a total of 7.35 million dollars, collectively from a Ukrainian-born Oligarch who is a business partner of two of Vladimir Putin's favorite Oligarchs and a Russian bank. Leonid, 'Len,' Blavatnik is a billionaire who donated 6.35 million to GOP presidential candidates and senators during the 2016 presidential election. Mitch McConnell received the biggest contribution; 2.5 million dollars. The money came from two of Blavatnik's companies, Al Altep Holdings and Access. Blavatnik holds dual citizenship in the USA and Russia. Blavatnik's connection to Putin comes in the form of Oleg Deripaska who is close to Putin~He founded Rusal the worlds largest aluminium company in Russia. Oleg married into the Yeltsin family in 2010.  In 2006 Deripaska began making annual payments of 10 million dollars through the Bank of Cyprus to trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort to advance President Putin's agenda. (There are some great articles about the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, that was in the meeting with Donnie and Jared and the rest of them on June 9th, 2016 at trump towers. It was about the Magnitsky Act, short version; President Obama signed it into law in 2012. Magnisky discovered a corruption scheme, he was thrown in prison, they said he died of a heart attack, but the Russian Human Rights panel said he'd been beaten to death, he was only in his forties or early fifties.  Lawyer Preet Bharara, the lawyer trump said was staying on then fired him,  alleged that  a company called Prevezon Holdings, it involved the Bank of Cyprus, was money laundering, Magnitsy accused government officials of conspiring to steal 230 million dollars in fraudulent tax rebates. Obama had 14 million dollars frozen and put sanctions on 44 rich Russians, in turn Putin blacklisted people in the USA and barred US citizens from adopting Russia orphans. This is why donnie and Jared and the rest of them said they were talking about Russian children and adoption. It was true, partially, Putin is furious about the Magnitsky Act, he wants it gone, he called the Act an outrageous act!! So the truth was that Ms Veselnitskaya has been desperate to have those sanctions gone and the frozen assets back! \n\nDimitry Rybolovlev is also connected to Deripaska and Putin. Rybolovlev owns 3.3% in the Bank of Cyprus, he is the one who bought trump's 60 thousand square foot mansion in Palm Beach for 91 million dollars, trump had paid 41 million dollars for it, the guy had it torn down! Deripaska was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2009 he was rescued the state owned bank, Vnesheconom Bank, Putin is chair of the advisory board. The president of VEbank is none other than Sergey Gorkov~the man who was meeting with donnie and Jared. Gorkov was also one of the two Russians in the oval office when trump went in to tell them that he had just fired his nutcase FBI Directer so it took the Russian thing off him. If you got through all of this, I had to live to 75 to find the man who has caused devastation and heart ache everywhere he went, throughout most of his meaningless life, there has never been a person trump couldn't use, as president, when he fits the description of cult leader, better!. With this investigation of him, with more talk than I've heard about Russia since the fall of it, with it always coming back to trump or his people, it is like the Russians have tentacles woven around Washington and elsewhere. I, of course have the time to conduct my own Sharon investigation, it is absolutely intriguing how the people around trump fit together like puzzle pieces. For instance, first of all anybody who doesn't know what Steve Bannon, who is Robert Mercer a multi billionaire and his daughter, Rebekah who does most of the speaking for her reclusive dad's missions were, Google the CPAC Convention, where, in his speech Bannan maps it out, pay particular attention when Bannon says, \"Take the cabinet appointees, each one of them was hand picked~\"  Those people are doing what they were hired to do, it didn't matter if they knew anything about the job. Bannon did what he wanted to, he dismantled our government, and the people on the HILL watched him, they are guilty of treason!! Google; Eric Prince/Seychelles, another guy trying to find a back channel for Putin and trump to talk, and the reason Betsy DeVos is the ignorant Education Secretary!! I think most of trump's supporters voted for him, because he is a racist just like them and most of them knew nothing about trump except for his stupid UNreality show!!",

The Feds have way more evidence than Trump or even the media realise. They know everything that went down.

    "It is former Greek nobility that dominate over the global shipping industry and they work closely with British Peers and London merchants. The Greek's monopoly on shipping is known as the Greek Merchant Marine. Some top Greek marine merchant families include the Onassis, Livanos, Latsis, Mavroleon, Constantakopoulos, Kulukundis, Vagliano and Niarchos families. Eddie Kulukundis is a Greek-British merchant marine owner of Rethymnis and Kulukundis Ltd.  Spiros Latsis is a London educated Greek billionaire banker whose father Yiannis Latsis ran a massive merchant, shipping, and banking company called Latsis Group which still operates out of Greece, London, and Switzerland. The family also created the Latsis Foundation. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation is a charity front used for making criminal payoffs disguised as donations and grants like most major charity organizations. Spyros Niarchos and Philip Niarchos are the heads of this family today. Georgios Vernicos is a London educated Greek politician and businessmen running a large Yachting company.\n\nThe brothers Vardis Vardinogiannis and Yiorgos Vardinogiannis are wealthy Greek businessmen involved in the oil, shipping, and energy industries. John Angelicoussis runs a large shipping company and is worth over 2 billion. Georgios Ekonomou is a billionaire and CEO of DryShips Inc. located in Greece. The Angelicoussis are a Greek shipping family that later established themselves in London. Leon Patitsas is the British-Greek owner of Atlas Maritime an oil shipping company. Many Greek merchant families are really ancestors of Arab-Turkish invaders that have blended into the Greek culture after the Byzantine nobility migrated to Venice. The Greek Merchant Marine companies are covertly involved in the Black Market and use the Greek Mafias to carry out criminal activities involved with shipping like illegal arms, drugs, and human trafficking. They enable the mafias to do the dirty work. In the United States the Velentzas crime family and Greek Philly Mob work with La Cosa Nostra. Velentzas may refer to the Latin word Velum which means a sail. The Velentzas crime family manage La Cosa Nostra's criminal operations at the ports.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization is headquartered in London today with Efthymios Mitropoulos as a recent Greek born Director of the IMO. The International Maritime Law Institute is located on the Island of Malta a commonwealth of the United Kingdom and is an agency of the United Nations for the purpose of training marine merchants in maritime law. Maritime Law is the law of the seas and has been governed by monarchs that authorize and fund marine merchants and explorers. On the island of Malta is Fort Satin Angelo a former Knights of Malta base that included a military port and today Fort Saint Angelo is sovereign from the Government of Malta today. The Knights of Malta oversee Maritime Law. The reason that the Venetian nobility dominated over shipping and trade for centuries was because they were Greek-Byzantine merchants that moved their operations to Venice and Genoa. \n\nThe Giustiniani family are one of the top Venetian-Genoese banking and merchant families and also involved with the Vatican and Black Nobility. The Giustiniani family are a continuation of the Justinian Dynasty that ruled the Byzantine Empire. The Italian word Giusto means Good or Just. The Pallavicini family are also a top Venetian-Genoese banking and merchant nobility. During the Crusades in Greece the Pallavicini family ruled as the Marquisate of Bodonitsa located in Greece near Athens. The Italian Pallavicini family married in with the Cromwell family creating the variant Paravicini. More recently Camilla Paravicini married Greek merchant mariner Manuel Basil Mavroleon. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is headquartered at Montego Bay in Jamaica. It was Oliver Cromwell that conquered Jamaica from the Spanish for the English Crown. Horatio Pallavicino was a Venetian banker who financed the English Crown's shipping and naval enterprises and several of his children married Oliver Cromwell's children. Greece is Pallavicini and Giustiniani territory. Baron Girolama de Massa is the head of the modern House of Giustiniani today and he is secretly a Massimo.",

Unprofessional though it may be on a real news show, you have to hand it to her for bringing down a house she didn't even know she had. I can't help but feel closer to her and feel her pain. Or laughing gas... I believe she was about to wet her pants. A new comedienne is born.",

    "I never thought I would like a clip from Morning Joe, but this one changed my mind.  It was the right decision for them to laugh at furry degenerates.  When we look back and see how great society was in the past (most elements of it, at least) and compare it to now, furfags stand out as a key element in the degeneration of society.",
    "I am a furry.. \nAnd to see these people moch us, is honestly disrespectful. \nWould they do this to any other person? No, so what makes us any different? So what some of us wear suits? I dont get it.. \n\nIm not personally into the fur-suit bit.. But still.. This is disrespectful to us furries.",
    "This is disgusting, people could have died and just beacuse they are wearing big animal costumes makes it ok!? I can't believe some people would be so disrespectful, and there were children in that con too, it's not just for adults. Smh this \"news\" station is crazy for thinking it's ok to laugh at this.",

    "For some reason i am far more intrigued by Willie Geist simply moving on with his reading of the story from the teleprompter. Somehow the reaction Mika and Joe were showing seems so much more human and normal to hearing  this / realizibng what it entails than just smiling through it and doing your job professionally... so Willie has experience with stories involving Furries? :D",
    "I understand the reporters... worries(?) about this but she shouldn't go to the extreme of leaving the building. As well as they had a gas leak, which is serious for anyone, including furries. Its a hobby and should be known as such. Just my opinon",

    "No matter what you think of furries... the real story here is that people at a convention were targeted by a chlorine gas attack... Mika and Joe's reactions were highly unprofessional. BTW -- furries seem pretty harmless to me, so hey, do whatever floats your boat. I'm all about freedom of expression, as long as you are not hurting anyone.",

If there's anyone who knows about the history about the fandom he's a good one to ask.\n\nAnd I love how MSNBC can't be bothered to give this the same professionalism that they give their other stories. After all, furries, doing anything good and being the victim, at the same time by keeping people warm in the cold air? Nope, can't happen on their watch, it doesn't fit the rhetoric.\n\nThis is why most furry conventions keep the press on a tight leash if they allow them at all.",

You never laughed when someone fell? It's not like that. Can u imagine not knowing what \"furry\" convention is??i don't think she meant to be rude!!! I pray for people hurt!! She was probably laughing at the costumes",
    "SHAME ON MIKA AND THE TEAM FOR LAUGHING.  19 PEOPLE HOSPITALIZED.  WHY IS IT OKAY THAT THIS INNOCENT GROUP OF PEOPLE WERE ATTACKED?    Do you know children participate in the Furry fandom.  Very disappointing.  Making light of this attack is unconscionable.    What other groups do you think it is okay to physically harm?    If this were a church group would her reaction be okay?  A group of surgeons--okay?  Appalling.  Not okay!",

Because most people are the type to laugh at us and are the same that would laugh off a poison gas attack, just like these reporters. Lets do the earth a favor and either get our act together or go extinct already",
    "(This is obvious, but I'll go ahead and state it) She ran away because it's a serious story (You know, the possibility of an attempted  mass homicide) and she doesn't want to be seen laughing because that could be (would be considering how inept people are at processing news) considered her laughing at the incident (instead of her simply thinking the furry thing is funny).",
    "Wooow.... I heard about this news report, but LAUGHING as they read that people were hospitalized? We have a weird hobby, whoops. That doesn't entitle you to laugh at our predicaments",
    "I understand why they found this funny but this was inappropriate. The actual segment was about people being hospitalized. This really wasn't cool. If you found it funny and had to leave then I get that and that's great but to continue with the banter when the segment was clearly quite serious was not right. Nobody can control uncontrollable laughter but by continuing their banter they were just being insensitive!",
    "The mocking and condescension in the \"reporting\" about this was pretty unprofessional. I'm not a furry nor do I have any interest in the hobby. I find nothing wrong with this. I find nothing wrong with enormous amounts of people attending comic conventions dressed up. There are WAY worse things people could be doing with their free time than this.",
    "I like how the furries in the comments jump on the Liberal hating train just because thier fandom is the laughing stock of national news. I don't like liberals either but using the term when you're so butthurt about someone not taking your fandom seriously is very amusing to me.",

    "I love poking fun at furries as much as the next person, but I have to admit that seeing them all concerned for the welfare of a baby was nice. I mean, other than the fact that I hope there wasn't some store, or something, open not too far away where she could have kept the baby warm without the need for 15 sweaty weirdos huddle / cuddling.",
    "Let's be fair here, no one is laughing about anyone being gassed.  I remember the first time someone told me about this fetish.  I screamed with laughter.  They have every right to do what ever turns them on if they are all consenting adults but I think we also have the right to laugh about it.  Laugh, not bully, not demean, not lock them up in asylum's.  When did we all get so uptight we can't even laugh about other peoples weirdness.",
    "I swear, if u guys told her that furries are people who dress up in animal suits and f*** das wrong\nbut if u told them they are people who dress up and role play then lmao",
    "I can get them laughing that's fine get a quick chuckle out, but when your laughing at the people and forget that 19 of them are in the hospital now, that's what I call offensive.",
    "Cant believe people want to troll her reaction. She was not trying to downplay the seriousness on the report (a gas leak and people being hospitalized). She had a dirty thought moment caught on camera. Which is understandable, if your HUMAN. Those who are not, possibly Republicans, should just get off social media and get a life that includes some form of therapy. Lighten up. Have some fun. Stop being so serious. Was it not Trump who said we should do away with political correctness? This was a fun moment (her reaction) and I'm glad I caught this.",
    "Just going around learning about this event. So far news channels just can't stay serious. Comments so far have been an unfriendly gathering of trolls, haters, and hot tempered Furries (I'm not hot tempered, but I am disappointed by the reports so far that I've seen, and these comments. But hey, we're Furries, people see us as degenerates, that's how it is.) going at each other every comment or two that has replies.",

    "This is a real thing ... they hold conventions all over the country, not just young adults either... there are 60 year old's that dress up and some come from Europe to attend these , basically it is a contest to see who has the best costume and they party... obviously these so called journalists need to stick to bashing trump because they don't have a clue to what happens in real life...",
    "Are people seriously demanding professionalism from a story about \"Furries\"? I'm sorry but sane people will laugh at wacky stuff, and dressing up as a stuffed animal for whatever reason IS as wacky as it gets whether you like it or not. Sorry Furries, but you are wack.",

    "Just disregard the fact that people could have been killed in the attack.\nI'm not trying to be edgy or salty or whatever, but it should be pointed out that this is incredibly unprofessional. Although, you gotta give props for the man in dark brown suit (I apologize, as I do not know his name) for actually trying to tell the story.",
    "This wasn't a reaction of disgust, it was a reaction of embarrassment. It's obvious that Mika/Joe have a thing with furry costumes. It doesn't take a psychologist to pick out a classic case of reaction formation.",
    "People say unprofessional when the director's there don't do nothing about it when they laugh, and them saying they are laughing at the ones who got hurt when they aren't , they just want an excuse for them laughing at furries lol",

THEY'RE FURRIES!!! OH HOHHOHOHOHOHO!!!",

Because laughter is infectious AND because as a lady of later years myself, I KNOW Mika was RUNNING to the BATHROOM!!! \u00a0lolololo \u00a0 Happens to me all the time, Girlfriend. Wear a big pad for laughter accidents, just in case!",
    "To all the butt hurt furries stop whining about this there not laughing about the injures it just caught them off guard give them a break. I'm a furry and I found 2 30-40 year olds finding out what a furry was for the first time pretty funny it wasn't professional but it was funny. Stop being so uptight your not helping our status by whining.",
    "I just wish Mika would have stayed and continued the story so we could have gotten more of her reaction. She was so confused she couldn't even read the prompter LOL. You could tell she was thinking \"I have got to be reading this wrong.\"",

Does he also interrupt a news broadcast about Syria or something with \"What is Syria? Is it a place and where is it then? I just gotta know right now!\".Their job is just to read off a teleprompter and retain their composure. Kudos to the third guy though, that actually tried to do his job by delivering the news he was hired to do, despite getting constantly interrupted by his male co-worker at his side, yelling to the crazy female running in the studio. If they can't even be professional and read off a teleprompter, they are truly inept and should be promptly fired.",

They are weak and unable to deal with reality so they construct an alternate one in which their fantasies are normal and innocent. Hail Satan.",
    "That woman being kept warm by a bunch of people sounds like the person that said to her friend \"I guess I'll go, but im not wearing a costume, I still think this is all a bit weird\". \n\nShe didn't look at all happy to be on camera stuck inside a furry sandwich.",
    "Alright, I'm a furry. Can everyone chill? Some people seem to think that they were laughing at the incident and no, they were laughing cause we're hella weird. Giant dog costumes? Not average. Just stop tearing each other to pieces in the comments.",
    "All these people calling furries 'unnatural', 'disgusting' and so on and so forth make me cringe. Is it out of the ordinary? Yes. Does it affect you at all? No. People who judge others based on their hobbies are far worse than even the weirdest, most depraved furry.",
    "What they didn't tell you was that Mika, shortly after being informed what a furry convention was, exclaimed: \"AWESOME!\" And booked it towards the nearest computer to make reservations for the next convention. Hopefully, one with a little less chlorine.",
    "I love how the news had no idea what happened at that convention. I'll tell you what happened.\nA 4chan user was at the convention, and spilled some grape juice on his fursuit.

Do you know of any cleaning solution that'll get that out? Pls help fast before it sets\nAnon: chlorine and ammonia should get it right out\nFurry: Thanks friend, off to fix my fur suit so I can get back to the con tomorrow!\nHe took the advice of an anon, and that's all that happened. This naive little furry had no idea what kind of destruction he would cause.",
    "This was hilarious to watch! With all due respect to furries, you have to let people find something funny even in the direst of situations. Otherwise this life would be miserable. I've been the laughing stock in serious situations enough to know it brings us closer and bonds is better than anything else!",

    "I still don't know wtf a furry is, but I am pretty sure I can figure it out. Any mature person would just have to laugh. Sometimes when something strikes our funny bone it just builds on it's self and get's funnier than it really is. Personally I pretty much  find that the majority of fetishist are beyond creepy and should be kept as private as possible. Also Morning Joe has it's flaws and sometimes it is flat out ridiculous I still tune in. I love Joe.  YT thinks it's oh so special and different. Get a grip.",

    "This was hilarious! I doubt Mika was so offended by something sexual, she probably couldn't stop laughing. And who wouldn't? I saw the \"Furry\" story at the hotel break on the news and I cracked up seeing the people in the various costumes. At least Mika didn't go online to see\u00a0 what furries were before she was told.",
    "Oh you poor dear. And she's a \"Woman of the world\"! Highly educated, well travelled. Can you IMAGINE the kind of meltdown some \"gawd-feering\" home schooled Iowa yokel would have if this were discovered...? Don't shelter people from reality. It WILL find them eventually.",
    "If you do a Furry story and go there live; remember the standard furry greeting is a hug.  Furries are people who dress in Anthromorphic costumes to be different.  College mascots on steroids. :P",

This women's reaction was extremely uncalled for and unnecessary. So what if they are furries, admittedly it's not a normal thing for news to report on but this was a serious attack and therefore should be taken seriously.",

    "I'm a full on conservative and I found this completely unprofessional guys i mean you can have your opinions but to laugh at a fandom on live tv after hearing 19 hospitalized because of an intentional gas incident probably a hate crime just shows others watching it's ok to laugh at those kind of people in fandoms your all news anchors do your research interview some of them give them some respect atleast instead of assuming stuff very unprofessional guys very unprofessional",
    "WowI mean I'm kinda of a furryBut really commentsI was kinda like \"don't laugh the mad furries will come and get you\"But at the same time REALLY??Not mad about her laughingBut how she just ran away XDAny-hozles, for all the mad furries. Nothing fo be mad aboutFurries are like pizzaWe all love/learn how to liven em' And we can all add our on toppings \u2661x",

    "Wow... I might not go to furry conventions or even be a furry but this... This is just rude. Actual people could have been killed in this possibly intentional gas attack and these douches just can't get over the fact that they wear animal costumes. Thanks for being a five year old.",
    "I don't get this at all. If they weren't furries, they wouldn't be laughing. It's a gas incident which sent innocent people to hospitals and you, a news reporter, laughs about it?",
    "OK, opinions about a fandom aside, it's her duty to report the news.  The public disdain displayed is an embarrassment to her professional character, especially when reporting about an incident involving chlorine poisoning that could have seriously harmed or killed people.",
    "Okay, it's hilarious that they didn't know what furries are. And it's even funnier that the one girl just ran off, laughing!\nBut it's pretty amazing that there was a girl by the hotel with a baby, and people were giving her blankets and jackets to keep the baby warm, and some people in fursuits actually made a kind of \"cuddle party\" to keep everyone warm. :3",

Mark my words. You heard it here first",

I hold love for all life, but when you go to the weird extent that these people do, it only makes me wonder how they can wake up in the morning.\n\nDo anime-loving folk go down similar routes? Yes, and I don't see them as fanatics; I see them as crazed and obsessed lunatics who always try to challenge the status quo with something \"new\" or random that doesn't bring in anything significant other than the premise of their boredom.\n\nYou can like things, and you can enjoy sharing that interest with others, but at least have the decency to do it in a respectable and civilized manner.

    "The important thing to note about Republican voters who say they think the Mueller-led investigation is \"unfair\" is that they have no clue wtf they're talking about, have no concept of what's actually happening, don't understand criminal investigations, aren't following the investigation, and can't comprehend the justice system or the process the special counsel's office is adhering to. Yes,  the official mandate was to investigate potential collusion and any and all related potential crimes. However, like all law enforcement, Mueller is required by law to investigate any potential crime he may come across during his investigation. This is why the scope continues to broaden; not because Mueller is just doing whatever he wants, but because during the course of his investigation, he has come across a multitude of potential crimes. The idea that he is choosing where to go is mistaken. This is part of his oath. He would be in the wrong if he didn't investigate. Now the only thing he's doing is investigating, and it's critical that people understand what that means. Think of it this way; a cop receives reliable information and some evidence that indicates a person is selling drugs out of his car. The cop therefore has a mandate to investigate the person.  The cop must focus his investigation on the car. If the cop investigates the person and discovers that his brother is also apparently selling drugs, the cop must now investigate the brother. If the cop searches the car and finds evidence to support the allegation that there are or were drugs in the car, the cop must then search the person's house to ensure they recover all evidence of drug dealing. If the brother  is caught with drugs, then his home would be searched. If at the home, the brother's girlfriend is prostituting herself out of the house, the cop must now investigate her. That is exactly what Mueller is doing. Neither is being unfair. Just like the cop, Mueller is simply investigating. The person, their brother and the girlfriend still have to be charged with crimes that evidence has indicated they committed, then they would be put on trial and have full access to the legal process. The same is true with Mueller's investigation of Trump. He's simply collecting evidence. If the person in the example had no drugs in their car or home, the cop would conclude the investigation and no  charges would be laid. The same would be true for Trump if no evidence of criminal activity is found. That is still a possibility, we don't know what the special counsel has in terms of evidence, so there is no legitimate reason to accuse Mueller of being unfair. If Trump is innocent, then no evidence will be found. If the police thought you had a dead body in the trunk of your car because they had potential evidence to support that, would you want them to thoroughly search your trunk to prove you were innocent? Of course. So why not allow Mueller to investigate - and potentially clear - Trump? It appears to me as if anyone who is accusing Mueller of wrongdoing or complaining that this investigation is unfair simply doesn't understand what's happening. The other key fact in this case is the importance of the investigation into potential Russian crimes in the US. That needs to be investigated and the truth needs to be established. The probe has already indicted multiple Russian entities and persons, and that must be allowed to run its course to completion. I just feel like if more people understood these things, it would potentially quiet some of the unjustified attacks on Mueller.",

And this calming message doesn't address what concerns me: that Russia *did* interfere in our last election via targeted Facebook ads and hacking the Democrats' emails to release info that would cause well timed scandals. At that time, there was evidence that the hackers had also hit Republican emails but had not released anything. My fear was that the Russians (or more accurately Putin) would hold whatever they had found there for \"compromat\", blackmail of elected officials. And now, we have President Trump again saying he believes Putin's claims that they didn't interfere, and we have no evidence the executive or legislative branches are preparing a defense of the fall election. (If you believed Rex Tillerson, none was possible!) Most alarming, the day before this aired, on July 3, a group of the most prominent Republicans traveled to Russia to meet with the Russian Parliament. Purportedly it was to tell them not to meddle, but the footage doesn't show them even mentioning it. Instead it appears to be \"we are very excited for the Trump-Putin summit, we hope it will be 'very big', and there is no reason for us to be adversaries\"......this is what alarms me.

You look at the symptoms, the policies, the rhetoric, the coup launched against the justice system (FBI, CIA, military), the dissent into factionalism, right-wing militias, the charismatic, violent-prone leader, the corporatist policies, the culture of right-wing grievance , the embrace from right-wing Christian groups, the takeover of institutions via purity test, etc, etc., etc.. \n\nPut the Don's policies, rhetoric and actions to date under a microscope and you have a very good picture of a neo-fascist government. And thank your lucky stars that the people that comprise the institutions will take a stand... and be prepared to kiss the Don's ring if they fall.",

We must be clear on the fact, we have the right and the responsibility to vote! Never give up the right to vote and never downplay your responsibility as an American citizen to value your rights! All men are created equal! Neither the pauper nor the priest has the right to diminish our rights. Do not believe we have a king in office.  He is no more entitled to the rights of this Democracy than the least of them, my brethren. Hold tight to the importance of the Constitution, It describes our rights.. Even if you do not have the physical ability to go out and canvass the neighborhood, get on the computer and write letters to members of congress and declare your intentions in this  election.  The left would not cry fascism were it not appropriate. Please read and become knowledgeable on the meaning of fascism.

    "I can understand the \"this too shall pass\" attitude. However, this has slowly become one of the most dangerous times in our country's history since Nixon. Alan Alda made the point that Trump won the election because of all of those who chose to stay home and not be bothered to vote. I'm one year older than Trump. I remember the Republican Party when it was a conservative party serving the American people recovering from the depression and WW2. Since Nixon's resignation in 1974, while the public has been inattentive, the Republicans have been gaining power through illegitimate means such as gerrymandering. They were setting things up to seize power themselves, but found that a foreign power had swept in and seized it for themselves. What to do? These men are no longer young and mentally agile. So now you are left with the Baby Boomers, who were being drafted to fight in a war that no one understood, and today's young people, who are saying \"I'm not a paper target-Stop shooting at me\".  The goal has to be to say: \"Wake Up America! Your personal passion for your country and for being the \"good guy\" in local, national and international disputes has to make you ashamed of our recent actions without honor.Americans have a strong set of core values. We \"hire\" our elected officials to work together in a bipartisan manner to advance American goals and objectives. All other goals/objectives are secondary.

We don't aspire to being shut off from the rest of the world. We don't aspire to stealing children away from their parents, we don't aspire to turning away people because of their religion, race or societal status. The USA hasn't lost its soul it never had one to begin with. We know that the vast majority of Americans don't aspire to those things either, but what we don't understand is how Americans blindly accept they can't change the current situation they find themselves in.

No, of course Trump isn\u2019t how Mussolini or others like him ended up, but he certainly seems more inspired by Putin & Duterte\u2019s form of leadership, than by Reagan or Eisenhower\u2019s. His administration is also incredibly, unashamedly corrupt. Those on the left, along with many on the right & in the center are trying to make sure Trump\u2019s worst impulses don\u2019t harm generations of Americans. Saying none of Trump\u2019s policies have hurt anyone yet, sounds extremely privileged, to me.

    "When people classify as hypocritical the claim that all men are created equal, they forget that the \"Founding Fathers\" and Thomas Jefferson, in particular, were under the influence of European thinkers, one French, in particular, Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Br\u00e8de et de Montesquieu, yes, the one who wrote \"The Spirit of Laws\" and about \"checks and balances.\" Actually, Thomas Jefferson translated to English a book about this [Antoine Louis Claude, Comte Destutt de Tracy, A Commentary and Review of Montesquieu\u2019s \u2019Spirit of Laws\u2019]\n\nWhat were Montesquieu's views on slavery? Well, he condemned it, but keep reading:\n\n(The Spirit of Laws, Book XV)\n\"Slavery, properly so called, is the establishment of a right which gives to one man such a power over another as renders him absolute master of his life and fortune. The state of slavery is in its own nature bad. It is neither useful to the master nor to the slave; not to the slave, because he can do nothing through a motive of virtue; nor to the master, because by having an unlimited authority over his slaves he insensibly accustoms himself to the want of all moral virtues, and thence becomes fierce, hasty, severe, choleric, voluptuous, and cruel.\nIn despotic countries, where they are already in a state of political servitude, civil slavery is more tolerable than in other governments. Every one ought to be satisfied in those countries with necessaries and life. Hence the condition of a slave is hardly more burdensome than that of a subject. \nBut in a monarchical government, where it is of the utmost importance that human nature should not be debased or dispirited, there ought to be no slavery. In democracies, where they are all upon equality; and in aristocracies, where the laws ought to use their utmost endeavours to procure as great an equality as the nature of the government will permit, slavery is contrary to the spirit of the constitution: it only contributes to give a power and luxury to the citizens which they ought not to have.\n...[however]...\nWere I to vindicate our right to make slaves of the negroes, these should be my arguments:\nThe Europeans, having extirpated the Americans, were obliged to make slaves of the Africans, for clearing such vast tracts of land.\nSugar would be too dear if the plants which produce it were cultivated by any other than slaves.\nThese creatures are all over black, and with such a flat nose that they can scarcely be pitied.\nIt is hardly to be believed that God, who is a wise Being, should place a soul, especially a good soul, in such a black ugly body.\nIt is so natural to look upon colour as the criterion of human nature, that the Asiatics, among whom eunuchs are employed, always deprive the blacks of their resemblance to us by a more opprobrious distinction.\nThe colour of the skin may be determined by that of the hair, which, among the Egyptians, the best philosophers in the world, was of such importance that they put to death all the red-haired men who fell into their hands.\nThe negroes prefer a glass necklace to that gold which polite nations so highly value. Can there be a greater proof of their wanting common sense?\nIt is impossible for us to suppose these creatures to be men, because, allowing them to be men, a suspicion would follow that we ourselves are not Christians.\nWeak minds exaggerate too much the wrong done to the Africans. For were the case as they state it, would the European powers, who make so many needless conventions among themselves, have failed to enter into a general one, in behalf of humanity and compassion? \"\n\nSo, the problem is not why \"The Founding Fathers\" maintained the institution of slavery but why, now, when we presume to know better, we do nothing about it. There are \"Americans\" making money of \"de facto\" slavery which is perhaps worse than \"de jure\" slavery.\n\nhttp://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/tracy-a-commentary-and-review-of-montesquieus-spirit-of-laws",

    "Aha,  so  Trump  sold  Ukraine  javelines,   as opposed to Obama's denial to sell Ukraine offensive weapons,  for the reason of  protecting  Manafort,  which is actually protecting  the  Trump  campaign  from  charges of collusion/ conspiracy.   The  unsettling conclusion, however, arises when we consider,  those javelines would be used against Putin's  forces,  Russian regulars or  specially selected Russian loyalist, trained, and supplied  troops, many or all right from slots in the regular Russian army, to be deployed as bogus \"Ukrainian nationalists\" opposed to the alleged fascist western and central Ukranians who deny the \"legitimate\" demands of the easterners who allegedly want to be part of Russia.  Trump's American supporters will argue that Trump cannot be buddies with Putin since he approved sale of the Javelines, contrary to Obamas  decision to sell only defensive weapons to Ukraine, in order to prohibit them from  turning the situation in east Ukraine and Russian border into an excuse for Putin to invade eastern Ukraine outright,  with no pretense, i.e., filling  eastern Ukraine with Russian troops.  So we need to keep in mind that Obama's opposition and refusal to supply Ukraine with javelines  was based on depriving Putin of an excuse for overt invasion of eastern Ukraine.   However, what Obama did partl instead was to order up ahead of its scheduled deployment,  Americans into new NATO slots, right up next to Russia's border in several of the new NATO nations, as well as forward positioning all kinds of military hardware at the disposal of these new NATO nationns troops as wel of course any other NATO forces who might be deployed there.

    "Two reactions: first, to the poll. \u00a0To say that someone is most admired with 17% or 9% is like looking at the number of viewers watching this or that show on one of the broadcast networks these days. \u00a0\"Oh, look at that! \u00a0Show X had 845,000 viewers and show Y had only 810,000,\" when there are well over 250 million potential viewers in the country, and neither is getting impressive numbers. \u00a0Limiting the choices or asking the respondents to rank their top 10 and then assigning points to each rank might have been more convincing. \u00a0Discovering that Clinton is most admired by 9% means that she is not most admired by 91%. \u00a0Still, that he came in second to Barack Obama is going to irk Pres. Trump no end. \u00a0Secondly, however, Pres. Obama demonstrated his clear-headedness and leadership qualities way back in September, 2008, when the economy of the world was on the verge of collapse, and then-Pres. Bush and his advisers were trying frantically to prevent it that mid-September weekend and in the coming weeks with the first installment of the TARP program. \u00a0John McCain, stalwart war hero though he was, \u00a0started running around like Henny-Penny suggesting the emergency was so great, the two candidates ought to suspend their campaigns. \u00a0Barack Obama surely knew how serious the problem was but didn't want to exacerbate it, and instead exuded calmness and confidence that the US would get through this challenge as it had survived every challenge before. \u00a0And he was right. \u00a0This contrast surely played a significant role (along with the Palin debacle) in the size of his win. \u00a0How Donald Trump convinced 63 million Americans that coolly and confidently was not the way to govern and hysterically was, I don't understand, even given all the frustrations so many felt about the gridlock in Washington. \u00a0The gridlock continues, as the president's deal-making skills are shown to be much weaker than advertised. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Because the president seeks adulation, not solutions to problems. \u00a0He will never be adored by liberals, so, as he desperately wants to be adored, he plays only to those who already adore him. \u00a0For this reason he refuses to act \"presidential,\" because that would not get him rousing applause at rallies of the people he depends on for emotional support. \u00a0He either does not recognize this character flaw or does and is controlled by it and is \u00a0thus unable to combat it.",

We owe it to ourselves and to future generations not to accept less than the best available in this country. I believe that the \"blue wave\" was a sign that people are finding their way back. Bush's death has yanked our chain enough to make us think twice about what we have allowed to happen.

Such as Robert Mercer. And shady people such as Roger Stone. The Meuller investigation is a threat to many of these conservative congressmen.

Giuliani wouldn't be on TV saying he doesn't respect women who pose nude as much as he respects a \"career woman\"... almost a shame, he might get what he deserves.

    "The extent to which the American political system has been compromised by Russian hacking. American right wing media has also been influenced, and a general large scale social media disinformation campaign has been ongoing and is having a definite effect. The NRA has ties to Russian influence peddlers, and many American corporations have been hacked into. Ordinary Americans have had their personal information exposed, especially through hacks like Yahoo, which resulted in 500 million accounts being completely hacked for several years with no public acknowledgement until much later. Similar things have been happening in Europe. What we basically have here is a very large sustained attack on American and European social, political, and economic systems by a large, corrupt state. And it's been successful. The American president is fully compromised (which is a scenario beyond even most cold war espionage fiction novels). A significant portion of the American population think there's no problem. Inward hostility in America is increasing, and there's real risks to large and very dangerous external conflicts as Trump seeks for ways to solidify his base. The inward hostility is the most worrying as Americans turn on themselves while Russia gets deeper and deeper into our affairs. Trump and certain right wing groups are leveraging this turmoil and are now ideologically aligned with Russia against their own country.",

    "Beautiful journalistic work. But.\nThere's always a risk with this kind of conjecture. Namely that it's easy to stack confirming details next to each other while ignoring inconvenient ones that disconfirm. And please note that I'm not saying this is all up-in-the-air nonsense at all. You just haven't included any such disconfirming details. Do they exist? The viewer doesn't know. It's very convincing, but there's *no* scrutiny possible against it. So it should always be taken with a grain of salt. This is why courts don't condemn purely on the beauty of your argumentation but instead ask for corroboration of evidence. It's conjecture, not proof.",
    "Is this the smoking gun? Doubt it. Most Trump supporters see nothing wrong with Russia stealing documents from a US political party to try to influence our democracy, and think colluding with Russian spies is no big deal.

I think they might actually be sheep that refuse to see the con man who's pulled the wool over their eyes because they'd rather watch America burn than admit they voted for a con man.",

At the same time, there was also an aggrieved minority of Republicans who felt that this kind of \"white collar\" crime was no big deal and wished Nixon and Republicans hadn't played as fairly as they did. They've spent a lot of years talking about the \"good\" Nixon and making people think \"Watergate, so what?\" Republicans these days think rich, white Republican men should be able to commit perjury, bribery, and obstruct justice. It's just one of the perks of wealth in their classist vision of society. The \"law and order\" party only cares about the harshest possible punishment for crimes committed by poor and working-class people.

    "Trump can yammer about \u201cno collusion\u201d forever, but he has obstructed justice publicly for all of us to see repeatedly.  On this crime, he\u2019s cooked.  Obstruction of justice is a serious crime and if you add to it the fact that what was being investigated was the possible tampering with an American election by a hostile foreign power, and obstructing that investigation...well, doesn\u2019t this resemble treason?",
    "We are the height of the \u201cInformation Age,\u201d and information is a marketable commodity. Information has proved itself to be suitable for sale therefore it is marketable. Being readily salable, information then has become a commodity, an economic good or service that has full or substantial fungibility: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. Our information market has become a capitalistic dream where the purveyors of information have little regard as to veracity of the information. Information and disinformation are on equal footing as long as there is a sustainable market offering a good margin of profit. The marketing of information has paved the way for hucksterism. The term huckster describes a person who sells something or serves biased interests, using pushy or showy tactics. Historically, the term \"huckster\" was applied to any type of vendor or reseller, but over time it has assumed distinctive pejorative connotations and dismayingly, our President, is the \u201chuckster-in-chief.\u201d",

Even if we clean the stain how can we, as Americans, EVER trust government again!

Just imagine the amount of dirt Mueller has collected\u00a0 that we know nothing about! I only hope that when we come out on the other side of this that\u00a0the real America will persevere.",
    "Obviously Pompay did discusss it with Trump or he would say no. Not recall only means yes, otherwise say no. The choices are really limited. If they aren't a liar by nature and they did in court or anywhere they swear to tell the truth. Say yes, no, 5th, don't remember or don't recall, or remain silent. So if you did do whatever and you are not a liar your answers are limited. If you didn't do whatever your answers are limited. You can not not recall something that never happened. You can only not recall something you are familiar with. Just a penny.",

    "Trump utterly and completely believes that ANYTHING that he wants done MUST be done, no matter the cost to the careers and reputations of others. He , of course, will always get off without any tarnish, because HE is DONALD TRUMP!!! Being Donald Trump means that he is above the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, he is above the reach of the law of the land. He cannot be held by ANY oath, he is loyal to his own well being. The oath he took when he became president means NOTHING, he is the lord and master of the American government. HIS whims and needs take first place. He is the God Emperor of ALL three branches of government, there can be NO checks and balances. He will NOT be checked. Or balanced.\nAmerica, the very structure of your Republic is under attack from within. Ask yourself; do you want to be just a part of the Russian empire, or a sovereign nation? Because the GOP and their emperor mean to hand your country over to Putin. It's being done, now, inch by inch.\nAmerica, you have to decide; do you want to reclaim your Republic and rebuild it, or just give up and become Russian citizens.",
    "Nixon escalated an unconstitutional and unethical war in an attempt to divide and distract the American people to hide his crimes. We can already see the writing on the wall for the despicable inhuman lengths our current Commander in Chief is willing to go. Already the horrific atrocities that are taking place against innocent refugees, innocent children, and among toward our most vulnerable underrepresented population. Already the horrific 'deals' with authoritarian regimes, and dismantling of our ties to our closest allies.\n\nHow has our majority-held Congress fallen so low to not be mobilized immediately for removal of this clear and present danger in power? We are under attack from all sides within. DAILY we must endure a never-ending stream of disinformation, misdirection, and outright lies to indoctrinate his supporters, and confuse and mislead the American public. When all of the truth is exposed, will there be enough Congress ethical enough to defend our democracy from this clear and present danger? Will the voices of the American majority be heeded, or will there be - as Senator Mike Lee chillingly threatened at a party fundraiser - civil war?",

It's only the guilty who worry, who have curiosity, who want to know. \"Has he found out about 'xyz' yet?\" You don't ask that question if there is no 'xyz' to find out about. Trump's desire to learn about what Mueller doing is evidence of Trump's knowledge of his own guilt.",
    "What is also interesting on another level is that Mueller fought in Vietnam where so many died because Nixon was hiding and running and diverting. Appalling. Maybe on some level this is him making up for the lives lost during that corrupt presidency. His indirect chance to make things right for them.",

YES\n\nSo after 3 months Manafort finally gives in and spills some of the beans.\nDuring this process of finding data Mueller knows there is to much information  Manafort has about his past giving on different time lines of his work.  This other information would hold up congress for a long time and on other types of investigations not having to deal with Donald Trump.

Now before you Right Wing Nut jobs go off on a tangent and cry and scream and yell.\nIt does not matter if Fusion GPS are owned by the Russia Government and  infact the Russian Government proved Trump Colluded with Russia.\n\nAnd stop talking about stupid Uranium One.\n\nThat was a few years ago and the F.B.I agents  who investigated and who knowingly kept those records to released them later after when Comie and Mueller demanded they give  all documents and investigations back, should be arrest as well for breaking orders.\n\nI dont care and know one does if Uranium was sold to Russia and its rites to American Land\n.  It has nothing to do with Trump!!  Get TRUMP NOW before we all die!!\n\nand MANAFORT scum bag was working with Russia  in that time period as well!!\nWhy dont we use that as evidence?\n\nI know the Pedesta group and others as well with the Foundation made profits by Uranium one.\nSo before the Right wing nut jobs start up again, it is simple.\njust give them  all Immunity \nYou did for Pedesta Group already so do for the rest\nand go after Trump!\n\n\nGet Trump!!

This must be a preamble to the American people exercising their obligation of participation in the American Democratic process. This includes the necessity of holding public figures accountable to ordinary standards of ethical behavior, including telling the truth - without exaggeration or prevarication. It is actually quite simple!",
    "For a man who claims to have such intelligence on all matters and to have probably the best memory we have ever seen, to repeat exactly the same crimes as Nixon. The US is NOT a subsidiary of the Trump organisations and not to do with as Trump wishes. As the pressure and heat continues to rise Trump is going to lose his mind, he is unable to accept advice that contradicts his own deluded world. The corruption in Trumps administration exceeds by far anything that the US has ever experienced before. It would be hoped that all the lawyers in Trumps administration face their legal bars at the end of this and are disqualified from ever practising law again. Trumps very actions in regards to the Russia investigation show just how much he is terrified about what might come out and you only do that if you have something to hide. Trump is committing treason and it is to be hoped that he is held to account for those actions if only to deter any future potential Presidential candidate from standing. As for Manafort  it would be hoped that Mueller with all speed pass over all he has on him to the relevant State authorities so that he can be spend the rest of his life behind bars and because he is serving State time he is unable to receive a pardon. Let Mueller and the relevant State authorities send a message to all these criminals that there is no get out of jail free card. That you will serve serious time if you continue to attempt to block this investigation and your families will lose all you have accumulated for those crimes.",

Your pet understands nothing about syntax or grammar, because as much as you may wish or believe otherwise, it cannot comprehend, nor can it understand you; and believing or expecting otherwise reflects more about your lack of intellect than anything it may express regarding your dog. Expecting any rational behavior, thoughts, ideas, or words to emanate from our current leader (in case you hadn't yet noticed) falls into this same, sad category, and therefore, to be completely honest and frank, let me assure you: He is, just like your pet, quite literally and intellectually, utterly incapable of it!   - j q t -",

Its how putin used trump as his mole, its how trump used the russian hackers against Hillary and its how he is using Manafort now. No a man who illegally works with criminals to undermine the rule of law would never work with criminals to betray his own country. These acts proof trumps character and only dooms him.

    "I think the president is far more worst than Nixon in terms of criminal behaviour.  First and foremost,  he is practically lying Day In and Day Out of his presidency as if there is no tomorrow.  In fact one wonders what else does he not have to lie about ? Then of all people,  he was involved in tax evasion,  money laundering as well as now profiteering from his own presidency position which is clearly a election cheating case by itself.  There is his treason to sell out American interests to Russia as if he is a spy working for the Russian Pudding's employment.  Otherwise how else to explain why is he acting so cowardly in Pudding's presence and treating his own intelligence agencies as enemies.   As if that is not enough,  he has already planted enough spies in the Supreme Court as well as the DOJ and as if the GOP is beholden and blackmailed by him.  And not counting the fact that he is acting as an accessory to Khashoggi murder by stubbornly defending the Crown Prince in spite of the clear evidence.  In short the US President is a crooked criminal who has no qualms to put anyone under the bus in order to save his own skin.  And to think he needs to lie practically about everything and anything,  does he even feel shameful to begin with !!!",

    "Thank you so much, Rachel. We really do need to see comprehensive summaries like this, since it is so easy to forget so many of the things which have led us to where we are now. All those facts seem to get scrambled in the whirlwind of this administration -- new leaves burying older leaves. I'm so glad you took the time to tie things up into a cohesive narrative once again.\n\nWhen I saw the headline about someone saying that Manafort's lawyer was feeding information to Trump, I had my usual reaction. I immediately ask, \"Well, how do we know that, and how reliable is the source?\" I laughed (once again) when our old friend Rudy Giuliani came to the rescue! Okay, so much for needing corroboration... Giuliani's on it! I do hope Trump keeps him on to the bloody end.\n\nHere's one more thought. Much of what we know about Nixon was revealed by the investigations. So far, pretty much _all_ we know about Trump's culpability is what we get from the press or from Trump himself. Imagine how much higher your mountain will be when Mueller's investigation is finished! And after January 3, imagine the huge amount of new information we will get when House Democrats actually do legitimate investigations. How many totally new criminal acts will be revealed? I actually expect some Congressmen to looking down the barrel of an indictment or impeachment. Nunes? McConnell? Maybe some cabinet members? Maybe even one SC justice!",

Now the only question is , did Mueller wanted to find out what this \"something\" is to get a whole picture of this situation? \n\n\nThe answer to this question must be \"yes\", if Mueller is the prosecutor everybody says he is. Maybe and I am speculating here, but Mueller might indict Trump on many different layers like money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States,  witness tempering, obstruction of justice and perjury, to paint a whole picture of Trump\u00b4s crimes and what motivated them.

When Nixon resigned, the people who knew he was corrupt didn't cheer, they weren't happy that a sitting President was shown to be a criminal, they were relieved. The people who supported Nixon and believed his campaign lies were forced to accept that they were naive. The tragedy of the Nixon Presidency was just not the national embarrassment but the 20,000+ unnecessary deaths of American service people and many more Vietnamese.

    "A fundamental feature of democratic systems, based even loosely on the Westminster system (of which the US is an interesting offshoot), is the separation of powers of government. The primary reason for this separation is to prevent the concentration of power without appropriate checks and balances. And it is a feature of most free democracies today. \n\nTrump has practically admitted to unduly influencing an ongoing investigation. What is congresses role in this? At best, they are doing nothing to stop this behaviour. At worst, they are actively helping him. \n\nTo me, it now appears that the US Legislature is colluding with the Executive, to co-erce and subvert a proper and legal activity within the Judiciary ie. they are condoning their number one representative of the U.S.s' constitution and laws, to break those same laws. This is a major problem, not just for the US, but for any country that believes in the sanctity of the Separation Of Powers. It was previously one of the main areas that the U.S. could claim the high ground on. I'm not so sure this is the case anymore. Many countries are probably now watching this saga with considerable worry (Not Russia, though. They would most certainly be amused). A sitting President appears to be trying to block an investigation of potentially illegal activities, which are within the judiciarys' authority to carry out independantly. This action undermines the bedrock under which democracy itself resides.\n\nThese events will cause great concern amongst the U.S.s' main allies, and a serious disadvantage in relations with her competitors/enemies. Trump has always said  he likes Russia, and gets along with Putin. But is he trying to  become too much like him? Can we ever trust a government that circumvents legal process when it is convenient to do so? Is the executive too embarrassed to allow independant investigations the judiciary sees as necessary in accordance with the Governments' own laws? Can we rely on the U.S. to be the necessary counterpoint to countries like Russia, and China?\n\nWe have a moral obligation to do the right thing (or at least be seen to be doing it, from our point of view). Before we do that, we must be clear on what is right. I think that a U.S. President that defends his countries own laws, and commits to personally uphold them, is perhaps a necessary starting point.",

    "Top Iranian adviser threatens to expose those who took bribes to make the Iran deal happen\n  By Thomas Lifson\nAn hour after President Trump announced that he would end the Iran deal, and just before Western European leaders spoke out in defense of the deal, a Middle East analyst for the Jerusalem Post tweeted about a threat from an adviser one of Iran's senior officials, minister of foreign affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif:\nH.J.Ansari Zarif\u2019s senior advisor: \u201cIf Europeans stop trading with Iran and don\u2019t put pressure on US then we will reveal which western politicians and how much money they had received during nuclear negotiations to make #IranDeal happen.\u201d\nThat would be interesting.#JCPOA\n\u2014 Raman Ghavami (@Raman_Ghavami) May 8, 2018\nVivek Saxena of Bizpac Review comments:\nThe adviser's tweet appears to suggest that some Western officials partook in \"pay-to-play\" schemes by accepting money to support and ultimately sign the deal.  The accusation makes perfect sense given that there was no legitimate reason whatsoever to support the horrible one-sided deal pieced together in 2015 by then-President Barack Hussein Obama.\nAs noted by Fox News panelist Charles Krauthammer at the time, \"The most astonishing thing [about the deal] is that in return, they [Iran] are not closing a single nuclear facility.  Their entire nuclear infrastructure is intact.\"\n\"They are going to have the entire infrastructure in place either for a breakout after the agreement expires or when they have enough sanctions relief and they want to cheat and to breakout on their own,\" he added.\nThe world got absolutely nothing in return for signing the deal, yet numerous officials across the Western world signed it anyway.

If we think they are pursuing a weapon all sneaky like our chances of preventing it are no better outside of the agreement than inside the agreement.

Because the rest of the participants in this deal have showed no sign of willingness to abandon it, so good luck trying to hurt them with any sanctions.\nEvery minute that this \"man\" is President costs the US face and he doesn't even realize how literally every statesman and leader is laughing at him behind his back.",
    "He couldn't be more right about the deal being rotten! That said, calling the Islamic govt a dictatorship overlooks the fact that the previous dictatorship it replaced was put in power by a coup d'etat orchestrated from inside the US embassy by the CIA and British intelligence. Iran was a democracy until Shah Reza Pahlevi was put there as a puppet king serving US and British interests. His regime was the most repressive and murderous and 100% backed by the US. Regarding peace it was the US that 'asked' their then ally Saddam Hussein to invade Iran to try to end the Islamic dictatorship that dethroned the puppet US/Shah Reza one. It failed! All that's happening is a result of the US's reckless and misguided foreign policy. The US caused this problem by overthrowing the democratically elected Iranian govt in the 50s. \"The 1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d'\u00e9tat (Persian: \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u062a\u0627\u06cc \u06f2\u06f8 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f\u200e), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name \"Operation Boot\") and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project[5] or \"Operation Ajax\").\" I love America, but its foreign policy is in the hands of fools so I grieve for the world!",

    "Let us review some facts.\n\n1. Iran has a declared War with America that has not been ended by any treaty or cease fire.\n2. Iran has violated terms of the agreement repeatedly.\n3. Iran is using Russia and Syria for a Proxy War with Israel.\n4. While vocal about US reprisals Russia has withheld action for attacks on Iranian targets in Syria.\n5. China is becoming very bellicose in the South China seas and expanding their territorial claims.\n6. N Korea came to a realization WHEN war with China begins with America they will be caught in the middle as a Human Shield.\n7. China has also been assaulting American aircraft in the region with Lasers.\n8. China has ignored Sanctions against Iran.\n9. China and Iran are allies.\n10. Islam is part of the reason why all the hostility in the Middle East is present in the first place.\n11. Not only has Bank of England been playing both sides of the Iranian Nuclear agreement they have also been caught red handed laundering money for Iran. They openly violated Sanctions against Iran.\n12. War with China is imminent. If China takes the first shot Russia will not back them. Chances are if we begin to attack China they may back out of their agreement to help defend them.\n13. Iran has openly defied the US and the UN over and over again.\n14. Iran has made it clear they are out to wipe Israel off the map again.\n15. The MSM cannot tell the truth to save their own lives.\n16. The EU bankers are ITCHING for a war to begin to help depopulate and help their economy have room to \"Grow\" again.\n17. Communist China has been playing the USA for idiots like the Iranians have.\n18. America made both monsters possible and the EU helped a LOT. it was their economic and \"Globalist\" policies that allowed this mess to happen.\n19. Diplomacy is not the solution to all the world's problems.\n20. The impending war Iran wants and both Iran and China will get will go completely out of their control and America once again awakened to the specter of war will wind up doing to them what we did to Europe TWICE!\n21. The Russians are smart enough to not trust communist China for anything. heck, they are smart to not trust us implicitly.\n22. The prime motivating factor to all of this is Human Overpopulation!\n23. China's economy can just as well collapse tomorrow under the burdens they are putting themselves under. A war could break their economy worse than the war itself.\n24. The U.N. has done NOTHING to curb the rising tide of war AGAIN.\n25. There is WAY more to this picture than meets the eye. Trump is in a spotlight that should be cast on other players as well instead of making him the star of the world's evils. There is no such thing as a one person Tango!\n\nSo there, 25 facts to ponder and all TL:DR responses will be viewed as weak minded individuals with the attention span of a goldfish.",

This was a deal based on blackmail and it was very weak and complete garbage.  Sanction Iran until they give up their nukes as NK will eventually do.

    "Puppet Trump is just doing what he is told (by the real masters).\nTheir propaganda machine is working at full capacity to set the stage for another huge attack done by America for the zionists benefit, just like they did in Iraq (and in Syria and numerous other times). The scenario is very very similar to what it was at that time, just replace \u2018Weapon of Mass Destruction\u2019 with 'nuclear plans' and you have the exact same propaganda that they employed previously. Even the faces are the same ones - Bolton was Bush's right hand guy pushing for the attack on Iraq, and now the zionist lobby installed him again to whisper in Trump's ear and he made it absolutely clear that he wants US to attack Iran. And Netanyahu is also there, fabricating lies (just like he did before congress in 2002 when he swore that Iraq has Weapons of Mass Destruction and that it did 9/11 and that we should attack them). \n\nThe zionist bankers have already put everything in place for the attack, the US government is lined up with their guys - Trump, Bolton, Pompeo (to name but a few), and they have complete control over congress and the US media (97% of all media in America is owned by just six mega-corporations. Zionists own all six), to make sure that any dissenting (\"unpatriotic\") voice is silenced. They will pull the trigger very soon, unless something very unexpected happens, like a mass awakening to the way they manipulate us all and a revolt against those heartless greedy control-freaks.   \n\nIf there is no strong public support for the attack on Iran then they might create another false flag terror attack (like they did numerous times before, perhaps something akin to 9/11) to get the public riled up and onboard with their plans, and to justify their attack on Iran. But frankly they don't really need to create another false flag event, they have the whole of America in their pocket, they don\u2019t even need to pretend anymore like they are responding to a made up threat, they can just go ahead and attack and no one will stop them, in fact, the controlled media will cheer them on.",

    "From the very beginning it has been obvious that Trump wants a war in the worst possible way. ideally, for him, such a war would be spectacular but limited, a huge success but little cost, historic (for him) with no downside. He's been dreaming - or should I say hallucinating - about this since he asked during the campaign why we can't use our nukes as long as we have them. A war, from Trump's perspective, provides an enormous serving of red meat to his base, and provides a (very flimsy) legal foundation for war powers. That means near dictatorial authority over immigration, \"seditious\" speech, \"criminal\" whistle blowers, and so-called witch hunt conspiracies designed, he says, to undermine his administration. \n\nTrump, of course, has no clue what he's really doing. He has no clue the repercussions of his breech of contract with Iran. Sure, Iran is a bad actor but the nuclear deal, brokered with much skill and effort by Obama's administration, halted the nuclear program and gave us access to Iran's nuclear facilities that we have just tossed in the garbage. Those advantages will be difficult, if not impossible, to re-create. \n\nTrump's reality show fantasies are going to wreck the relative stability of the post-WWII world, create an ever-larger vacuum for China, an ever-larger playing field for Russia, and weaken both the US and American allies across the world. it makes me sick to see the criminal way in which this has been carried out, from unlawful Israeli intelligence interference to Trump channeling his insane Fox and Friends feedback loop. \n\nThis is now a world stage populated by more and more lunatics at the expense of 99-percent of Earth's population. Unfortunately, by the time Trump's base catches on, it will be far too late to repair the damage.",

Lastly, I predicted at least one new unnecessary war to enrich our arms industries, who need continuous new wars to make $$ and keep their stock prices going up so the bigwigs can cash out.

    "OBAMA FLASHBACK: Deportation Separated Thousands Of U.S.-Born Children From Parents In 2013\nPOLITICS 06/25/2014 09:22 pm ET Updated Jun 26, 2014 https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/parents-deportation_n_5531552.html\nBy Elise Foley\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Immigration and Customs Enforcement last year carried out more than 72,000 deportations of parents who said they had U.S.-born children, according to reports to Congress obtained Wednesday by The Huffington Post.\n\nThe reports were sent by ICE in April to the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, as required by law. ICE confirmed the authenticity of the two reports, which lay out 72,410 removals of immigrants who said they had one or more U.S.-born children in 2013.\n\nThe reports show that even parents of U.S. citizens are among the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants being expelled from the United States each year. They hold particular significance as President Barack Obama faces pressure to change his deportation policies to keep families together. Obama\u2019s deportation policies are under increased scrutiny by those in both political parties as the House stalls on immigration reform and the government scrambles to deal with an influx of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S. border illegally. While opponents of immigration reform have argued that Obama\u2019s lax enforcement is attracting new unauthorized immigrants, reform advocates are turning to the White House to slow deportations.\n\nChildren born in the U.S. are given automatic citizenship, regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status, and a 2013 report by Human Impact Partners estimated that 4.5 million U.S. citizen children have at least one parent who is undocumented. When a parent is deported, their U.S.-born children sometimes leave with them. But some stay in the U.S. with another parent or family member. Some children end up in U.S. foster care.\n\nAdvocates for halting some deportations have pointed to cases involving parents of children who are U.S. citizens, saying parents should not be separated from their children except in extreme circumstances.\n\nWhile most of the parents of U.S.-born children deported last year had been convicted of a crime, about 10,700 had no criminal convictions, although they may have fit other ICE priorities for removal, according to the reports.\n\nICE said 71,214 parents of U.S.-born children who were deported fit its priorities. The priorities include convicted criminals, people caught attempting to enter the country illegally, people who had returned after a previous deportation, and people who failed to report to ICE after a deportation order, according to the report. Because some people may have been deported more than once, the figures reflect total removals, not the exact number of individuals who were deported. The numbers do not include deportations of parents who fail to tell agents they have U.S.-born children or parents whose foreign-born children are undocumented.\n\nThe reports provide no detail about crimes that had been committed by parents who were deported. Critics of ICE priorities say the numbers can be misleading, because they lump together low-level charges and immigration offenses with violent crimes. Reform advocates argue that repeat immigration violations should not make immigrants a high priority for removal, in part because those who reenter the U.S. after being deported are sometimes simply trying to reunite with families.\n\nThere were 39,410 removals of parents who said they had U.S.-born children in the first half of 2013, according to one report. Sixty-two percent of those who were deported came from the interior of the U.S., while 38 percent were apprehended near the border. In both categories, strong majorities of those deported had been convicted of a crime, according to the report. ICE reported that 98 percent of its removals of parents of U.S.-born children in the first half of 2013 were considered priorities for deportation.\n\nIn the second half of the year, there were 33,000 removals of parents who claimed U.S.-born children. A majority \u2014 63 percent \u2014 came from the U.S. interior, and 98 percent of the total fit ICE priorities, according to the report.\n\nColorlines reported in December 2012 that more than 200,000 removals of parents of U.S.-born children had occurred from July 1, 2010, to Sept. 31, 2012, based on a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nAn ICE spokesman told The Huffington Post on Wednesday that the agency \u201cis sensitive to the fact that encountering those who violate our immigration laws may impact families.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe work with individuals in removal proceedings to ensure they have ample opportunity to make important decisions regarding the care and custody of their children,\u201d the ICE spokesman said in a statement. \u201cFor parents who are ordered removed, it is their decision whether or not to relocate their children with them. If parents choose to take their children with them, ICE assists in every way possible including helping to obtain travel documents for the minors or, when possible, allow for the family\u2019s voluntary departure.\u201d\n\nBelow is a video of then-10-year-old Stephanie Pucheta, whose father was deported after being arrested on a DUI charge. She discusses how her life changed after her father was deported:",
    "So of the young children that weren't reunited with their families some of them are US citizens because ICE can't tell the the difference between US citizens and illegal migrants... So there are children under 5 that have been separated from their parents with US citizenships and the US government refuses to reunite them.",

You are talking about about the Gates Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, George Soros, the universities throughout this country with foundations, and on and on and on. Perhaps enough for Trump to pay off the national debt. How much are you going to have to pay???",

    "Why, oh why? Why is it that the Republicans and their real political antecedents have always been lured to undermine the Unity and Democracy of the USA? We can go way back to the Civil War era when the idols of the GOP, even up to now, were bent on severing from the Union, but then as members of the Democratic Party.\n\n It is so ironic and interesting to note that with the successful championing of the tenets of the Union and, eventually, the victory in the Civil War, most of the offspring of the Union breakers infiltrated the victorious Lincoln's Republican Party and took it over.  Most of the offspring of the savers of the Union who were in the Lincoln's Republican Party then changed places to affiliate with the Democratic Party which was seen to be pursuing the original patriotic and moralistic goals of the likes of Lincoln that earned the USA the envious leadership in global Human Rights and Civil Liberties. \n\nThe GOP can therefore only claim the Republican Party as Lincoln's by name but not by deeds.  But, to them, that is all they need to bamboozle the masses to believe they share those Lincolnian ideals to win their votes.  I hope folks would always keenly focus on, and be guided by, the merits of the issues on the Table, and not just by the name of the Party, or what these con-artistes of Conservatives would spend zillions of dollars to advertise to mislead them. \n\nLike their political ancestors, these GOP folks find it more difficult to concede Power to the other side, and would do the most outrageous things to either hang unto Power or grab it.  It is in their political DNA.  If it isn't by voter intimidation, it is gerrymandering. If it isn't gerrymandering, it is enabling burglary of the opponents' information repository.  From Nixon's to Trump's era, the fingerprints of the Power thieves are all over the place.  It has become more alarming with the most likely 'hiring' of burglars from outside, like the Russian cyber-thieves to break into the Democratic computer systems, to enable the GOP candidate win the Elections.  There seems to be some significant graduation from physical break-in, as was in Nixon's time, to remote intrusion and cyber theft with the Russian criminals.",

    "Republican record - 120 indictments, 89 convictions, and 34 prison sentences.  \"When comparing criminal indictments of those serving in the executive branch of presidential administrations, it is so lopsided as to be ridiculous. Yet all I ever hear about is how supposedly \u201ccorrupt\u201d the Democrats are. So why don\u2019t we break it down by president and the numbers? ... In the last 53 years, Democrats have been in the Oval Office for 25 of those years, while Republicans held it for 28. In their 25 yrs in office Democrats had a total of three executive branch officials indicted with one conviction and one prison sentence. That\u2019s one whole executive branch official convicted of a crime in two and a half decades of Democratic leadership.  In the 28 yrs that Republicans have held office over the last 53 yrs they have had a total of (a drum roll would be more than appropriate),  120 criminal indictments of executive branch officials. 89 criminal convictions and 34 prison sentences handed down. That\u2019s more prison sentences than years in office since 1968 for Republicans. If you want to count articles of impeachment as indictments (they aren\u2019t really but we can count them as an action), both sides get one more. However, Clinton wasn\u2019t found guilty while Nixon resigned and was pardoned by Ford (and a pardon carries with it a legal admission of guilt on the part of the pardoned).

    "An informant came to Michael Cohen with information on an individual.  \nThe informant came to Michael Cohen.  He wanted to meet in person to get\n paid for this information.  Michael Cohen had nothing to tell Mr. Trump\n or the police prior to the meeting.  Why would the informant go to Mr. \nTrump instead of Mrs. Clinton?   Mr. Trump was not guaranteed to win the\n election.  The alleged information regarding Mrs Clinton had to involve\n activity before the 2016 campaign started.  There were many candidates \nrunning for president in 2015.  The alleged information was not worth \nanything until Mrs. Clinton became the democratic nominee.  What I am \ntrying to say is that the collusion charges against Mr. Trump are \nunfounded.  Mr. Cohen is guilty of lying.  His problems started with \nthis unknown informant who waited until Mrs. Clinton became the \ndemocratic nominee and then waited until the votes were being counted to\n sell this alleged  information about Mrs. Clinton to Mr. Cohen.  The \ninformant waited for years before selling this information about Mrs. \nClinton?  The informant had to make sure that Mr. Trump would be the \nrepublican nominee and had to ensure that Mrs. Clinton would be the \ndemocratic nominee or the information is useless.  There is no collusion",

It is totally fake news that the middle class does not get anything from the new bill. It is the rich that are not going to benefit from this tax bill according to Trump, but the small businesses and corporations will greatly benefit so our country will grow its economy.

Taxes should be a targeted policy which should have a direct developmental goal. There are times a country should raise taxes may be a couple of years to achieve some tangible things like infrastructure. Once that is achieved the country can then cut taxes for the following 2 years to cool off.

    "Aside from Mr.Rattner's informative contributions on the substance of this tax proposal, this segment has enough irony to make my head spin. A former Republican Congressman talking, correctly, about how lousy Trump is - while Trump was elected by a Republican Party openly gorging  themselves on the putrid red meat he dispenses daily to appeal to the worst parts of so-called Conservatives - while the Republican Party self destructs - while the Democrats are so weak they can't even take advantage of it - while Mika speaks of the misogyny of Trump while sitting next to Joe who seems to have no clue how misogynistic his constant talking over her is - while the Russians try to manipulate everybody. Aaaarrrggghhh!!!!!",
    "Don't forget that the 5.8 trillion tax cut for the wealthy results it the same amount missing from the treasury which means serious cuts in programs that serve the poor and middle class.

    "I understand that it\u2019s part of their dynamic and all that, but I really don\u2019t think Mika gets the respect that she deserves (on air, might be different in real life though). Joe interrupts her 24/7 and then calls her out for talking before him once? I don\u2019t get it.",

    "Why doesn't anyone seem to get it.  Trump supporters want to be elevated up, by pushin others below them.  It's that simple, some are racist, some are just selfish.  So nothing Trump does really matters to them, unless it's treating people equal, they hate that.",
    "The impact on the deficit should have been analysed by MSM during the election instead of focussing on the salacious. So the Trump base will now lose their health care and pay more taxes. If this was highlighted at the time this mess could've been avoided.",
    "Lol.   Weird.   These people sound a lot like North Korea when they talk about trump.  Can't wait for sedition charges.  \n\n         And the university you used is a university that advertises \"new media\".   They teach you to clickbait stories to get views,  and to manipulate stories to make them more interesting.     It's literally in their commercial.    They literally say in their advertisement that's what you learn .",

Regardless who's in office corporate democrates or currupt republicans they all want more money for the already wealthy. Both parties are corrupted",
    "Simply said, Good for the Rich bad for the Poor, If you work for a living then Trump loves to Poop on you. He would rather benefit those who doesn't work (Cutting inheritance tax), making the rich much much more sustainable to leech the wealth by financial management... how did American a great capitalist country turn to this.. this is like turning in to monarchy and chivalry.",
    "Joe is can speak over Mika, but not visa versa. He even got an apology out of her for her doing the same thing he does. You're a real piece of work, Joe.",

    "jeez he interrupts her 20 times a show, but when she interrupts HIM, he pouts like a baby...  grow up joe - you have two ears and one mouth - use them accordingly...",
    "Just because the show is called Morning Joe should not mean Joe should be allowed to be a blowhard, talk over everybody, including yell at Mika. Why is NBC management not dealing with this rudeness and arrogance? It makes the show much less watchable than it would be otherwise.",

So in a nutshell the corporations will get all the benefits, the wealthy will get a tax cut and the middle class will be tricked into thinking that the doubling of the standard deduction will help when actually they are eliminating the state & local deductions. The middle class does not benefit. It's a shell game.",

The best solution to The GOP Failure to do their job is to vote for Democrats in 2018.  Trump is not the SMARTEST person on Team Trump.

Maybe she needs the money or is waiting for him to die so she can have the camera to herself.  MSNBC is never going to be #1 with personalities like this guy.",
    "The most troubling thing about that 1987 interview compared to Trump today isn't his political opinions. They are troubling because you can see the decline in his expressive language, affect/mood, and cognitive functioning. His lexicon (vocabulary) has decreased to that of a 10 year old, and he uses nonspecific filler nouns, like \"thing,\" and he has a few adjectives that he uses frequently, like \"tremendous,\" which suggests aphasia due to neurodegeneration in temporal lobes. His mood doesn't change much, loss of sense of humor, paranoia, problems reading social contexts/cues from others, impulsivity, memory loss, lack of empathy, etc. That's the frontal lobe. \n\nHe doesn't like stairs and steep inclines, spatial awareness...deterioration in the cerebellum and parietal lobes. \n\nSleep deprivation/insomnia, and those late night/early morning twitter outbursts about random conspiracy theories, poor reasoning/critical thinking, easily frustrated, difficulty separating reality and fantasy, and delusions( refusing to concede when presented with proof that he is wrong--like denying he said something even after being shown a video of himself or tweets he posted)... symptoms of dementia. \n\nHis father suffered from Alzheimer's, and he is close to the age when his father showed symptoms. My own grandma was a very successful business woman who ran an international consortium, marketing professor, she wrote textbooks, published articles in Time mag, etc. we thought she was just a narcissist, but she was actually showing early symptoms of dementia. Because she was very intelligent and well respected, no one intervened for years. By the time she was diagnosed, she was in the throes of dementia. Trump reminds me of her.",

All you have to do is look at their voting records and read the constitution and the law and you will see we clearly have no one in office who represents the government and none of them can hold the office they are in much less any other. They are criminals and that is what the law tells us.\n\n\"The government of the United States... is one of limited powers. It can exercise authority over no subjects, except those which have been delegated to it. Congress cannot, by legislation, enlarge the federal jurisdiction, nor can it be enlarged under the treaty making power\" Mayor of New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662, 736\n\n\u201cAnyone entering into an arrangement with the government takes the risk of having accurately ascertained that he who purports to act for the government stays within the bounds of his authority, even though the agent himself may be unaware of limitations upon his authority.\u201d The United States Supreme Court, Federal Crop Ins. Corp, v. Merrill, 332 US 380-388 L1947)\n\nCooper v. Aaron, By Chief Justice Earl Warren\nNo state, legislator, executive or judicial officer can \u201cWar\u201d against (or test the limitations of) the Constitution without violating their undertaking to support it (Breach of Oath/Contract, Treason??). The Constitution created a government dedicated to equal justice under law. The Fourteenth Amendment embodied and emphasized that ideal\u2026no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Our constitutional ideal of equal justice under law is thus made a living truth. (Book, Our Nation\u2019s Archive \u00a9 1999 pg 701)\n\nAny court, government or government officer who acts in violation of, in opposition or contradiction to the Constitution, by his, or her, own actions, commits treason and invokes the self-executing Sections 3 and 4 of the 14th Amendment and vacates his, or her, office.\n\n\u201d An officer who acts in violation of the constitution ceases to represent the government\u201d. Brookfield Const. Co. v. Stewart, 284 F. Supp.94.\n\nAM14.3/HO, IR No person shall hold office if he rebels against or violates the U.S. Constitution (treason).\n\nAM14.3/RD Congress shall impeach anyone who rebels against or violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nImpeachment is a substitute for assassination.\n\nToday we have a situation where no one is arresting anyone for anything in the government arena. We have laws in place but they are not enforced by those we put in place to enforce them. Since the government only exist by the consent of the people and people no longer consent to what they are doing that does not leave the people with many options. Those options are revolution in which many die that should not have had to die, or assassination in which those assassinated have no court or trial to justify their actions to the people. Thus we have impeachment to protect those in power from assassination and the people from revolution. Today many people are in office who are too stupid to realize this and step down from power willingly or on their own. This forces the hands of the people to either arrest them, revolt and assassinate them or get into another revolution. Assassination is the most logical answer if they will not impeach those who are involved in criminal activity. We are not talking about the assassination of Trump but the assassination of those ( the deep state ) trying to overthrow Trump and our constitutional way of government.\n\nSo I say to you we have a contract, it is called the constitution. It is the SUPREME law of the land, not your statutes or codes, not your acts, agreements or treaties. Congressmen, Senators, Presidents, Judges, Police, and ALL government officials do your job rightly. A generation will come when people invoke their rights and enact their duties to institute new government.\n\nWhenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends [life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness] it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government...  Thomas Jefferson (The Declaration of Independence)\n\nIt seems congress and judges have forgotten who the true boss is. They have gotten too big for their britches and it is time the people show them who the true boss is. They are guilty of treason and you do not have to be a lawyer to figure that one out.\n\n\u201cThe people \u2014 the people \u2014 are the rightful masters of both Congresses, and courts \u2014 not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert it.\u201d \u2013 \u201cAbraham Lincoln, [September 16-17, 1859] (Notes for Speech in Kansas and Ohio),\u201d Page 2.\n\nThe Oath of office is a quid pro quo contract cf [U.S. Const.

Violating their oath is not just cause for immediate dismissal and removal from office, it is a federal crime. Federal law regulating oath of office by government officials is divided into four parts along with an executive order which further defines the law for purposes of enforcement.\n\n5 U.S.C. 3331, provides the text of the actual oath of office members of Congress are required to take before assuming office. 5 U.S.C. 3333 requires members of Congress sign an affidavit that they have taken the oath of office required by 5 U.S.C. 3331 and have not or will not violate that oath of office during their tenure of office as defined by the third part of the law, 5 U.S.C. 7311 which explicitly makes it a federal criminal offense (and a violation of oath of office) for anyone employed in the United States Government (including members of Congress) to \u201cadvocate the overthrow of our constitutional form of government\u201d",

    "J , I'm not thrilled with the President's complaining  about the press too much either, however if you go back through the comments Mika and Joe, and others n the press  have made about him over the last months you might have more sympathy for the President. Mika has taken to talking about President Trump's sexual preferences?!?! Is this a political news show or a gossip fest? For the most part, it seems cruel and more importantly, what is the purpose of it? It cheapens the public discourse. We live in a Representative Republic, we need a civil society built on respect for each other and our views. I for one, don't have time for, or an interest in, commentary  built around name calling. I also am very disheartened when I hear and read Trump and Trump supporters  calling people names. Having written all that, our Republic is built on a peaceful transfer of power when we have an election. I know, the press especially were disappointed when Hillary lost, but Americans accept election outcomes, we support those who hold our views and we work against those we disagree with , but we do it by building evidence and having discussions explaining our side of the issues. While freedom of speech and the press is among the foundational rights in our Constitution, the press can and I think is destroying itself by being irresponsible in not reporting the facts accurately.

Which accomplishes what? hurting the American public and the USA as a whole.Take a good look in the mirror and maybe you might realize that the Country is much more important than your own agenda's.If any of the Democrats actually respected the  electorial process  they would stop humiliating the forgotten middle class who voiced their demand for change and as a result Trump is the President period.",

My position was unpopular even within my own family. I am a veteran of the Vietnam era; Army, drafted, served august 1969 to august 1971; left that service as an E-5 Buck Sergeant. Went to law school on the GI Bill. My opposition was not especially focused on issues of morality, but more on basic history. I saw and experienced what happened in Vietnam.  I saw Iraq as a conflict with no clear defined outcome and particularly no defined exit strategy whatsoever.

Way beyond \"obstruction of justice\": I don't understand why the President's public written statements this week while a federal jury is in place and a trial (USA vs Manafort) proceeding and that jury not sequestered, especially the public written statement directly talking about Paul Manafort, is not \"jury tampering or interference or intimidation of a jury\"? \n\nMy other question: Did the judge instruct the jurors that they cannot use their phones, tablets or platforms such as Facebook or Twitter etc? I only saw a glimpse of transcript of judge's instructions yesterday. Only TV mentioned as far as electronic devices that I saw. Can anyone explain? I remember clearly Nixon's bumble and reaction during the Sharon Tate murders trial. The jury was sequestered then, saved NIxon temporarily! Does no one in media or Wash DC  have long term memory? I'm old, but only my shortterm seems to be affected. ???",

    "First, Bill Clinton is not running for President (I didn't vote for him either time) .\nSecond, Bill was not impeached. The house passed it but the Senate didn't. Not impeached. \nThird, Lewinsky was not raped. She liked it and bragged about it to her coworker who outed them. \nFourth, that administration balanced the budget and was spending down the deficit. \n    The only thing republican administrations have done is put our country at risk economically.",
    "Donnie got shouted down making an important point about the race being between male and female values. Bill Clinton's bimbos were WILLING participants. Trump is saying that he can sexually assault women because of the greater power he has than they do, a vital distinction they missed completely and totally. Trump also violated Hillary's space several times during the debate. Donnie saw that and was shouted down. Try listening instead of constantly interrupting, please. That goes for all the panelists on the show Monday.",
    "Donny Deutsch is a women pecked wimp. Every man, not woman, across America who have been disadvantaged and had their speech curtailed by.feminist political correctness that have made gender a one-sided pro women issue are outraged and fighting back.

    "Donny Deutsch is absolutely right .. why on earth was big mouth Joe stopping him making that point.. I am a white woman and he absolutely hit the nail on the head.  There is no way back for Trump after hearing him on that Hot Mic bragging as a predator.

But if he brags about trying to screw someone's wife - THAT is where the GOP and some of his supporters have suddenly drawn the line.  It isn't how he \"locker room\" talks about other women.  For his blindly misguided and suddenly awakened supporters, it is that he doesn't respect and will go after another man's wife.",

Trump has been in the public eye for how many years? This man is a saint compared to these two! Joy Beher today called BILL CLINTON's victims tramps! Where is the support for these women? where is the out cry for her resignation? Liberals call conservatives dangerous! What a joke!

He roughed her up, interrupted her really disrespectfully, lurked large over her creepily on stage, and then to top it off, threatened to throw her in jail. Clinton's strategists must have been high-fiving each other because Trump managed to humanize her for the first time during this whole election cycle. This election is over folks.",

    "I hate that they call anyone who finds the tape disgusting hypocrites.  Actually not.  I've never thought anything of Kennedy, and I was horrified by Bill Clinton, and, on day one with Trump's stupid wall, I knew I would never vote for Trump.  I don't get Christians backing him.  I find the really dreadful thing is that Trump called the Central Park 5 still guilty after DNA etc. proved them innocent and they were awarded 41 million by the state,..but this weekend, included the debate centered around his sexual bragging.  Yes the tape is disgusting, but so is basically everything about Trump.  He would not be a president.  He would be a tyrant and nothing more.  God save us from this man!!!",
    "Mika is talking about hypocrisy. Trump's behavior at the debate was okay? Do not think so. Forget the tape (if you can), look at his behavior at the debate. \n\nWhat is Joe's point? Did the house not vote to impeach BC? The fact that we are all hypocrites, does not make his 'words' okay.",
    "The private failures of a politician only impact a handful of people; the laws they pass impact millions. That's the distinction to make between Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, and that's why liberals can support the former but hate the latter.",

    "Donny is absolutely correct; every woman who heard that tape and watched the (attempted) physical intimidation by Trump on that stage last night has encountered many \"Trumps\" in their own lives. EVERY woman! Joe talking over and interrupting Donny was disgraceful. I thought Joe had cravenly distanced himself from his good buddy Trump at a certain point but obviously, it wasn't that deep.

    "Donnie is right on the button...! -  I have had the hardest time processing all the disgusting behaviour that I have put up with over the years without complaint, now that the spotlight is on... this is the moment that change needs to happen. Men of Trumps age are the offenders, it is just a behaviour pattern that is not longer appropriate, and collectively women are rebelling. Infidelity is one thing, and if the man is basically kind to women, he is forgiven and his marriage prevails, but Trump is a different kettle of fish... I am well aware of this type of discrimination, and its time to do away with it for good. Thanks Donnie... and Joe, you might want to listen hard to what he and  Micca are saying.",
    "Joe,  you are just not getting Donnie ' s point.  Like everyone else,  I read about Trump's history of philandering and crude comments.  I knew about them already,  but I had an intense VISCERAL reaction to HEARING him say it.  There is something very powerful in hearing a person saying something that just doesn't register when we read about it or hear someone else describe it.  You have to understand, this is how the human nervous system works.  Men and women will have a VISCERAL reaction to the AUDIO and VIDEO of something ,  much more than a printed description.   It's not about political beliefs or affiliation:  it's about how the human nervous system registers information.  What mattered was we SAW & HEARD Mr Trump in that video.  THAT is the difference.  Anybody who reads this post calmly and rationally,  click the thumbs up if you agree.  Since I have posted this in a polite and rational manner,  I will not accept crude or demeaning comments in response.  Please respond only if you are calm, rational, and respectful.  Thank you.",

Hillary's qualifications be damned, they will vote against their own interests.",

I would say that the majority of the population does have a relationship with a female, a woman, a girl,.... be it a friend, a sibling, a partner, a sweetheart, a mother, a daughter, a neighbor, a spouse, a teacher, ....... and these words, this \"banter\", becomes much more personally offensive, possibly within arms reach of the majority of the population.... a relationship whether being a work relationship, acquaintance, physical, mental, sexual, or a loving, caring, nurturing relationship. And the assault, the verbal, the mental assault of Trump's cheap and juvenile rhetoric, is also much more personally offensive, also is within arms reach, of \"that\" someone the majority of the population has a relationship with.",

    "Come on Joe.  This isn't the 1990's.  The world has changed a lot since then.  And Bill Clinton isn't on the ballot.  It's not his character or behaviour that voters are out to scrutinize.  Trump said what he said and it cannot be dismissed as simply words.  And it shouldn't be just about empathy towards women, it's also about raising a generation of boys/men to not be all rapey and creepy like a certain Republican nominee as well.  By defending Trump or deflecting to things that happened 20-100 years ago, you are condoning his behaviour and propagating a dangerous culture of sexual impropriety that is not acceptable...especially in 2016 and beyond.",
    "Joe you want to know where the people who defended Bill Clinton 25 years ago are, most are dead. Joe just can't see how it offends women when people like him brings up what a woman husband did 25 years ago and act like he is the one running and putting the wife in be background.",
    "I- Wow, was not expecting this.  I'd begun kinda tuning into this show, seemed sensical, loved how well she's been defending women over time and then... Did 'Joe' seriously just defend Trump on the basis of 'Bill did stuff'?  Bill is not the opponent, and Trump bragged about being a sexual predator.  I don't Care who else did what, I don't care if there is a whole football team somewhere bragging about sexually assaulting girls,  nothing and no one gives any other human being the right to sexually assault women.  Nothing.  I don't care about what precedents anyone has set - we have whole history books of 'this guy supposedly did this', we don't say 'that means I get to do it too', wrong is wrong is wrong.  And this is about the guy trying to be our president now!  And he's not even running against Bill, he's running against Hillary.  And he STILL hasn't properly apologized for anything.  Christ, and you are defending him based on that?  Seriously??  Ugh.. *walks off to find another show*",

The only reason It got to the press was because her slimey friend recorded their phone conversation. The other women lose credibility sitting along Trump because he makes unwanted sexual advances and degrades women. So it's ok trump does that and they want to stand with a person who says the things he says and what he thinks of women especially if they are not \"beautiful.\"",
    "How can anyone stand ,joe, more obnoxious, is very difficult to find . He asks the guest a question and immediatly talks very loudly  across him . not only is it damned ,rude . But one ends up by not hearing anything just a broughah! of voices . Cant stand the man he should be on \"fox\" news",
    "Donny Deutsch hit the nail on the head. People in the media can be so obtuse sometimes. They just assume Trump wailing on Clinton is effective but with womens' opinions of him, everything he's been doing in the debates - the constant interruptions, shutting Clinton down, the looming around Clinton last night - are magnified 10 times over. Most women would have been so turned off by Trump, nothing he said of actual substance would have properly registered. Why do you think Clinton was so submissive whenever Trump interrupted? When she debated Bernie she was never bothered by him interrupting her - because he didn't have an issue with women. This is how the Clinton machine works. They find a weak spot that resonates and capitalise on it to the fullest without you realising until it's too late.",
    "How many people noticed when Hillary was talking, Trump was standing right behind her  glaring!? It may or may not have been an intimidation tactic, but I think it will resonant with many people.",
    "Donny, I totally agree with the gender war point.  Two additional \"amicus points\":  First, when people say that \"Monica's life was destroyed\", it should be remembered that it wasn't destroyed by her very consensual relationship with Clinton, but by one of the most vicious partisan witch-hunts in recent memory.  Ken Starr destroyed Monica, not Bill Clinton.  Second, in the same way that Trump has alienated the Black community by invoking memories of slavery by demanding that the President of the United States \"show us his papers\", he is now, to your point, alienating women by invoking similar attitudes and throwbacks to a past where women were chattel and overt uninvited sexual passes were considered by many to be \"men being men\".  Think about the uproar over President Bush giving Chancellor Merkel a brief and uninvited shoulder massage, and then imagine the geopolitical carnage of a (very hypothetical) President Trump pulling a box of Tic-Tacs out of his pocket at a G20 session.",
    "something to think about Joe. just because one goose was in the White House and did wrong does not mean we have to have another goose in there to do the same. Clinton did wrong but it's done. let's keep it from maybe happening again with someone like Trump who stated in his voice that he does it, or my guess is did do it. and will probably do so again. he is a liar. and can't be trusted.",

    "Hmmmm .... everyone blows up over what is in essence two guys puffing themselves up in a locker-room conversation, cringe-worthy as it may be. Women do the same amongst each other.\nBut evidence that someone wilfully lies to the public and has no intention on following through on her promises, and discounts a large sway of her opponent's supporters as \"deplorables\" and an equally large sway of her own \"supporters\" - inherited from Bernie - as \"losers\" gets a pass.\nGotta love the main stream media.",
    "Sorry Joe, The behavior of Clinton and Trump may be the same, but the reaction to it has changed. Women have taken a larger role in business, government, politics, and education. Today more women are enrolled in college than men, not so 20 years ago. Women have a developed a louder voice in issues of sexual abuse and violence against women. If you had taken a minute to listen to Donny instead of going off on your own rant of indignation you may have learned something. Donny was not trying to defend Clinton but to point out what is happening today with women voters and how gender is playing a big part in the election He had an excellent point but  once again you played the Alpha Male card and talked over him.This is my Show and I am the boss. You are ruder to Donny than anyone else  on the show and you outright insult him. You pass it off as sarcasm but it is passive aggressive behavior which shows a degree of insecurity in your behavior.",

If school is voluntary, first off, and paid for by responsible adult parents, second off, wouldn't the atmosphere be better? Think about it...\n\nIt's so exciting to live in a country that has been a role model for most other nations on the planet, but when we make huge mis-calculations, we should be humble and rectify our own nation, under God, indivisible, and with liberty and justice for all.\n\nI am not criticizing our past, I'm learning from it.\n\nBecause I did graduate high school, Junior high school and grammar school, by force, and getting bloody noses with the pressure of learning subjects I hated, and consider a waste of time....and taxpayer's money.

These rights are a major factor in what makes America an exceptional nation and a beacon for freedom that attracts people from the world over. Once we begin whittling away at one of our rights in the Bill of Rights, what\u2019s to stop the erosion of the others? Freedom of speech? Freedom of religion? Changes like this wouldn\u2019t be minor tinkering \u2013 they would amount to major disfigurement of America\u2019s foundational document, equivalent to amputating a person\u2019s arm or leg.\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8g",

Years of doing nothing for and not listening to their constituents.  Their time is up !  Love how these young people have turned a tragedy into a triumph of unity and love with the entire Country.",

Now they want to hang the republicans for the Democrats inaction.  Law abiding gun owners aren't the problem.   The state federal and local governments had at least 65 reasons to stop nicholas cruz.  Yet it's the fault of law abiding gun owners?    If sheriff Israel and his cowardly deputies are not willing to put their lives on the line to save innocent lives what good is law enforcement?",
    "So your plan is to \"vote out\" representatives of millions upon millions of people in order to criminalize them, and then what?  You going to FORCE all these people into doing what you demand they do?  So you are planning to impose TYRANNY upon law abiding Americans by criminalizing their Constitutional Rights?\n\nWell, there is a remedy for that specific situation specifically listed in the American Constitution, it's called the 2nd Amendment, and We the People have an unalienable right to bear arms and to defend ourselves from such tyranny.\n\nI know it is next to impossible for liberals to say what they mean becasue they don't know what meaning is and how it works, so I'll do it for you:\n\nWhat you want is a Civil War against We the People, waged by the corrupt Police State and foreign invaders camouflaged as \"illegal immigrants\".\n\nOK then, go ahead and start that, all of the inevitable consequences of domestic war will be on you, as presented at Military Tribunals for treason, and after being found guilty, public hangings will be held in order to offer catharsis to a broken nation, just as it has ALWAYS been done throughout the world where such events took place.",
    "By the time November rolls around, many of the kids will forget about all of this and many will forget to get their absentee ballots. Meanwhile, gun owners will be motivated as always to vote in pro gun politicians. So this flash in the pan will be long over. Little will come of it.",

You are the cannon fodder for their wars, from which they will also earn. You are only the modern slaves who, when they grow up, will have no choice but to have good government.

If you had the slightest clue about American history you would know that the Democrats are the true racist. This party gained most of its control from the KKK and other racist murderers. It was the Republican legislators in the 1860s that ended slavery and made black people equal citizens of the United States. I would call you a racist Bill Maher!",
    "Listening to Bill Maher's attempts to channel the inner thoughts of white, Trump supporting racists shows how foolish this man is.  He takes what is probably a very small group of the population and inflates it to half of the country.  Maher has little clue of how middle America lives or what they think.  Totally glib.",
    "I thought by the headline I might get a chance to mock Bill Maher a little bit for sounding like an arrogant pr!ck, who himself doesn't always see the forest for the racist trees. But Maher is right on about how some Republicans see Obama, and will always see Obama no matter what. He is right that it is only some Republicans - and that number increases significantly per capita when you just look at that section of Republicans.who support someone like Donald Trump. I am mostly referring to the 25,000 or so Donald Trump supporters who consistently attend his rallies all over the country.\n\nI would add that there are a significant number of Democrats who balk at seeing a man of color in the White House, as well. There are crazies on both sides. The moderates on both sides of the political divide need to openly acknowledge that racism in America is institutional. Racism crosses all party lines. The Donald Trump Phenomena,, better than any thing, or anyone, in the past, has (inadvertantly) exposed and separated the 'crazy' Republicans from the 'next door neighbor' Republicans. \n\nDonald Trump drew the crazies out from every corner of the USA. Trump showed us there are no red and blue states, there are only purple states. The crazies literally live everywhere. No one is safe from the crazies, anywhere. Maybe from day one someone (or some organization like the FBI) should have taken pictures of each and every attendee at Trump rallies. Maybe the FBI should have identified the few hundred or so (out of the thousands who attended) who openly, blatantly, and defiantly displayed their racist hearts. Maybe the FBI should have created a registry - a registry akin to the \"No Fly List\". There needs to be serious social consequences  for anyone who proudly states (or displays in any way) their belief that blacks are inferior. Microchip the SOBs!",
    "Keep attacking the GOP Maher! Conservatives want everything to go back like it was in the 1950's and Trump is using this card brilliantly, saying those \"others\" are taking everything away from the white man.

He's been very consistent.  For years, he's made it clear that he's okay with ethnic discrimination.  He even eggs it on.  Is the argument here that Jews in particular should be exempt from that?  I'm not following the argument....",

    "I am not sure what this Jewish angle is all about from the media. I think they are trying to weave this into a general narrative that enforcing the law is racist ergo no refugee ban, open borders, and back to the white man apologizing for all history.. What I do know is that year after year harassment of Jews according to FBI stats has been much more likely than harassment of Muslims. Maybe the left wingers have a flavor of the month thing going because they have never brought up these statistics and expect the president to now apologize for all of this activity some of which we know for a fact is based out of liberal institutions. Antisemitism is definitely not defined by political ideology. I also know there are Jewish groups that are political and would never be happy ever, with what Trump said, because their groups are far left, and it just comes with the territory. I also know the Southern Poverty Law Center has more donation envelopes than publications and have been removed as a FBI resource. Unfortunately based on history we can't be altogether sure that every instance is accurately portrayed, truthful, or not perpetrated by people looking to make negative press. Remember a black man burned down his own church and guess who was blamed for that? We can't simply sift from one narrative to the next with full belief anymore. The media and the left is far too radicalized to believe without scrutiny. They believe Trump is Satan and half the US population is not just wrong, but unAmerican ergo unworthy of the rights they claim to be the champions of. There really is no coming back from that. When you teach people to think like that it may end in violence or bloodshed. If you truly believed half the stuff left wingers are floating out there, the resulting action could be quite extreme.",

    "Comparing Trump's reluctance to say \"Anti-Semitism\" and Obama's refusal to say \"Islamic terrorism\" is a false equivalency. Obama explained that his decision to not use those words when condemning the violent actions of terrorists stemmed from his desire to avoid lumping all Muslims, the vast majority of whom are peaceful, law-abiding, and non-violent, in with those terrorists.

Pence doesn't care, he's still standing next to a man who just yesterday stated he was a nationalist. Let's get one thing clear, a nationalist is not a patriot. A nationalist is a reactionary who's agenda supports only one race of people within his party. They've been getting away with this crap for way too long. The Supreme court screwed us with citizen's united claiming that corporations are people and then again with taking away federal over sight of the 1965 voting rights act requiring the federal government to review any changes made to voting laws in the 9 southern states that were and still are guilty of voter suppression. Since then look at all the states that have changed voter registration and now require ID's to vote. In Georgia if your name is misspelled your name is taken off the registration and you may not be able to vote. Not surprisingly it seems to be affecting mostly minorities and registered democrats. Pence needs to take a long walk off a short pier, he's no better than Trump. Also, for those people who only vote Republican because of abortion or because of taxes need to take a closer look at the new Republican agenda, your being used by them and you have to start asking yourself if the means justify the ends. Do you really want to be part of a Nazi party just so you can have a pro-life ruling in the supreme court handed down by the same people raping women who are the reason why we need abortion in the first place?",

So we should not try to reach out, understand, and have good relations with another powerful country even if we don't agree with how they act or what they do? Matt must think it's fine if we just say Russia is bad and Putin is bad and not see their side of anything. So lets just strong arm and control Russia then because that somehow is supposed to go more smoothly than trying to accept them and work with them. I suppose since we don't watch Russian news or follow their politics Matt thinks that's alright.

There is no threat to America, the only threat is America! America goes with their military into other countries without invitation or UN resolution, that is called invading another country and is against international law.

As for Crimea - 95% of the citizens of Crimea voted to become part of Russia! Why didn't American politicians jump up and shout what a glorious victory it was for democracy! Suddenly Obama and Hillary don't care about the will of the people of Crimea anymore - although they alledge that America must attack other countries to give them democracy - what a joke.

    "If you\u2019re a fading Baby Boomer, you\u2019re faintly amused that the FBI code-named its Trump-Russia investigation \u201cCrossfire Hurricane.\u201d It\u2019s an homage to the Rolling Stones golden oldie \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\u201d \u2014 which, come to think of it, might just be a perfect handle for John Brennan, the former Obama CIA director whose specter hovers over each critical juncture of the case.\nThe young\u2019uns may not believe it, but back before it was known as \u201cclassic rock,\u201d you couldn\u2019t just play your crossfire hurricane on Spotify. You had to spin it. Fittingly, that is exactly what the New York Times has done in Wednesday\u2019s blockbuster report on the origins of the Trump-Russia probe.\nThe quick take on the 4,100-word opus is that the Gray Lady \u201cburied the lede.\u201d Fair enough: You have to dig pretty deep to find that the FBI ran \u201cat least one government informant\u201d against the Trump campaign \u2014 and to note that the Times learned this because \u201ccurrent and former officials\u201d leaked to reporters the same classified information about which, just days ago, the Justice Department shrieked \u201cExtortion!\u201d when Congress asked about it.But that\u2019s not even the most important of the buried ledes. What the Times story makes explicit, with studious understatement, is that the Obama administration used its counterintelligence powers to investigate the opposition party\u2019s presidential campaign.\nThat is, there was no criminal predicate to justify an investigation of any Trump-campaign official. So, the FBI did not open a criminal investigation. Instead, the bureau opened a counterintelligence investigation and hoped that evidence of crimes committed by Trump officials would emerge. But it is an abuse of power to use counterintelligence powers, including spying and electronic surveillance, to conduct what is actually a criminal investigation.\nThe Times barely mentions the word counterintelligence in its saga. That\u2019s not an accident. The paper is crafting the media-Democrat narrative. Here is how things are to be spun: The FBI was very public about the Clinton-emails investigation, even making disclosures about it on the eve of the election. Yet it kept the Trump-Russia investigation tightly under wraps, despite intelligence showing that the Kremlin was sabotaging the election for Trump\u2019s benefit. This effectively destroyed Clinton\u2019s candidacy and handed the presidency to Trump.\nIt\u2019s a gas, gas, gas!\nIt\u2019s also bunk. Just because the two FBI cases are both referred to as \u201cinvestigations\u201d does not make them the same kind of thing.\nThe Clinton case was a criminal investigation that was predicated on a mountain of incriminating evidence. Mrs. Clinton does have one legitimate beef against the FBI: Then-director James Comey went public with some (but by no means all) of the proof against her. In is not proper for law-enforcement officials to publicize evidence from a criminal investigation unless formal charges are brought.\nThe scandal is that the FBI, lacking the incriminating evidence needed to justify opening a criminal investigation of the Trump campaign, decided to open a counterintelligence investigation. With the blessing of the Obama White House, they took the powers that enable our government to spy on foreign adversaries and used them to spy on Americans \u2014 Americans who just happened to be their political adversaries.\nThe Times averts its eyes from this point \u2014 although if a Republican administration tried this sort of thing on a Democratic candidate, it would be the only point.",

They have literally sold their souls, and then continue to preach forgiveness for everyone of his transgressions. I haven\u2019t seen him cure any blind people lately? Has he healed any lepers? If he has, I would wager that he\u2019s created more lepers than he\u2019s cured. What is it about Trump??",

    "As far as white women voting for Trump I think it falls into these categories:\n1.  Evangelicals (who are so upside-down on everything they're just lost)\n2.  Hillary haters (Roseanne hated Hillary)\n3.  Terrified Conservatives who spent the 8 years under Obama binge watching Fox News (brainwashed)\n4.  People terrified of losing the jobs they had and willing to believe anything (desperate and terrified)\n\nIn any case, so desperate, terrified, and/or brainwashed they were willing to vote for a self-serving, misogynistic, serial sexual offender who never had any intention of helping anyone but himself.",

    "How stupid does Roseanne think the American people by not matching his name and that and president took full credit for the show's ratings that was just the people wanna see it and did not know was gonna to be said and the show .   Everyone got to see the show now and the most intelligent people do not wanna watch itknow more I hope they goes off the air by low ratings as saying that Trump would take credit for that  .  Because a lot of these celebrities don't know nothing about real life there all billionaires and don't have a hard time making ends being but the American people do.  This republican attitude is that they got theirs aknow cares about the rest of the people of America and republican politicians just wanna steal from the American people and just want a more and more for their selves and care less about the American people.  And now the American people that care less about the celebrities and worry about reality.",

For the most part, it is socially liberal and Rosanne is the only Trump supporter in the family and among the main cast members involved afaik. I think Trump fanatics expecting a safe space pro-Trump show will be very disappointed and those who don't like Trump will be surprised to find it isn't a propaganda show for Trump as many seemed to have thought it would be.

I think she only cares about what Americans can do for her,  and could care less about anything else. One and a half years later she still attacks American women and her people for not voting for her. Gesh",

We have eyes we can see all the damage she has already done and what Obama done to our country she would have just stepped right in to his footsteps. America keeps showing you all they are tired of it. Roseann's show sky rockets in rating but look at the Golden globes, Country music awards or any other award show all of them was down in ratings more than any year ever in history. Look at the box office with actors and actresses that have been hard core advactes against Trump like J Law. Her last 3 movies have completely flopped. She is supposed to be an A list actress. You all better recognize it is the people that make you an A list actress or a comedian. Look at Kathy Griffin. Should I keep going or will you all finally get the point.

    "She doesn't think much of women. To believe women \"cannot think for themselves\" and \"are under the thumbs of men\" and \"intimidated by Hillary's intelligence\", Bernhard clearly has a very low opinion of women.

So is most of the cast and a large part of the creative writing and producing team.  Bottom line, Roseanne is basically playing herself on the show -- and I can promise you that her family will be butting heads with her on various issues.  Sara Gilbert and Wanda Sykes would not have gotten onboard otherwise.  If the show can depict a loving family with clashing political views, and show them still accepting each other at the end of the day, then I'd say that's a project worth supporting.",

    "I don't care about Roseanne, the show or person, but I think Ms. Bernhard's articulation of women who voted for Trump was off and ignorant. If you've really struggled to be middle class for so long, you'd know that most working class folks don't spend a whole lot of time looking at the political blog-o-sphere, social media, and the outrage machines...because they're working, taking care of kids/loved ones, and working some more. You can call it being \"uninformed,\" but they care about jobs and the micro of everyday life and can't be wholesale put off by rude language from a candidate. It's sad that she still hasn't learned why Trump won and judging by her insistence on self promotion at the end, I can tell she's stuck in her bubble. No doubt there was a toxic bigoted segment of the Trump voters, but it was small and marginal.",

Making a threat against me doesn't make me cower in fear, because I'm a man, not a boy. It only makes me double down, and the majority of the U.S.A. agrees.

By the time the primaries were finished, I was willing to back Trump as a vastly improved choice. I didn't vote for her not because she was a woman. I didn't vote for her not because my husband told me not to. I didn't vote for her because she has been nothing but a force of destruction since the beginning. When I had a choice between black and white, I went black for history sake, and it nearly destroyed America. This time, I looked past their outward appearance and voted for who I thought would actually help America.

Trump skillfully employed racism as wedge issue and once again white middle class voters fell for the Republican lie that \"trickle down economics\" will create more and better paying jobs although it never does and then enthusiastically participated in class warfare on themselves by voting for Trump and Republicans. I'll bet no matter how bad the American economy gets under Trump, Rosanne will never address any of those key issues in her show based on objective facts because Republicans prefer to make up there own \"alternative\" facts these days.",

Religion has a lot to do with it too.  Many religions, if  not all religions, tell women that they have to support and accept their patriarchs.  It is terribly sad.  Mormon women, along with Evangelical women, believe that their only place is in the home and their husbands have dominance over them.  It is nothing more than a type of slavery -- and you NEED to stand up to, and fight, your oppressors.  It will come -- hopefully soon but it may take another 100 years... but it will happen.

    "It is vitally important that we recognize that Trump is planning a coup. He has NO GAINS from disparaging the Chief Justice now. It reverses nothing! What Trump is doing is laying the plans for what happens when stuff related to impeaching the President or indicting his family and cronies is taken before the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court rules opposite to Trump's desires. Trump is trying to get people to take pitchforks and torches into the street and overthrow the government and install him as Absolute Dictator For Life. Trump has NO plan to win fair. Everything Trump does is not so much to BREAK the law, but to SET ASIDE the law so that there is no more law to break anymore. The law will be gone and will be replaced by Trump's Will. This is his only desire. He has absolutely NO plan to win on the merits. He's going to win (he thinks) by mob coup. What he doesn't realize is that only 30% of the people will be with him. If he were a brilliant (but evil) strategist like Stalin or Hitler he could leverage that 30% to take control of the machinery of law, but he's NOT that brilliant. His choice not to co-opt the machinery of law but to wreck it absolutely will not work because his Base is such an overwhelmed minority against the 70% of us who will exterminate those thugs. But we have to PREPARE for this. The people who DON'T want to live by rule of guns must start stockpiling guns and we need to have meetings to discuss the morality of killing our pro-Dictatorship neighbors if that is what it comes down to and, through no fault of our own, that is the only way to prevent mass extermination camps like Nazi Germany's. We should lay the MORAL framework for such killings -- the LEGAL framework is besides the point, since pretty there's just not going to BE any such thing as \"law\" anymore.",

It is refreshing that you're being honest about something for a change!  The entire purpose of the judiciary branch of government is to provide a system of checks to help balance out potentially harmful inclinations of the other branches of government.  That's why our founding fathers set it up in the first place.  If the courts are \"not helping\" you, then that's a clear indication that some of your actions are heading into unconstitutional, unlawful, or simply moronic directions.  How is it that you are actually stupid enough to see that as a flaw in the judiciary, rather than recognizing it as a flaw in *you* ?  Time to grow up, tRump...or step down.",

He wants to come across as a victim of false news reporting and states he is a \u201cgreat\u201d leader who is being mercilessly slandered. It is regrettable that so many people in the United States are duped by this ploy and will only listen to talk radio and television stations that unrealistically paint President Trump as a hero of the people. Some may excuse the president\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric about the media, but just because the president does not like news coverage does not make it fake. And a president preventing a free and independent press from covering the workings of our republic would be a criminal assault on the First Amendment!...A real Man a real President without doubt would have gone and seen the American military dead no matter what the weather, the confederate republicans and fox Nazi news would have gone ballistic and would have required President Obama head on a Plata if he had said he's not going to the American war graves in France because of wind and rain...tell me why does the drumpf always get away with everything. The drumpf is big on the military but cannot even attend the American cemetery off the fallen heroes, the liar in chief drumpf should be a shame. He gets away with it (for the moment) because the Republican majority in the Senate, without regard for the welfare of the people, would rather be senators in a dead country than retired senators in a living, functioning country.  They are in flagrant violation of their oath of office, perjurers in retrospect.  They have no redeeming social or governmental qualities or capabilities which are not canceled out by their greed, avarice, and indifference to the welfare of the people. i gotta say finish social media has never been as entertaining as it was yesterday. someone posted a picture of a tree branch with just one leaf left, saying \"just waiting for that last leaf to fall so i can rake it. any minute now\" and i just about died laughing.",

    "There are three primary complications that make Syria such a difficult problem: 1) Russia. The Syrian government (Bashir al-Assad's faction) have been Russian clients for 50 years. Russia has used their influence to try and stop international action against Assad, and since they are now directly involved, things become even trickier. Attempting to destroy the Syrian Air Force, even on the ground, would probably kill Russian military personnel, and that's an act of war. We're low on leverage with Russia as it is (thanks to Ukraine) and any end result that doesn't have al-Assad controlling the country means Russia loses their client state, so pretty much any solution acceptable to us is unacceptable to them. 2) ISIS. Though it might not be QUITE as big of a risk now (as ISIS is weakening), if we'd broken the back of Assad's forces any time before this, ISIS would simply exploit the vacuum and become even more powerful. Assad's claim that he's fighting ISIS is pretty much a lie (his plan the entire war has been to eliminate every other rebel group first), but the fact remains that his faction has not been the greatest threat to the West, which makes it harder to do anything. 3) Factionalization. If Assad is overthrown or agrees to go into exile, we don't have a replacement government both acceptable to us and capable of controlling the country. Obviously putting ISIS in charge is out of the picture, and we don't want any al-Qaeda-esque groups like al-Nusra, so that leaves the Kurds (who are unlikely to be able to control the whole country and don't want to anyways) and the Free Syrian Army (who are relatively weak as rebel groups go and would have difficulty establishing dominance). With the rebels split fighting each other and ISIS, they haven't been able to do much to actually end the war. This war started with no good options and then took those and replaced them with worse options. That's simply the nature of the conflict. No matter what we did, a lot of people were going to die and it would somehow all be our fault.",

IS could be crushed quite quickly, but what then? A new monster might rise, its a cesspol of criminals and jihadists, the \"moderate\" rebels that are being supported might rise from the ashes. US could take care of Assad and IS tomorrow if they wanted to, but then there is the thing with unintended consequences, Joe is it short sighted here. Especially when it comes to Assad i dont agree with him. \nAssad is perhaps the only stabile force left in the region, yes he is a scumbag, but so was Saddam, and things were better with him there.  Take him out would be a bad idea.\nHillary is a warhawk, and Trump is a lunatic, so whatever they decide to do in Syria is not going to make it any better. Having said that, its been a slow process, but IS is losing at a steady rate. IS will be destroyed eventually, but after that, some new extreme group might take the baton and continue the bloodshed. Lets hope not.",

Should British troops aid the standing US government or the citizens who rebel?  It's their country.  Let them sort out their own problems.  Sending \"humanitarian aid\" is one thing, but bombing their Air Force is an act of aggression.  Haven't we learned our lesson yet?  or are you calling for another \"excuse\" to go to war in the the Middle East?  It just seems that we could do with a few years of fixing our own country before we go to war with ourselves.",

    "Seems to me Mr. Trump you are the one trying to pretend to be a friend to the African-American for votes. After all who's the one with 1% of the African- American vote? Wonder how that happened in the first place? Why the sudden change 500 days into your run? Maybe your people are actually now caring about what the polls (people) say. Too little, too late. BTW, we've all regretted things but that doesn't mean we always apologize for those things. Sometimes we just regret the consequences. That doesn't mean we want forgiveness. Big difference and I applaud your speech writers for being so vague as to what you regret. Now your mouth-pieces can use that statement to defend all your past insults. Let him admit in Public that Sen. McCain is a hero and sacrificed for our country. Let him admit he didn't sacrifice like the Kahn family because while their son was overseas fighting and dying for our country his kids were hunting animals in Africa or something like that. I could go on with the many things you have said that offended me and my loved ones and I wonder which ones you regret or blame on the media for \"taking out of context.\" Another remark in your speech tonight. So many contradictions. And as for your many followers, most I have encountered can only defend you by attacking Hillary. Hillary's mistakes don't erase yours. \"They started it\" isn't the answer to any question for anyone over the age of 5. And being an outsider is a fallacy, your entire first term is going to be spent learning the business of politics and then you have a Congress and Supreme Court looking over everything you do. All your radical ideas won't get past the Constitution and you'll just end up a puppet President pushing the normal Republican agenda. For there to be dramatic change to truly happen in our government it has to happen in all branches at the same time. Most people in congress, Democrat and Republican, don't support many of your radical policies and they won't get passed. I can't get passed the things you have said, with or without apology. Some things you can't take back no matter how much you regret them. By the way \"politically correct\" in government is called \"diplomacy\" and is a very important job of the President. It's one way of protecting our country.",

By taking into account their past and present and possible future, we wouldn't have too much to lose in attacking North Korea, because simply it is an old remnant of WW2 that we could have won anyways. The implications should be precisely calculated for that the reunification that will happen afterwards will pose a threat to mainland Chinas regime and we will be have a democracy touching Russia as well, both who pursued different routes of the same regime with one collapsing, but might try and undermine the north. The north might continuously be undermined for that the unification will be greater than that of the East and West Berlin unification (I have links to scholarly articles if needed).

    "As a former Marine and Vietnam Vet I think Kelly has disgraced the uniform. He has sold out his honor in favor of becoming a toady for Trump, a boot kicking simpleton. He doesn't represent the honor of the Corps. He represents a dictatorial menace to our democracy.  He has violated his oath to protect and defend the Constitution in favor of protecting Trump.",
    "The reason why we were fooled about John Kelly can be related to the Theory of Relativity. You see, an ant is a pretty slow animal. Yes! Compared to a human who covers many feet in a second an ant covers maybe an inch per second. But relatively to most insects (and its own size) an ant is actually pretty fast. That's how we got fooled by John Kelly. He is standing next to atrocious human beings. If someone has a 2 inch nose, if he stands next to people with 3 inch noses, he looks good. But take him all alone and look at him again all alone or with people who have only 1 inch noses. Then you realize that he is actually a monster. Trump and his crew are beyond despicable. Kelly is just VERY despicable. A 5 year old in charge of a 4 year olds' daycare.",
    "It seems to me, the American public seems to have some weird perceptions of what/who military men and women are. I've served alongside some of the best people I've ever known, and I have served alongside some deplorable people as well.  John Kelly is a man.... a human being.... he is not someone we should place on a pedestal and pretend he can do no wrong. He has shown himself to be a man with little 'honor' or morals.  It is what it is..... His time in service of this country is to be respected.... but he is not.",
    "Among other facets, which\u00a0Lawrence O'Donnell has already pointed out in earlier segments on John Kelly, this one was very interesting because it shows best how not only the Republican/Trump base is driven by dreams, fantasies, and wishful thinking. Indeed,\u00a0liberals in the United States are obviously no strangers to making assessments, or\u00a0passing\u00a0judgements, based on fantastical hopes, or surreal fears. John Kelly didn't just change suddenly when he entered the Trump administration, first to lead the DHS then to lead-organize the day-to-day business of the Trumpian White House. No, apparently he just keeps meeting the\u00a0behavioral, and political\u00a0expectations of the particular institution he's currently\u00a0working for. But the slanted political demands, or needs, of the Trump presidency make it impossible for him\u00a0not to appear at odds with the appearance he's given himself while rising through the ranks of the military. Mob rule as enacted by the current, highly partisan,\u00a0Republican administration requires\u00a0to repeatedly\u00a0prove your loyalty, and to not waver when faced with the consequences. In an environment like this\u00a0to apologize for evident wrong-doing would not\u00a0only be seen as sign of weakness, but worse, of disloyalty. In my opinion Lawrence O'Donnell has gone to great lengths to rectify his much too positive, dreamy picture of John Kelly when faced with behavior irreconcilable with it.\u00a0That's something to be admired, and it clearly\u00a0distinguishes him not only\u00a0from President Trump's base. Kevin Cullen has belatedly tried\u00a0to do the same. But even though he very openly demonstrates how wishful thinking can cloud one's judgement, up till now he apparently is just disappointed in, or bewildered by, the contradictions having manifested themselves\u00a0in John Kelly's `new\u00b4 demeanor. That already is commendable, but it's not enough.",
    "As a vet I can telly you there are many that may have served \"honorably\" and \"rose through the ranks\", but that doesn't make them good people at all.  Anyone would would with/for Trump is in principle on the bad people list, period.  That's not even up for debate.",
    "Kevin Cullen, Boston columnist, unfortunately, is part of the problem.  After all that he said, he ended with make-believe and giving Kelly a \"pass\".  He still said, he thought \"John Kelly - Empty Vessel Extraordinaire, was honorable.  He tried to fit Kelly to his mislabeling of him.  He further errored and Lawrence had to stop him - failed in his do-good speech by saying Congresswoman Frederica Wilson did not matter.

    "Nothing happened to Kelly. The cliche' \"birds of a feather flock together\" gives insight into this guy's character. Trump is a vile and despicable human no doubt about that but he didn't make Kelly.

He went on to talk about honoring women but referred to the black congresswoman as an empty barrel, that told us who this guy was.

All he'd be able to tell him are the questions and answers asked of him,  and they could have shown him some sort of evidence -- but it would be evidence Manafort already knew about or they wouldn't ask him questions about it. That session with the grand jury didn't go into anything except matters that pertain to Manafort.\n\nBut we really need to know how any kind of information in Manafort's possession could possibly have been conveyed to Trump.

Intent for the pardon matters. A lot. \n\nRemember\u2014we still have criminal laws that limit what anyone, including the President, can do.\nIf the pardon power is used with criminal intent then, no, the pardon power is not unlimited. \n\nThe pardon power can, for example, be used for obstruction of justice, which is a serious crime.\nWhat the pardon power has not been is tested in the courts. And that is because the vast majority of the men who have become President have been reasoned, sincere, honorable, stable, law-abiding men. So there\u2019s been very little reason to question or doubt the intent of the vast majority of pardons issued by Presidents.\nA few bad apples have snuck in, Nixon being the most notable example. He would\u2019ve used the pardon power if he could\u2019ve gotten away with it during Watergate.\nAnd now we have Trump, who is itching to use the pardon power to liberate Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager who has been rightfully convicted by a jury of his peers for 8 serious crimes. \n\nTrump, if he does pardon Manafort, would be getting seriously close to pardoning to obstruct justice. \nBut what is stopping Trump is that if Manafort is pardoned, he also loses his 5th Amendment right to be free from self-incrimination. \nThat means that Mueller and the DOJ can get back to Manafort and press him to disclose all the details he has of the Trump campaign in 2016, and how they contacted or coordinated with Russian agents.\n\nSo, for Trump this pardon situation will get mighty bad mighty quick if he exercises his pardons in a very stupid, reckless way.",

I can only hope that the current system will be changed following the horrific things I am leaning about parties work  This election is certainly calling attention to the ridiculousness of the established system as it exists..I am fed up with both parties as are many in America  The media has become a propaganda machine. Change in the current establishment needs to happen and it wont be easy but all the lies in the world cannot stop it. No matter who wins the election there will continue to be demand for change from the people  Bernie supporters know the path to change is through unity and truth.This is not a violent movement and the implication that passionate beliefs in justice are equivalent to violent behavior is just another smear on the part of those who want to draw attention away from real issues and injustice.. I know they enjoy the benefits of supporting corruption but that is poisoning their hearts and minds.  so sorry you betrayed many who trusted you including me  as it is also a betrayal of yourself",
    "Either Maddow wasn't listening to The Big Chair and only heard what she wanted to hear, or she just didn't have time to put his feet to the fire. He was saying its okay to hoot and holler in rallies, but the meetings between now and the DNC in July \"are quasi legislative.. a lot of serious business goes on..\" IOW he doesn't believe hooting and hollering are appropriate. He wants to control how the people in the room behave while they go through the ritual of sticking Bernie's head on a pike and crowning Hillary Clinton. If the Sanders supporters don't increase their hooting and hollering at this point, they lost before they started. \n\nTBH i've been saying they lost before they started since the beginning. The fix has been in from the beginning with Clinton's \"super delegates.\" Bernie never stood a snowball's chance in Houston, and many people are still not realizing this. No one has the right to be surprised by any of this, and yet they are. The writing has been on the wall since 2008. Clinton bowed out for Obama with an understanding she'd get her time eight years later. It's eight years later and no one else inside the democratic party seemed to want to go against her. \n\nBernie has had his entire career to do what he's doing now. Why now? I can't help but feel he's got some ulterior motivation to keep her out, even if it means letting Trump have it, just to stop the first First Lady becoming a president. That's the real question nobody's asking Bernie. Why now? Has he ever tried for the presidency before this year? Why now?",

    "Dear Mr Scarborough and distinguished guests, Isn\u2019t it remarkable that when China is unhappy with US policy i.e. the South China Sea debacle, that suddenly Kim Jong il gets into a hyper-war mongering state-of-mind and starts firing missiles six ways from Sunday? Aren\u2019t we really going to wake up to the fact that North Korea is a proxy governmental puppet for China? Kim Jong il is a de facto provocateur that China uses like a trained falcon. The big winner is China. It walks away from this circus with complete impunity from any blame. Like the wizard of Oz, behind its rice-paper curtain it is able to deter its neighbors or the USA interfering with their hegemony in south east Asia by having North Korea use bombastic nuclear rhetoric and send rockets flying as close as it can to frightened countries near to them. They (the Chinese) have prepared a finely woven trap to lure in a hot-headed President Trump into firing first after North Korea sends bogus missiles flying towards Guam. When the US reacts and sends the North Koreans a return salvo, China will release their million-man army to reign in the region grabbing Taiwan first and then confronting American military aggression with justification in saying that they are only defending their ally. It\u2019s only a theory, but it looks that way from here in Europe.",

We did not go to war with Russia during the Cold War, not simply because of mutually assured destruction, but because we are old allies. the us and Russia have no reason to fight.  There is no bad blood, new or old between the US and Russia.  We are secret long, old friends who abhor fasco-socialism.  The Cold War ended when they gave up the command economy.  What they are trying to do now is fight the globalist Democrats.  Now, it is unconstitutional for conservatives to allow attacks on our people, but you all forget why we have the bill of rights; gods are evil, and contemporary weapons of war must be born upon the people in order to keep a free society from the tyranny of government.  So, I should care about people in my country and protect them from invasion, but when you invade my home with your tyranny and defecate on the constitution, it\u2019s hard to say who to fight.  \nThe connection between Russia and the US is deep, old, and goes beyond governmental forms.  People say the Cold War was not real.  Well, if it wasn\u2019t, then it was to build up 2 members to form a security council.  \nI think it was real, and nobody fired first because Russia and America don\u2019t really want to go to war.  Russia is like Americas big sister, it\u2019s a warrior thing.  They\u2019re on the other side of the world.\nRussia was part of the allies!\nYou liberals do not understand that Russia would have attacked us if we elected Clinton.  Democrats attacked Russian bases before the election.  We do not like the GOP much better. We do not want warmongering totalitarianism of Bushes.

You're a fool if you think that driving Kim Jung Un to desperation through sanctions will end badly only for Kim and North Korea, especially with the nuclear weapons and military force he has at his disposal. Even if it ultimately comes to nothing, it's far better that Trump and Kim Jung Un deescalate tensions through detente than continue to ratchet up the pressure in a dangerous game of brinkmanship, as was successfully done in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Two purportedly less-than-stable men with nukes talking peace is preferable than the alternative.\n\nAnd only an arrogant imperialist thinks that the Iran deal, which is accomplishing what it set out to do -- stop the  manufacture of nuclear weapons in Iran -- is a bad deal.",
    "What the left is finding out is that Trump runs the whole show-- not Steve Bannon, not Stephen Miller, not Gary Cohn. No one cares. Mika is insufferable--- the significance is not that Trump accepted a dinner date with Kim Jong Un, it's that Kim Jong Un expressed that he would be willing to denuclearize and will cease all further missile tests until they meet face to face. He also said that he understands that US/South Korean military drills will continue during this time. Take the uncertain details out of the picture and isolate that fact that he expressed that he will stop testing missiles/understands that US/South Korean military drills will continue. He also acknowledged that he \"just wants an assurance of security\" from the United States--- if he wasn't serious, this is a humiliating concession because it implies that he worries about us attacking them. We are seeing a human side of this guy who, until this point, has seemed all but unreasonable and possibly mentally ill. So no Mika, the news is not that Trump accepted the meeting with Kim Jong Un, or that people were \"caught off guard\" and upset by Trump and it's unfortunate that you chose to spin it that way.",

And by all accounts, they have complied with the agreement.  Even better, it re-established some diplomatic ties between Iran and the west.\n\nAnd it wasn't an Obama deal - it was a deal hashed out with a whole bunch of other countries too.  And it was a deal so \"bad\" those countries have insisted they will try to continue with it, even if Herr Trumpenfuhrer unilaterally pulls the United States out.",

They've starved their own citizens (even convincing them Americans are cannibals and must be destroyed) all to develop nukes while using diplomacy as a tool to bide time, getting closer and closer each opportunity.\n\nIn order for any of this to work they have to agree to let inspectors into their country to find the weapons and enforce compliance. The inspections have to be thorough and unannounced. They have to allow medicine and aid into the rural areas with agencies to make sure Kim isn't taking it for himself. North Korea has to agree to relinquish ALL of their chemical, biological and nuclear stockpiles and begin a formal truce to negotiate an end to the war. If these are not done *immediately,* all this is to me is empty headlines and photo-ops.",

This is particularly important when you consider that some of trump's associates, past and present,  have been investigated and charged with Money Laundering.  \n\nThis leads me to wonder if Kim, along with Putin and some of the leaders of that group of 20 +/-  will suddenly become friends of trump and America as well.

    "Once again, President Trump has embarrassed the diplomatic and political establishment by succeeding where they have failed for decades.  The surprise announcement yesterday outside the Oval Office by South Korea's national security adviser Chung Eui-yong that Kim Jong-un is seeking a meeting with President Trump \"as soon as possible\" is a strong indication that President Trump has already won the first step toward fixing the problem he inherited from his predecessors in the Oval Office.\nThere are three reasons why this is a vindication of Trump's policy of ratcheting up sanctions and military pressure, up to and including interdiction of shipping into North Korean harbors.\nKim is the one making the request, and he is doing so with some urgency.  As anyone who understands the dynamics of negotiation understands, this places Kim in the position of supplicant.  The current situation is unacceptable to him, which means he needs something \u2013 almost certainly relaxation of the sanctions that are crippling North Korea (unlike previous sanctions that they were able to work around with the help of China, which evidently has followed through in pledges negotiated by Trump to cut off North Korea from such help).\nNorth Korea has made a concession before the talks: halting missile launches and nuclear tests.\nNorth Korea has dropped is usual demand that the U.S. and South Korea halt their scheduled joint military exercises as a condition for talking.  Those exercises were postponed in honor of the recent Winter Olympics but will resume.  The exercises not only sharpen the ability of the two nations' militaries to work together, but also mass a considerable force within striking distance of North Korea, which is perceived as a threat, carrying the possibility of a sneak attack.\nPresident Trump is the first occupant of the Oval Office to apply the famous definition of insanity attributed to Einstein \u2013 that it is \"doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\" \u2013 to North Korea's drive to become a nuclear power.  The bipartisan political establishment has absolutely failed to restrain North Korea from developing a nuclear arsenal and the means to deliver it to the United States, and now, as that country on the brink of realizing its dream, President Trump has tried something different.  And he has shown results.\nThe comparison with Bill Clinton's farcical failure to halt North Korea's nuclear program with billions of dollars of bribes could not be starker.  Savor the fatuousness of this 1994 announcement that ranks with the notorious \"peace in our time\" declaration of Neville Chamberlain, after appeasing Hitler and making World War II inevitable.\nNow, make no mistake: there is no guarantee that the forthcoming talks will be successful.  But the framework is far more favorable than for any other previous negotiations with the Norks.  They must realize that Trump is a different kind of president from the ones they have been able to lie to and extort and bamboozle while they keep going toward an effective nuclear strike force capability.  All of the many critics who fretted that President Trump could blunder our way into nuclear war have egg on their faces.\nRead more: https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2018/03/three_reasons_why_north_koreas_offer_of_direct_talks_is_a_victory_for_trump.html#ixzz59GTcOC44 \nFollow us: @AmericanThinker on Twitter | AmericanThinker on Facebook",

That's why Rex is doing what he wants to the State Department and IT\"S BAD!  People are quitting right and left because he doesn't know what he's doing either.

    "A spokesman representing 10 Downing Street made a statement that Britain First, is a far right extremist group and that Donald Trump was wrong to redistribute material from a group that promotes hateful narratives.  Is the British Government starting to realize and acknowledge that Donald Trump is a right wing extremist and racist who hates Muslims, Mexicans, and anyone who isn't white and is willing to promote hateful narratives to support his cause?  \n\nTheresa May stated that the British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far-right which is the antithesis of the values that Great Britain represents; which are decency, tolerance and respect.  The statement from 10 Downing Street went on to state that Britain First seeks to divide communities through its use of hateful narratives and uses falsehoods to stoke tensions.  \n\nThat statement by 10 Downing Street about the far right extremist group Britain First could just as accurately been said about Donald Trump and the entire Trump Presidency.  From the campaign trail to the present day Trump administration, Donald Trump has made statements intended to divide our communities through his use of hateful narratives and the use of falsehoods to stoke tensions within American communities!\n\nWhat sets the far right politics and hateful, divisive rhetoric of Donald Trump apart from the politics of the far right extremist group Britain First?                               \n\nDonald Trump and his far right politics of hate and extremism is reminiscent of Hitler's Germany where the press was silenced, and anyone who wasn't considered to be racially pure were labeled, attacked, imprisoned and murdered for nothing more that not meeting the criteria set forth by Donald Trump, I mean the criteria of Adolph Hitler.  It has been reported that Donald Trump's ex-wife stated that Donald Trump kept a copy of Adolf Hitler's speeches in a bedside table that he would read.  Is Donald Trump an admirer of Adolf Hitler?\n\nIt appears that Donald Trump's hatred of non-white people may very well be rooted in his German heritage that he has worked so hard to hide.    \n\nDonald Trump is the most dangerous person in America!  \n\nDonald Trump is a racist, a liar, and a self-serving con man, who hates and that is dangerous to the foundation of our Constitution and our democracy!  It is time for the Republican party to put COUNTRY FIRST!  This isn't a game that Donald Trump is playing, anymore, than it wasn't a game that Adolf Hitler played when he committed atrocities against the Jews and convinced a nation that what he was doing was right and in the best interest of Germany.  The leaders and members of the Republican party, just like the members of the First Reich before them, are being lured into a false sense of right and wrong.  There were strong supporters of Adolf Hitler who were charged and convicted of war crimes and I predict there may be many members of the Republican party who will be charged and convicted of crimes against America when the American people finally realize how zealous, dangerous and anti-American Donald Trump and his regime are to the very fabric of democracy in America!  \n\nI ask Mike Pence and our Republican Congress, which side of history will your name become synonymous?  Will your name go down in History with the names of men like Benedict Arnold, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini and Vladimir Putin or will you be remembered like such men as Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington?  It is time for the members of Congress to put COUNTRY FIRST and stand up to this wannabe dictator who is not fit to hold the Office of the President of the United States.  \n\nThe time has come to invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States before this country is divided to the point of civil war and ceases to be the country we love and call home!",

    "Blame NY Military Academy, Fordham University, and jumbled chromosomes for Trump's grammar and spelling mistakes. \"Pumpkin Head\" did not study Composition 101 & 102 at Penn; instead, he studied it at Fordham. That's verified by the fact that Trump completed his freshman and sophomore years at Fordham, transferred to Wharton, and then, bluffed and bullshitted his way through Penn's Wharton School of Real Estate. My guess is that Trump would have flunked out of Penn had he taken Freshman Comp 101 & 102 at an Ivy League University.\nIf \"Comp\" didn't send \"Pumpkin Head\" home, Penn's foreign language 101 & 102, and Calculus 101 & 102 would have. Fordham must have sucked worse than Wharton Real Estate during the mid 60's. PS: the absolute funniest thing on Trump's resume is that he has a degree in Economics from Penn. Ha! Ha! Ha! Wharton gave those away like Halloween jelly beans after they ditched the Real Estate program. \nThe proof is in Trump's AP, NYT, and WSJ interviews. Clearly, Trump doesn't know which side of the ledger the debit and credit numbers go. Not only that, but also, Trump doesn't know the difference between the integral and the differential. He can't analyze any economic function. The only thing Trump knows about the classical \"Guns & Butter Graph\" is that you eat butter, and shoot guns.  By the way, Professor Kelly, one of Penn's top professors, called Trump, \"the dumbest, g*d damned student I ever had.\" Kelly, Romney, Cruz, and Tillerson were all correct about Trump.

As a negotiator, Trump now has zero credibility with Congress. Any bipartisan compromises on legislation will have to be negotiated without Trump's interference and must be robust enough to survive a veto by a petulant Trump. \n\nTrump keeps doing all the wrong things and does not know how to function in the DC political world -- he just knows how to cater to his racist, poorly educated, resentful, blue collar base. Every time he tweets or makes a statement to the press that involves name-calling/insulting someone famous, or makes an assertion contradicting a previous statement he has made or yet again repeats a well-refuted lie, he just looks paranoid, racist and ignorant.

The concept is not entirely wrong, a president is in essence an administrator, but we should be concerned with the type of administrator. There are many economics and market theories to cite here, and the one that applies the best to Trump is \"Porter\u00b4s 5 Forces Model\", this model introduced in the late 70s is in essence antagonistic. The clients, the suppliers, the alternatives they are all elements that the CEO needs to fight with. Sounds familiar? \n\nIn our current times new more advanced methods, that have build over Porter\u00b4s ideas, have surfaced. These methods put focus on collaboration between the actors, they encourage the creation of close and holistic relationships, adding value to the overall environment where everybody coexists (Delta Model, Holistic Marketing).\n\nCollaboration and mutual grounds are the backbone of the current world. Nationalism doesn\u00b4t fly very far with the way the current world works. It might look patriotic, but is ultimately shortsighted.\n\nAsk yourself, Does Donald J.

While I applaud you going after Trump, you are conspicuously silent on the criminal dirt on Hilary and Obama.  Shouldn't America know the truth about ALL  these MONSTERS ? I think the answer to that is YES.

Why don't you mention the criminal conspiracy within tObama's FBI , DOJ , CIA.?",
    "The left has weaponized the FBI and Muller. The unanswered question here is how is it that Muller found this so called probable cause, if he isn't investigating that same material himself. He has been searching for some way of going after Trump no matter what it is, and then separate him from his counsel. What has Stormy got to do with Russia that prompted Muller to investigate it to the point of probable cause? What do Taxi medallions to do with Russia that Muller has had to investigate it and THEN hand it off? None of any of these items has anything to do with Russia, but Muller has handed them off to someone else to make it look like he isn't interested? Just what is Muller doing that brought such items to his attention, and what do they have to do with Russia and the election, that caused this line of inquiry to even get started? All of this is a sham to get everything Trump has ever done all his life and allow unfettered access to all of Trumps records without any constitutional protections for the president. They have nothing on the Russia probe, so they will strip the president to his underwear or less, looking for anything they can, to destroy him. The irony here is that Trump was ridiculed during the campaign for talking about Russian interference, and now the left is trying to destroy him with that same narrative. Muller has gone far afield to find this so-called \"evidence\" to be turned over to someone else. He doesn't care how Trump is taken down, directly or indirectly. I would really like to know why Muller is investigating Stormy, in a Russian probe investigation? Perhaps Muller can interview some of Trumps kindergarten classmates to see if there are any recess infractions he can scrape together for some additional probable cause.",
    "Mostly the rich took the White House and Cabinets, but Trump said \"it wasn't anything a poor person could do for him in his Cabinet.\" But it's interesting the rich is the ones less conversative when it comes to spending tax payers money.

    "A good question Rosenstein won't answer.  Rosenstein is satisfied with Mueller, and why shouldn't he be?  The two go back a long way and cooperated in the cover-up of an FBI investigation into Russia's use of bribes, kickbacks, and money-laundering to grab U.S. uranium supplies and real collusion with Hillary Clinton, only to resurface years later to chase phantom collusion between Team Trump and Russia.\nMueller and Rosenstein were both involved in the FBI investigation dating back to 2009, with current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, as noted, up to their eyeballs in covering up evidence of Hillary's collusion, bordering on treason, with Vladimir Putin's Russia:\nPrior to the Obama administration approving the very controversial deal in 2010 giving Russia 20% of America's Uranium, the FBI had evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were involved in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering in order to benefit Vladimir Putin, says a report by The Hill[.] ...\nJohn Solomon and Alison Spann of The Hill: Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show[.] ...\nFrom today's report we find out that the investigation was supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, who is now President Trump's Deputy Attorney General, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who is now the deputy FBI director under Trump.\nRobert Mueller was head of the FBI from Sept 2001-Sept 2013 until James Comey took over as FBI Director in 2013. They were BOTH involved in this Russian scam being that this case started in 2009 and ended in 2015.\nIf evidence of bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money-laundering in the Uranium One affair were not grounds for a special prosecutor assigned to investigate Hillary Clinton, what is?  Rosenstein's goal apparently has long been to shield Hillary Clinton from prosecution for her crimes and to use any means to bring down the Trump administration he supposedly was appointed to serve.  Now he has stooped so low as to employ a fake Russian dossier in a witch hunt the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy could only envy\nRosenstein, Mueller, McCabe, et al. have used the office of special counsel and a politicized FBI and DOJ to conduct a silent coup against a duly elected president and are unindicted coconspirators in Hillary's crimes and should be the targets of their very own special counsel.\nRod Rosenstein should be the target of an investigation, not the overseer of one.  Maybe the question before us is not whether a second special counsel is needed, but whether one is needed to investigate just Rod Rosenstein and his Deep State activities.  One wishes Mr. Huber luck.  He will need it.\n\n\nRead more: https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2018/03/can_huber_investigate_his_boss_rosenstein.html#ixzz5BuYc1Obq \nFollow us: @AmericanThinker on Twitter | AmericanThinker on Facebook",

Because he is being investigated for being one of four people who lied to the FISA court and got a Warrant to spy on an American citizen Carter Page and the Trump Campaign. Boente along with James Comey, Sally Yates, and Rod Rosenstein committed perjury by omission. All four submitted a FISA Warrant renewal application PRIMARILY using a \"salacious and UNVERFIED\" opposition research document bought and paid for by Hillary and the DNC and and submitted it as Valid intelligence.

    "Maddow, as usual, is utterly clueless.  #1 \"The Russian Scandal\" isn't a scandal, at least not as far as Trump's campaign is concerned -- the Hillary campaign, in the other hand, is closely tied to the Russians due to their involvement in the Steele dossier and how it was used to get illegal warrants which violated federal law -- a huge felony to lie to a federal judge to get a warrant.  #2 The warrant wasn't just for Cater Page.  It was a warrant for surveillance on two levels of contact with Carter Page.  That means anyone Page MAY have had contact with and anyone THOSE people may have had contact with -- that's a huge and very wide range for a surveillance warrant.\n\nAlso, kinds cite a law where collusion is a crime.  Can you?  You can't.  So a special prosecutor is supposed to be investigating a violation of the law.  So what law violation is he supposed to be investigating?  We're talking about a job specifically intended to investigate a crime being used to investigate something which isn't a crime.  This is an abuse of law enforcement power.  But what's more the investigation which apparently has Maddow flipping out is an actual criminal investigation into the DOJ and FBI abuse of law enforcement power via illegal search warrants on HUNDREDS if not thousands of people who are US citizen protected from this very action by the constitution.\n\nIf you think I have any of the facts wrong, kindly point them out.",

At this rate, this investigation could go on for years! Maybe Mueller needs more help, because the longer this investigation drags on the more excuses Trump and his \"loyal\" Republicans try to find to derail it. It's been more than a month since Mueller issued any indictments, so more are needed soon. Why? Because indictments and the fear of prison are the only thing that keeps the wild animals away from Mueller. And on Jeff Sessions, his time is coming too.

Page who Trump announced as a Foreign policy advisor & who admitted talking to Russians as an energy advisor.  Now, we discover, Russians have enough information to be able to interfere with the country's nuclear energy plants.  Admittedly I may be connecting the wrong dots but I can't imaging why an investigation into Cater Page would have so many of them so rattled.

    "Six months later, CNN confirms what was widely reported \u2014 and ignored on the left \u2014 last March 2017\n\nVladimir Putin did not hack the election. Barack Obama did.\n\nDonald Trump said earlier this year that the Obama Administration wiretapped his campaign. \u201cLike I\u2019d want to hear more from that fool?\u201d President Obama scoffed.\n\nBut CNN reported on Monday, \u201cUS investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election\u2026. The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe network labeled their story an exclusive. But, in fact, Breitbart, radio host Mark Levin, the realDonaldTrump Twitter account, and numerous other sources reported the wiretapping more than six months ago.\n\nIn the wake of the belated bombshell, other voices at CNN hung on, precariously but unabashedly, to the dated narrative.\n\nIn a story updated subsequent to CNN confirming the Obama administration\u2019s surveillance on Manafort and noting his residence in Trump Tower, CNN reporter Manu Raju continued to characterize the president\u2019s accusation affirmed by his network as Trump\u2019s \u201cunsubstantiated claim that Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped during the election to spy on him.\u201d In March, Raju\u2019s reporting consistently cast doubt on the president\u2019s wiretapping charge.\n\nCNN editor at large Chris Cillizza wrote an article, appearing the day after his network conceded the truth of the wiretap charge, entitled: \u201cDonald Trump still has no evidence that his wiretapping claim was right.\u201d In March, Cillizza wrote a piece in the Washington Post on Trump\u2019s wiretap claim under the headline: \u201cDonald Trump was a conspiracy-theory candidate. Now he\u2019s on the edge of being a conspiracy-theory president.\u201d\n\nThe media went all-in this spring on the notion that the loose-tongued Trump once again spoke without reference to the facts. Newsweek\u2019s Nina Burleigh labeled his charge \u201cincendiary.\u201d The Los Angeles Times called it \u201ca phony conspiracy theory.\u201d PolitiFact bluntly judged his accusation \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nWho will fact check the fact checkers?\n\nRather than correct the record, egged-face journalists embark upon a face-saving effort. But the media whitewash stands as neither the only nor the most relevant cover up.\n\nThe all-smoke-no-fire Russia investigation looks increasingly like a smoke screen aimed to put out a very different fire. Rather than an investigation into malfeasance by the Trump campaign, does the Robert Mueller inquiry serve as a clean-up operation to justify Obama administration malfeasance? The bugging of the opposition party\u2019s presidential campaign, at least when done by Republicans, ranks not only as criminal but as the biggest political scandal in American history.\n\nRichard Nixon\u2019s henchmen wore surgical gloves to avoid leaving clues for law enforcement. Barack Obama\u2019s henchmen were law enforcement. This makes Obama worse, not better, than Nixon. At least Nixon\u2019s plumbers possessed the decency to leave their skullduggery to lock pickers and burglars. Obama used law enforcement for opposition research. In Banana Republics, the cops double as the criminals. The unprecedented use of the Justice Department to commit injustice marks a sad moment for the republic. It is Watergate on steroids.\n\nAccusations that hit the mark, rather wild ones wide of the target, provoke fierce denunciations, outcry, and Joe Welch, have-you-no-sense-of-decency moralizing. The category-5 storm that engulfed the president after he tweeted about government surveillance on his campaign indicated that he uncovered an inconvenient truth, not that he told an ignoble lie. No one flips out when a critic makes a fool of himself with his own words. People do so when the words threaten to make a fool of them.\n\nThe Obama administration using the considerable powers of the federal government to spy on a hated critic\u2019s campaign sets a dangerous precedent. It provides future administrations a means to infiltrate the innermost circle of the opposition party\u2019s presidential campaign. This merely requires the pretext of wrongdoing to engage in wrongdoing.\n\nIt also confirms something some Republicans have long suspected: Barack Obama regards his fellow Americans as the enemy. A government conducts surveillance on foreign enemies. When one conducts surveillance on domestic critics, the government shows itself as unfit to govern.\n---American Spectator September 22, 2017, 12:05 am",

    "Samantha Power allegedly tried to \u2018unmask\u2019 Americans on a daily basis\n\nBy Chris Perez\nSeptember 20, 2017 | 10:35pm\n\nSamantha Power, who was the US Ambassador to the UN under former President Barack Obama, averaged more than one \u201cunmasking\u201d request for every working day in 2016 \u2014 even going so far as to seek the names of Trump associates just before his inauguration, a report says.\n\nSources told Fox News that Power tried to expose more than 260 people last year, most in the final days of the Obama administration.\n\nThe 46-year-old is one of several officials who worked for the former president and are now facing congressional scrutiny for their \u201cunmasking\u201d attempts.\n\nThe process is ultimately carried out when one wants to reveal the identity of an individual whose name surfaced in foreign intelligence documents.\n\nWhile a spokesperson for Power did not comment on the numerous requests, a previous statement from her lawyer, David Pressman, claimed that she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\n\n\u201cWhile serving as our Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Power was also a member of the National Security Council responsible for advising the President on the full-range of threats confronting the United States,\u201d Pressman said. \u201cAny insinuation that Ambassador Power was involved in leaking classified information is absolutely false.\u201d\n\n\nThese Obama cronies should be grilled for his intelligence 'unmaskings'\n\nWhile the former ambassador has never been mentioned by name, several lawmakers have called out an \u201cofficial\u201d in recent months, who is reportedly Power, for making hundreds of unmasking attempts during Obama\u2019s final year in office.\n\nThe individual was mentioned in a July 27 letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and during a public congressional hearing earlier this year \u2014 in which Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, questioned former CIA director John Brennan on unmasking.\n\nMany believe that Power, along with former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, misused the government process \u2014 on account of it being intended for the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cWe [the NSA] apply two criteria in response to their request: number one, you must make the request in writing. Number two, the request must be made on the basis of your official duties, not the fact that you just find this report really interesting and you\u2019re just curious,\u201d National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers explained during congressional testimony in June.\n\n\u201cIt has to tie to your job and finally, I said two but there\u2019s a third criteria, and is the basis of the request must be that you need this identity to understand the intelligence you\u2019re reading.\u201d\n\nThere have been other UN ambassadors who have made unmasking requests in the past, but Fox News reports that they typically ranged in the low double digits.\n\nPower is currently scheduled to testify before the Senate and House Intelligence committees in connection to the Russia probe. She is slated to meet with the House committee during a private meeting in October.\n\n\n\nFiled under ambassadors , barack obama , samantha power",
    "Facts say a guy politicking is a liar trying to set himself up for being able to make bigger lies. Then offering to brief a Russian to tell more promising lies? What's real funny is politicians playing upset about another politician lying to them when they both crafts lies to the public. Studies plainly show over 80% of laws made are for business contributions. No laws ever made that they have to pay fines for lies. No chance there will ever be a law they have to be quite and go to work. 99% of them would of been kicked out of the military and a high percent would be in Leavenworth for accepting money\u00a0and taking laws written by those businesses and making it the standard operating procedure of the USA.

    "I can't get this out of my mind and I hope he wouldn't be allowed to do. trump is the master of diversion although nobody should be dumb when he's trying to divert, it was Bannon who told trump to accuse President Obama of tapping his phones. trump is scared to death of what Robert Mueller is going to bring to light, he knows what he did. Would he have North Korea bombed, He's as crazy as that little fat boy in N.K.?",
    "So manafort has been a person to monitor by security forces for years... was the Trump campaign notified by any of these agencies that their chairman was a Russian stooge... why does Trump even know him... why did he drop Lewandowski for Manafort... just so strange",

    "I knew the REAL reason for the rats fleeing the WH would come to light sooner or later.  Keep digging - the truth is out there, and it's not an X-files. Ha Ha!  We don't need Agent Mulder 'cause Mr. Mueller has got this one! You are the man - keep doing your job. This is NOT Trumpamerica, this is the UNITED States OF America! I feel like Apollo Creed right now during the James Brown song in Rocky IV! In OUR country, we CHALLENGE our leaders AND their associates when they get out-of-line.",
    "I can't help but think that Robert Mueller may have seen or heard what trump said at the U.N. about North Korea, and realized that even though the investigation is going rather quickly, he needs to speed it up to try and avoid a nuclear war with North Korea. \n\nTo tell the truth, I have no idea as to why they have not already brought trump up on obstruction of justice charges. If I was the one in charge of the investigation, I would use the footage of the interview where trump said he fired James Comey just to ease the pressure from the russia trump investigation. That is a textbook case of obstruction of justice. The day after that interview, I would have told Congress that the footage of that interview is an admission of guilt in regards to obstructing an investigation. \n\nEven though the investigation is moving fairly quickly, it needs to move faster before trump gets us involved in a war with North Korea. If any of us were being investigated for committing a crime, and we had the power to, and actually did fire the person investigating us, then went on national television and said that we fired them to try and make the investigation go away, we would have been arrested the very next day. \n\nHe committed a crime. He admitted to committing a crime. There is a reason why confessions almost always stand up in court. The only reason that I can possibly think of to take this long is that they are not sure that the republicans in Congress will support trumps impeachment. That would give me even more reason to do it immediately. Mueller could start the ball rolling for the impeachment of trump, and any member of Congress, despite which party they are in, is not in favor of trumps impeachment, would be left for the voters to do away with them in the next election. If they try to impeach him immediately on obstruction of justice and fail, they have the violations of the two emoluments clauses that are in the Constitution. That is also something that trump is undeniably guilty of. It is also something that is an impeachable offense.",
    "I remember when Manafort was fired from the campaign.  I always thought it felt strange.  He was fired almost immediately after the news reported he had Russian dealings.  Trump never denied those stories and never yelled \"fake news\" or \"the press is being unfair\" to Manafort.  For sure Trump knew what Manafort was doing.  Can't wait for Trump to get nailed.",

    "You have to wonder about all the Trumpsters who keep commenting on pieces like this, \"NO EVIDENCE TRUMP COLLUDED\" (etc.) --how do they think criminal investigations work?  Do they actually think that all the bits getting leaked to the Press are ALL the evidence that Mueller has gathered?  Imagine if homicide detectives announced all their findings as they found them, to the Press; the killer would know to paint his vehicle a different color, know what details about the crime scene to pretend not to know, what witnesses had already told them, etc.  I'm with this Jill Wine-Banks, what she says at the end.

    "America, you must regulate gun ownership. You\u2019re using the 2nd amendment as an excuse.  I\u2019m from a country that allows ownership of handguns for civilians, but not long rifles (which include assault type weapons). I own a Walther PPK, but I need a license from the national police with background checking from our equivalent of your FBI.  It takes more than a month to get one.  If I want to carry this gun outside my house, I need to upgrade my license which is not easy.  If I want to own a second handgun, I must get ANOTHER license.  One gun, one license.  The licenses must be renewed YEARLY, or else you\u2019ll be penalized and the handgun confiscated.  You must have a good reason to own multiple handguns: e.g. your profession is in private security, you\u2019re a competitive sportsman in shooting etc.  This is far from perfect, as criminal elements can obtain guns by other means and corrupt politicians can bribe.  But then, the police force can focus on just these bad elements which are far fewer than the general population.  Which makes the police more effective than trying to monitor the general population and anticipate people with \u2018mental health\u2019 issues like in America.  It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s more practical and it works.  It does not infringe on freedom.  Anyway, you need a license to drive a motor vehicle, right?

    "I empathize with victims of shootings and their families, however \"empathy\" does not change the reality that determined criminals always find a way to procure firearms, either legally or illegally.  I don't know what more could have been done to prevent Nikolas Cruz from entering Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and shooting up the place.  I watched some of the footage taken by the students and it was positively horrifying to see and hear that AR-15 rifle blasting bullets, while many students got under their desks and screamed in fear.  It was very unsettling to watch these videos, but that being said, he school officials did their \"due diligence\" to discourage this shooting from occurring.  Cruz was \"banned\" from entering the high school campus, and he actually \"shot\" a school resource officer who was checking students' backpacks at the front entrance of the school.   We know that tightening our existing gun laws does not work when it comes to preventing \"determined armed criminals\" from procuring firearms.   I've seen toy cap guns converted into \"working revolvers\" and AR-15s \"made\" on 3-D printers.  The U.S. also has a \"porous border\" with Canada and Mexico.   If undocumented people can get into the U.S. without being detected, then so can illegal firearms.  Look at all of these Dreamers and DACA beneficiaries.  They come from countries where semi-auto and fully-auto weapons are rampant among the general population.

    "Mental health is one very small aspect of the problem with guns in America but the NRA supported politicians use that excuse when mass shootings like this occur because they will do anything to avoid having an honest, open adult conversation about gun control based on facts.  Assuming this is a mental health issue then why did Donald Trump in February 2017, approximately a month after becoming President REPEAL a rule Obama put into place designed to block gun sales to certain mentally ill people?  The repeal of this rule was supported by the NRA. \n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump attended and spoke to a crowd at the National Rifle Association convention in May 2016 in SUPPORT of the NRA and he has stated many times that EVERY American should carry a firearm.  Does that sound like what is in the best interest of America and is that the America we want to live in?\n\nPresident Trump signed a measure into law in February 2017 that rescinds an Obama-era rule aimed at blocking gun sales to certain mentally ill people.\n\nThe GOP-majority Senate passed the bill by a 57-43 margin earlier this month, following a House vote to overturn the rule.\n\nThe Obama administration policy \"would have required the Social Security Administration to report the records of some mentally ill beneficiaries to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System,\" as The Two-Way has reported. \"Those who have been deemed mentally incapable of managing their financial affairs \u2014 roughly 75,000 people \u2014 would have been affected by the rule.\"\n\nIt was strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association, and as NPR's Jessica Taylor reported, \"Republicans argued it infringed upon Second Amendment rights by denying due process.\"\n\nAs we have reported, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a leading supporter of the rule's repeal, has stated that \"if a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it.\"\n\nThe rule was written in response to the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot dead 20 students and six teachers. As The Associated Press reported, it was \"crafted as part of Obama's efforts to strengthen the federal background check system\" in the wake of that tragedy.\n\n\"We know that people with serious mental illness in this country can go buy a very powerful weapon and do great damage with it,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, who represents Newtown, said in a speech to Senate Republicans earlier this month. He said of mentally ill people, \"If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect you are going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm?\"",

I've asked this question from the beginning of the Trump administration: what does Trump have to do wrong to lose his base support from both GOP leaders and \"his\" American public?  I think the answer is unchanged and the same, nothing! Not long ago, Chris Hedges posted a relatively short YouTube: On the cult of Trump.  In his presentation, Mr. Hedges presents compelling reasons why Trump has a spiritual and political death-grip on certain factions of America. There can be no doubt that Donald Trump is a cult leader and a one-man wrecking-ball for America.  As is the case in all cults, by the time you realize your no better off than a \"frog in boiling water,\" it's too late. It will be up to us and future generations to share an inordinate goal to put the pieces back together, if we can find them.  At the very least, Osama Bin Laden did what Trump is unable to do, he united America, which in a perverse way, makes him a better leader than Donald Trump. \"Those that can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.\" (Questions sur les miracles; Voltare: 1765)",

Hope that you have not attracted attention from the powerful of this world, because no one will rise to save you. The President has said that the families of terrorists must be hunted down and killed, and the drones have done that. Underage children have been hunted down and blown to bits by American drones. Drones have taken out untold numbers of Yemenis. If one of us matters, all of us matter.",

Look at the recent comment by Putin's spokesman, who corroborated Cohen's emails and phone call.  It will take time, this investigation of collusion will be long over and the Southern District will continue for some time yet.

    "As a minority supporter of Senator Sanders, this election cycle has a deeper meaning to me than a email scandal when it comes to Hillary. At the very core, the discord of this election cycle is the reemergence of an old and deep rooted disease displayed by some Caucasian Americans, that being RACISM. 60-65% of Caucasian Americans supporting Hillary Clinton are racist toward blacks in particular based on questionaires that were taken recently. I respect most Caucasian Americans supporting Senator Sanders, however those of you that I see NOW in this sort of \"Bernie or Bust\" movement are no better than the racist supporters of Hillary Clinton or Donald Drumpf. That report which came out yesterday about the disturbing percentage of Hillary supporters that are purportedly racist toward blacks and minorities compared to those of Senator Sanders supporters is quite disappointing. It's rather disgusting and appalling actually, which leads one to believe over half of the Caucasian population in this country are racist. Maybe it's one of the core reasons why the rest of the WORLD is laughing at us. And laughing at minorities for accepting such a thing. Sure there are cultural differences within moderately progressive countries, but for our country to be looked upon as the ideal model of a successful melting pot of immigrants living amongst one another, is nothing more than a lie comparative to Santa Claus. While other countries admire to emulate our way of life, unbeknownst to them SOME in the majority in our country are just as phony and lie as much, as a candidate named Donald Drumpf. AKA Donald Trump!\ufeff",

Little if anything will get done and the country will suffer",

They are forcing him, to back down on his promises, to the Americans who voted for him. They want Trump, to help destroy Social Security, to appease the speaker of the house. Bill Crystal wants to run a last minute candidate against him, who doesn't have 1 electoral vote, from the people. They are threatening to fund, and support Hillary.

The closest we could agree that Korea wasn\u2019t part of China would be to say the Korea was a vassal state or a tributary state of the Chinese Empire at certain points in its past, which if you ask me means China was their rulers, in a much more real way then to say Japan and South Korea are tributary states of the US after we conquered their territories in World War 2(which is partially true).",

The Clintons and DNC were/are appalling in this regard. Perhaps in scale smaller than the Trump train, but amoral, corrupt, corrupting and dangerous to democracy nonetheless. \nI say this as occasional more general reporting on governance corruption might assist in providing a sense of \"balance\" to Ms. Maddow's reportage. Given the right's hyperpartisan blinders, perhaps not. \nMaddow was (badly) wrong in failing to hold Clinton and the DNC to account for corruption and chronic lying. That hurts her credibility in a sense because it gives a sense of bias. Her reporting is excellent otherwise, and I'm not seeking to dissuade from investigating and reportage on the trump disaster. Just to recognize that Trump won because Americans rightly recognize that our political governance is DEEPLY corrupted ON BOTH SIDES.

Cohen  (last night, 05/08/2018). Why is the special council's investigation still developing, when it logically could have been concluded well by now except for additional facts being presented on a weekly basis. Why has this president, and administration chosen to block many attempts by the special council in pursuing the facts, by conflating issues v addressing and clarifying.

    "Rachel, I love your show. I hope this explanation will find a way to you: \"China\" means different concepts to the Chinese and the Americans. American views \"China\" as a country and a modern entity established by its present government.  This concept works perfectly for the US because US has a continuous operating government according to the 1789 Constitution. When presidents change, the country doesn't.  But this concept fails what a Chinese would consider \"China.\"  The Chinese concept is based on a continuous culture and tradition, regardless of the ruler, legal system, or even political system.  Thus, Chinese are proud of their existence and cultural development for over 5000 years although many dynasties have replaced one another and different rulers have invaded, taken over, reformed, but eventually been assimilated on the same land.  When the Chinese culture led the East thousands of years ago, remote areas like Japan, Korea, Vietnam, etcl did once considered themselves an ally (in a province sense) to  the \"Central Kingdom\" (please feel free to do research to verify).  Evidence includes how the Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese languages still include many traces of the old Chinese language (the prominent trait being that Japanese continues to use thousands of Chinese characters).  Thus, even if assuming there was a statement by Chairman Xi that \"Korea was once part of China\" - that statement is not without historical merit when the heritage concept of \"China\" is used.  I provide this explanation because I am afraid communication is hindered if both sides use the same word but defines it differently.",

    "And this is how you know Maddow is a corrupt liar.  That picture with all the white stuff was not taken at the same time.  The white stuff has never been used before and the security at the event blocked off and delayed entry to the area for 4+ hours for people to get in even those who started lining up at 2am that morning... and there were people there waiting at that time to get in.  And if people understand how the Earth rotates, you will be able to SEE that the shadows on the capital building very VERY different which proves the disparity of time.  Most telling is that arch behind and to the right of the capital building as the light is actually on the OTHER SIDE of that arch in the two images.  There is no way those pictures were taken at the same time of day.  The Trump picture was CLEARLY early morning as there are barely any shadows.  And the light evidence we see shows the sun in a COMPLETELY different location in the sky.  This puts the image at least 6 hours apart at an event where the line went on for well over two miles.\n\nThe pictures which appeared later in that day look pretty much identical to the Obama inauguration.  Those pictures exist for all to see.  But lazy people will not look for these images and providing links here seem to get my comments damaged so you'll just have to search.  The truth is out there.  And given the age of the truth which has been since made available, a professional journalist would know to stop putting out fake news.  But that's what she does.  Fake news.",

She did say the news contributed to 'renewed' rage from protesters w/o supporting interviews or the like, which may be an unfortunate slip tho a minor part of the discussion.",

Too many things have happened, too many things have been said and done by her. She is the epitome of an evil woman in politics in this country who has used her office for monetary gain. Found incompetent by her peers and colleagues, lying under oath, treasonous in nature. Yet you defend her and that is pathetic. Trump has a huge ego, huge mouth, immature attitude but he is not a life long politician. He is a businessman who won the election fair and square. You have sworn to others you would make his office suffer. You Racheal Maddow are a scourge/cancer in the media today.

South Park once made a joke about how half of the world hates us and the other half just tolerates us, and in all honestly I would be amazed if even a fifth of the world's countries could still be considered our \"allies\" by the end of Trump's term. I just want to say that while I didn't vote for Donald Trump, after he won and every1 said to \"give him a chance\" I said at the time that I will wait till the end of the first 100 days/the honeymoon period before judging his job as President. As of now, it seems that his strategy to \"make America great again\" is to make us an isolationist nation that doesn't need any1 else to be economically strong. Now, I do know that we do have trade deals that hurt American workers, but we need to trade with some countries for resources that we don't have. Our military is also the most powerful, but if we enter another war (which is becoming more possible) we need our military allies to help us win. And tourism from other countries to the U.S. provides millions of dollars to the economy every year, but I saw an article online that said since the inauguration, tourism from almost every country (on a list of over 80) has dropped with the exception of Russia. While I still want to travel after I graduate and really get the opportunity to live my life before settling into a full time job and family, I do worry that by the time I can America won't be as economically strong and many of our allies will have more resentment towards us traveling there.",
    "Even though this is an issue practically no American politician has talked about, I honestly believe a spike in Venezuelan immigration or refugees may become a political talking point prior to the next Presidential election.

Every place on the planet has parts that are shitholes. Trump was talking about the people because the conversation was about immigrants from those countries and El Salvador.. He then went on to say that we should obtain immigrants from Norway, a white country.\nAfricans are actually the highest % in this country with graduate degrees.. 11% white, 43% African so obviously they can't be that bad if the people are that intelligent.. They also pay for their degrees themselves..

Trump's appendages.  Suppose it had just been Trump, Bush, Kasich and Cruz or Rubio, with the rest told by the RNC right from the beginning to stop hallucinating and support one of those four who were more likely to win.  No, that's not democratic, but then the whole process was not democratic in the sense of the majority of voters getting their choice:  Trump won only 45% of the GOP primary/caucus vote and 46% of the vote in the general election.  (And people criticize Hillary for \"fixing\" the nominating process when she won 55% of the Democratic popular vote to 43% for Bernie.)  Republicans apparently still think they can put all the evils back into Pandora's box after opening it, and they might have done so, had Donald Trump lost, and just remained an unsuccessful, big-mouthed real estate mogul and successful big-mouthed TV host and self-promoter.  Now, at least some of them seem to realize they could get swallowed up in a tsunami of Trumpism just like African-Americans, Democrats, immigrants and whoever else doesn't pass the extreme right's litmus tests could.  In July of 1932, the Nazis won but 37% of the vote in the Reichstag elections, but became the biggest party in the body because the opposition was weak and divided.  Six months later, the Reichstag was in ruins, as the fanatics burned down the building of the democratically elected parliament, Hitler was installed as chancellor and emergency laws started to be promulgated by the Nazis without anyone else's acquiescence.

On the Passaic City Council, Jackson voted against two resolutions relating to insurance brokerage contracts, which the U.S. Attorney's Office said \"had the effect of favoring the undercover company.\" Jackson also admitted accepting corrupt payments in exchange for arranging meetings with other public officials to obtain insurance business for the undercover company.

They live off the suffering that low value products produce. The idea that someone who made their investment money by running 12 hamburger stands, is now retired and living off their Walmart stock portfolio, should be repulsive, but its the norm.

    "u.s politicians know that information is power, Donald Trump do not know that. \ncomrade Donald Trump know or should have known that Michael Flynn was a Russia traitor like the president, president Donald Trump is the mole in the white house .president Obama knew about and i will not be surprise if this was a set up by the Obama administration.",
    "Hillary received money from Saudi-arabia, leaked classified documents from a server in her basement, got american soldiers and diplomats killed in Benghazi, lied about everything. All this proven facts. None of the things Trump is accused of has been proven. What is this twilight zone I'm living in?",
    "\"May have committed\". So, we don't know yet? Msnbc and CNN are so quick to jump on these types of stories before they even get full details. That's why they're the legends of fake news. Just.. calm down lol. You get the libs hopes up for nothing 99.9% of the time.",

I guess it's true what they say \n(Sanity is determined by a majority rules mentality )",
    "I truly believe that Trump has delusions of grandeur (he probably plays with himself in front of the mirror, hence the robe).  But worse, he truly seems to be in denial of any truths not beholden to him. He tells lies he knows will be challenged and just deflects when they are; insults anybody at anytime; and truly believes that all of these behaviors are excusable because   he is so much wiser than anyone. He actually said \" I understand more than anyone\".\n I think congress should start to invoke the 25th amendment ordering that he be examined by a psychiatrist for mental defect. It may take a while, but he would either leave office before being humiliated, or he would be proven unfit  and be forced out !",
    "If they actually listened to him. He wants to have Russia help with ISIS but also to help put pressure on China and there unfair tactics. He's said that constantly. Guess they don't listen.",
    "WE DEMAND A 9/11-STYLE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE RUSSIAN HACKS AND THE INTERFERENCE IN OUR DEMOCRACY! \n \n \u201cRussia interfered\u201d in our Election according to 17 Government Agencies (Grizzly Steppe) \n\nIn a joint interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Jan. 7, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) described the stakes: \u201cWhat Putin did poses a threat to the very fundamentals of our democracy\u2026\u201d\n\nSen. Graham emphasized that this is not a partisan issue: \u201cWe should get to the bottom of all things Russia when it came to the 2016 election, period. Wherever it leads in whatever form\u2026\u201d\n\nTrump and Russia:\n\nPutin engaged successfully in a sophisticated cyberattack on a cherished American right \u2014 voting. Among other methods, Russia used WikiLeaks to distribute emails that it had hacked from the Democratic National Committee. The public record is incomplete, but the relatively few known facts paint a disturbing big picture. \n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to develop business in Russia date to 1987. In 1996, he applied for his trademark in that country. Discussing ambitions for a Trump hotel in 2007, he declared, \u201cWe will be in Moscow at some point.\u201d\n\nOct. 15, 2007, Trump said: \u201cLook at Putin \u2014 what he\u2019s doing with Russia \u2014 I mean, you know, what\u2019s going on over there. I mean this guy has done \u2014 whether you like him or don\u2019t like him \u2014 he\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d\n\n2008, Donald Trump Jr. said: \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets\u2026 we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\u201d\n\nJune 18, 2013, Trump tweeted: \u201cDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow \u2014 if so, will he become my new best friend?\u201d While at the pageant, Trump said, \u201cI have plans for the establishment of business in Russia. Now, I am in talks with several Russian companies to establish this skyscraper.\u201d\n\nNov. 11, 2013, Trump tweeted: \u201cTRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next.\u201d\n\nNovember 2013, Trump said: \u201c[Putin\u2019s] done a very brilliant job in terms of what he represents and who he\u2019s represented.\u201d\n\nMarch 6, 2014, Trump said: \u201cYou know, I was in Moscow a couple of months ago. I own the Miss Universe Pageant and they treated me so great. Putin even sent me a present, a beautiful present.\u201d\n\nNov. 10, 2015, Trump said: \u201cI got to know [Putin] very well because we were both on 60 Minutes. We were stablemates, and we did very well that night.\u201d\n\nDec. 10, 2015: Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who would become Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser, sat at Putin\u2019s table for the 10th anniversary gala of Russia\u2019s state-owned television propaganda network, RT. Flynn had made a paid appearance on the network.\n\nFeb. 17, 2016: As questions about Russia swirl around Trump, he changed his story: \u201cI have no relationship with [Putin], other than he called me a genius.\u201d\n\nApril 20, 2016: Paul Manafort became Trump\u2019s campaign manager. Reports surfaced about his 2007-12 ties to Ukraine\u2019s pro-Putin former president, whom Manafort had helped to elect.\n\nJuly 18, 2016: The Washington Post reports the Trump campaign worked behind the scenes on a Republican convention platform plank. It gutted the GOP\u2019s longstanding support for Ukrainians\u2019 popular resistance to Russia\u2019s 2014 intervention.\n\nJuly 27, 2016, Trump said: \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d\n\nAnd at the same press conference, he insisted: \u201cI never met Putin. I\u2019ve never spoken to him.\u201d\n\nJuly 31, 2016: Manafort denied knowing anything about the change in the Republican platform. That afternoon, Boris Epshteyn, Trump\u2019s Russian-born adviser, spouted the Kremlin\u2019s party line, telling CNN: \u201cRussia did not seize Crimea. We can talk about the conflict that happened between Ukraine and the Crimea\u2026But there was no seizure by Russia. That\u2019s an incorrect statement, characterization, of what happened.\u201d\n\nAug. 6, 2016: NPR confirmed the Trump campaign\u2019s involvement in the Republican platform change on Ukraine.\n\nAug. 19, 2016: As reports of Manafort\u2019s financial connections to Ukraine intensified, he resigned from the Trump campaign.\n\nOct. 1, 2016: Six days before Wikileaks released its first batch of DNC emails that the Russians had hacked, Trump\u2019s informal adviser and surrogate, Roger Stone, tweeted: Hillary is done, WikiLeaks\n\nOct. 4, 2016: Trump tweeted: \u201cCLINTON\u2019S CLOSE TIES TO PUTIN DESERVE SCRUTINY.\u201d\n\nOct. 12, 2016: Roger Stone told NBC News, \u201cI have back-channel communications with WikiLeaks.\u201d\n\nNov. 9, 2016: After Putin announced Trump\u2019s election victory, Russia\u2019s Parliament erupted in applause.\n\nNov. 10, 2016: Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister admitted that during the campaign, the Kremlin had continuing communications with Trump\u2019s \u201cimmediate entourage.\u201d\n\nJan. 11, 2017: the final question of Trump\u2019s first news conference came from Ann Compton of ABC News:\u201cMr. President-elect, can you stand here today, once and for all, and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign?\u201d Trump paused, then reverted to a standard Trump strategy: deflecting, diverting and distracting. He never answered her. Away from cameras and heading toward the elevators, Trump reportedly said, \u201cNo,\u201d his team didn\u2019t have contact with Russia.\n\nFeb. 5, 2017 - O\u2019Relly Factor: \u201cHe\u2019s a killer, though \u2014 Putin\u2019s a killer.\u201d Trump\u2019s response: \u201cLotta killers. We got a lotta killers. What, you think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d \u201cTake a look at what we\u2019ve done \u2014 made a lotta mistakes.\u201d \n\nOther characters lurk in the background. After the election, Carter Page \u2014 an early foreign policy adviser to Trump \u2014 was in Moscow to \u201cmeet with business and thought leaders.\u201d Rick Gates was involved with Paul Manafort in Ukraine and a deputy on the Trump campaign. \n\nFind All Dots and Connect Them:\n\nThe known data points cluster to create a clear impression: Putin helped Trump win and Trump welcomed the assistance. Why?\n\nTrump\u2019s admiration enhances Putin\u2019s status on the world stage. If he can get Trump to lift economic sanctions imposed after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, so much the better. Those sanctions are crippling Russia\u2019s economy. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s persistent questioning of US intelligence findings undermines those agencies\u2019 credibility while emboldening Putin to continue flexing his cyber-muscles in European countries\u2019 democratic elections.\n\nWhat does Trump get in return? The presidency and who knows what else. His refusal to release comprehensive information about his business connections to Russia \u2014 or anywhere \u2014 leads to ugly inferences. Trump should want to dispel them, unless he can\u2019t because they\u2019re correct. Whatever Putin knows \u2014 and he may know a lot \u2014 might give him enormous leverage over the president. \n\nThe Times of London on Jan. 15, 2017: \u201cWe should trust Putin.\u201d\n\nExpressing once again his skepticism about NATO, Trump lambasted German Chancellor Angela Merkel. That would have pleased Putin. The Western alliance contributed mightily to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which he called the \u201cgreatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.\u201d Putin seeks to destabilize the West and restore Russia\u2019s lost sphere of influence.\n\nCongress must authorize a special independent 9/11-type commission. \n\n\u201cRussia interfered\u201d.  WE NEED A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR!  Jeff Sessions should step aside in the Investigation.  He was part of Trump\u2019s Campaign.  \n\nSUBPOENA HIS ASSOCIATES &  TRUMP\u2019S TAXES - FOLLOW THE PAPERWORK AND ESPECIALLY, THE MONEY!\n\nNO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW \u2013 NOT EVEN THE ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT!",
    "Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. made that very claim at a real estate conference in New York in 2008, saying \u201cRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\u201d Donald Trump Jr. added, \u201cwe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\u201d",

Also, FBI director Comey should be fired and/or also go to prison.",

A world that wants to change everythign about the cult memebsr lives and wants to basicly anhialate their way of life. And thats why cult members become violent either outwardly or inwardly when the true absolute reality becomes so obviously overwhelming to the point they can no longer have the cognative disidence that they depend on.\nBut the fact is..this is a cult...and like cult memebers unless you do radical deprogramming...they will NEVER change. so we shouldnt bother. stop pointing out that cult memebsr are in a cult..they do not care.\nThe only thing you can do for a cult is try to prevent it from spreading. Focus on the wrongs they are doing in the cult and turn public opinion against them to the point they become impotent and powerless. And the way to do that is not to point out hey this is a cult. its to point out OH my god..they are doing \"this this this\" and its going to effect society at large.

This was confirmed by both South Korea and China. Lacking the insurance of nuclear weapons, Kim Jong needs to buy time to reinstate his facilities again and to feed his people.

Some of them might imagine themselves ready to push back if things get worse.  What they don't realize is that by then it will be too late.  Last, and most importantly, the people aren't keeping Trump in check.  His popularity continues to grow, and the outrage continues to decrease.  At this rate, I expect Republicans to hold the House and Senate.  After that, all bets are off.  Few will dare question him, and he will sail to victory in 2020.  That might be our last real election.  After that, Congress will be eager to give Trump dictatorial powers.",

    "You reap what you sow!  Donald Trump, the current White House administration, the Republican Congress and the Pro Trump supporters continue to sow the seeds of divisiveness and hate and then are upset when they reap what they have sown!\n\nDonald Trump has attacked the media, members of the Hollywood elite, Judges, the Judiciary, disabled people, average people like the Khan family and many more people who didn\u2019t deserve to be treated the way the President has treated them.  Ever since Donald Trump announced he would run for President his attacks against anyone he doesn\u2019t perceive as Pro Trump have been very personal and vicious and I have not heard a single Trump supporter speak up and say that what Donald Trump is doing is wrong or inappropriate.  In fact, the Trump supporters love it when Donald Trump attacks the media and at times they have even joined in with some bashing of their own.  \n\nDonald Trump has created the divisiveness that exists in this Country and rarely a day goes by without Donald Trump attacking the media, the Democratic members of Congress and anyone else he feels he can demean, belittle and make to appear less than they are in an effort to massage his ego and attempt to make himself look like a big man.  What Donald Trump fails to recognize is that it doesn\u2019t make him look like a big man, it actually makes him look like the small, petty, egotistical man-child that he truly behaves like!\n\nDonald Trump, the White House administration and the current Republican party reminds me of school yard bullies who have met their match in that they find themselves up against someone who can dish out the same treatment they have been dishing out, only better, and the bullies and their friends cry about the bullies being bullied.  SO SAD! \n\nI have watched Sarah Huckabee Sanders treat reporters with rudeness and complete disrespect whenever they ask a legitimate question that she doesn\u2019t want to answer because she knows the truthful answer would make Donald Trump look bad.  That is unacceptable behavior, and because of her unacceptable behavior she does not deserve anyone\u2019s respect.  She has placed herself in the crosshairs of the world and is fair game for anyone who sees her as a liar willing to defend another liar!\n\nDonald Trump is a bully who loves to attack people in the media and if he and his supporters can't take it when someone bullies them back maybe they should consider changing their own behavior by trying to get along with others.  These people could make an effort at being nice for a change and stop attacking, ridiculing, bullying and demeaning anyone and everyone who has a differing political viewpoint.  \n\nDonald Trump says that the fake news liberals hate him.  Donald Trump I don't hate you, I just don't trust or respect you!\n\nDonald Trump and the entire White House administration needs to take the first step to end this war of divisiveness and hate by demonstrating respect and compassion for others along with a modicum of professionalism!\n\nIf you want respect, give respect!",

Mueller is investigating criminal activities by Russia in stealing Democratic emails and using them to support Trump.  Behind that decision is the motivation for wanting to do that, which raises Trump's financial ties to them which, when looked into, will probably reveal he's a RICO style Mafia type and they'll probably get a lot of info on that, which is why Trump then obstructed justice by firing Comey.  On top of that some of these players have also filed false statements and lied to the FBI.

More hypocrisy as republicans stumble over themselves trying to justify actions that they railed against for 8yrs.  I mean really, are there any \"principles\" that conservatives won't drop the minute it suits them.  When I was growing up America stood for something.  We didn't invade other countries unprovoked.  We didn't condone torture.  I even remember when republicans believed that the moral character of a man mattered.  I personally believe blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is the attributing to God the works of the devil.  When they try to convince us that Trump is God's doing they are blaspheming the Holy Spirit which according to Jesus is unforgivable. Also, Trump mocked Jesus and his death on the cross when he said that he didn't need forgiveness because he didn't make mistakes.   Far be it from me to question the validity of someones faith like conservatives did to Obama but how can you be a Christian without repentance and forgiveness?  Isn't that the whole point?

One of those people has already been sentenced and served a month in prison, while four others pleaded guilty and await sentencing.\n2.  The Justice Department says the hacking targeted Clinton's campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, with the intention to \"release that information on the internet under the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 and through another entity.\"\n3. Russian GRU officers hacked the website of a state election board and stole information about 500,000 voters.\n4. They also hacked into computers of a company that supplied software used to verify voter registration information.\n5. The defendants worked for two units of the GRU that \"engaged in active cyber operations to interfere in the 2016 presidential elections,\" Rosenstein said. One unit stole information using spearfishing schemes and hacked into computer networks where they \"installed malicious software that allowed them to spy on users and capture keystrokes, take screenshots and exfiltrate or remove data from those computers.\"\n\nEvidence, and there's lots more to come.  Lets guess Trump's response shall we ... drum roll ... \"fake news\" as he goes and has his private meeting with Putin.

The latest to add to that list is SC congressman Trey Gowdy, which might answer the question about why he announced his imminent retirement early this year. With the inclusion of Gowdy, that means leadership in BOTH Houses of Congress are now known to have some tie-in to what Mueller's investigating. Gowdy is the sixth GOP lawmaker to be tied to Cambridge Analytica, but the first of those not in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAlso, while it's not being widely reported, watch Florida. Florida's Governor, Rick Scott, who had earlier made a deal in 2015 with the Russian Weapons Company, resulting in Kalashnikov USA being built in Pompano Beach, something that ultimately led to the NRA' s brass going to Moscow near the end of the year, has now been tied to deals with numerous other sanctioned Russian entities in a recent POLITICO article. It's a federal crime to do business with any foreign entity that's been sanctioned by the government, and Scott's already under investigation by the U.S. Attorney in Miami for that 2015 deal with the RWC. Those other deals with sanctioned Russian entities could result in Rick Scott having to answer to Bob Mueller and his team of prosecutors.",

Vox Media was founded by penny stock fraudster Jerome Armstrong.who wrote favorable stories about dubious penny stocks and not disclosing he was paid to do so. Jerome Armstrong appears to have moved forward with the penny stock touting idea founding Vox Media had spread daily stories about Hillary without disclosing that they are paid to do so. \n\nHere is Vox Media BIG PILE OF CRAP. Vox Media was funded by hedge funds such as Accel Partner that was involved and made a fortune in the Uranium company featured in the Clinton Cash movie http://americans4innovation.blogspot.com/2016/01/clinton-2005-uranium-junket-netted-152.html that supported crooked Hillary. NBC Universal has also kicked in 200 million dollars https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Media \n\nAnd now a interesting story about the founder of Vox Media: \n\nSTOCK SHOCK IN PAST OF DEM HOPEFUL\u2019S AIDE \n\nBy Deborah Orin June 29, 2006 | 4:00am IMAGINE the outrage, especially from the Left, if President Bush were to hire an Internet guru who had a past as a Web shill for a worthless dot-com stock. Nope, Bush hasn\u2019t \u2013 but \u201cun-Hillary\u201d 2008 Democratic prospect Mark Warner did just that when he hired Jerome Armstrong and has no plans to fire him, despite new revelations about his past. ADVERTISING The Post\u2019s Roddy Boyd recently reported that after a Securities and Exchange Commission probe, Armstrong agreed to a December 2003 SEC settlement that permanently bans him from stock-touting. Armstrong also signed a court agreement with the SEC that he can\u2019t deny \u2013 or let anyone else deny \u2013 \u201cany allegation in the complaint\u201d that accused him of touting worthless stock for pay. But Warner spokeswoman Ellen Qualls said he\u2019s keeping his $5,000- a-month job: \u201cThis is a private matter between Jerome and the SEC relating to activities years ago.\u201d She declined to say if Warner disclosed Armstrong\u2019s SEC woes or if Armstrong, 42, meets the ethical standards required for, say, a White House job, saying Warner isn\u2019t now a candidate. Dems are madly wooing left-wing bloggers \u2013 Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton just hired one and Warner spent $50,000 to dish up sushi and a chocolate fountain for 1,000 at the Yearly Kos blogger convention. Some Dems suspect Warner fears ditching Armstrong would spark rage from his ex-business partner, Markos Moulitsas-Zuniga of the Daily Kos Web site, who\u2019s had nice things to say about Warner so far. Armstrong and Kos are often touted as Internet wunderkinds in the 2004 Howard Dean campaign \u2013 but Dean campaign manager Joe Trippi and top aide Kate O\u2019Connor say it ain\u2019t so. Trippi said Armstrong\u2019s role was \u201cmostly to help placing our blog ads for $3,000 a month\u201d and \u201cMarkos had almost nothing to do with the campaign.\u201d Both Trippi and O\u2019Connor \u2013 while often at odds in the Dean campaign \u2013 agreed that contrary to the Kos myth, Dean\u2019s real Internet stars were Nicco Malley, Mat Gross and Zephyr Teachout. Trippi also said that Armstrong never disclosed his SEC woes when he was hired in June 2003 \u2013 when the SEC probe was well under way, saying: \u201cIt was never disclosed to me.\u201d Several Dem activists were startled that Warner would risk his own image to keep Armstrong. \u201cAnyone can hire someone who turns out to be a bad seed or problem. The question is what you do about it and what that shows about your own standards as a leader,\u201d said a veteran Dem fund-raiser who had been considering Warner for 2008.",

    "The House of Torlonia are the top bankers on the planet and are the Vatican's treasurers. The Torlonia family are overseeing the United States Treasury through Rome's network of power and also oversee private Swiss bank accounts of the Italian nobility. The French word \"Tor\" means tower and the Torlonia family have French ancestry. Lonia is like loan. The Torlonia name represents loan tower. The family is overseeing the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland which is designed as a tower and is stealing wealth from the central banks around the world through fraudulent tax contracts. The BIS is also financing criminals with pay offs disguised as investments and loans. The Vatican and Swiss Cantons have been in contract for centuries and this is why the Swiss Guard protects the Vatican City State today. The Geneva flag uses a key symbol similar to the papal keys on its coat of arms along with the Jesuit logo. The UBS Bank which was partly created by the Warburg family also uses these keys for its logo. M.M. Warburg & Company has operations in Switzerland. Switzerland and Vatican City are the only two nations on the planet that use the square shaped flag. Switzerland is like a Papal State. The Torlonia family hold titles of Princes of Fucino and they are the founders and owners of Banca Fucino with Prince Giulio Torlonia as a board member and the recently deceased Prince Allesandro Torlonia as the former president of the bank. One of the Fucino Bank branches operates out of the Palazzo Borghese. The Torlonia family which are the Princes of Civitella-Cesi are the covert owners of the Civella crime family of Kansas City and co-owners of the LaRocca crime family of Pittsburg along with the Borghese and Rocco di Torrepadula families. The La Torre Camorra mafia clan of Mondragone is operating in the UK and is owned by the Borghese and Torlonia families. Johnny Torrio was a mafia agent of the Torlonia family and took over the Chicago Mob for a period of time. Johnny Torrio created the Big Seven a name of an old mafia alliance. The Torlonia family have a seven pointed star on their coat of arms. The Torlonia family are married with the Spanish House of Bourbon and have part ownership of the Juarez Cartel which have a network with the Civella crime family and are covertly operating in Texas. Prince Marino Torlonia's grandfather was King Alfonso XIII of Spain.\n\nThe House of Torlonia of Fucino intermarried with the Borghese banking family of Rome. Princess Marcella Borghese who died in 2002 lived in Switzerland and was in business with Revlon which produced her Borghese line of cosmetics. The Borghese family have established a branch in the United States with Don Giovanni Borghese, Don Ferdinando Borghese, and Allegra Borghese and they own the Castello di Borghese Vineyards in Long Island. Prince Francesco Borghese and his son Prince Lorenzo Borghese who was on the show the Bachelor also have a residence in the United States. Prince Lorenzo Borghese acts as their public relations. Duke Leopold Torlonia is a Knight of Malta. Pope Paul V or Camillo Borghese founded the Bank of the Holy Spirit in 1605 and it more recently merged with Banca di Roma which merged with Capitalia and then merged with Unicredit and went into contract with Santander, Warburg Pincus, and General Atlantic. These contracts ended in July 2016 right after it was exposed. Unicredit is a popular bank in Europe and its headquarters is located in Rome. The House of Torlonia is also intermarried with the Javal banking family of France and the royal family of Luxembourg which are heavily involved in banking. The Torlonia family were a branch of the Conti di Siegni family of Italy that moved to France and intermarried with French Alsacien bankers before returning to Italy as the House of Torlonia. The Conti family had a family branch in Venice where the Warburg or Del Banco family originated just as their Unicredit proxy was in contract with Warburg Pincus. Max Warburg is a top banker in Germany today and works as Managing Director of M.M. Warburg & Company. The Torlonia family have deep connections with French bankers and recently married into the royal family of Luxembourg. Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg's wife is Princess Sibilla Torlonia and Prince Guillaume has also worked for the International Monetary Fund. Luxembourg's former Minister of Finance Luc Frieden was Chairman for the Board of Governors of the IMF and World Bank Group. Banking in Luxembourg is private just like in Switzerland. The ancient House of Luxembourg were the Kings of Bohemia. The Torlonia family are the Princes of Civitella-Cesi. Civetta is the Italian word for owl. Top Conservative politicians have a yearly gathering at Bohemian Grove in California where they make mock human sacrifices to a giant owl.\n\nThe name Borghese or Bourgeoisie refers to a walled city and the people of these cities were usually bankers and merchants rather than farmers. The House of Borghese have a dragon on their coat of arms and they live in Rome and had dozens of fiefdoms in the Papal States. They are patricians of Venice as well. The Torlonia-Borghese family of Fucino married with the Del Drago family and their name means \"of the dragon.\" The Del Drago family are a Black Nobility of Viterbo. Anna Del Drago married Prince Alessandro Torlonia of Fucino and his grandfather was a Borghese. Marquis Ferdinando Filippo Del Drago is the current head of this family along with Prince Filippo del Drago-Marescotti and Princess Alessandra del Drago-Marescotti. Drago is similar to the name Draghi. Mario Draghi was born in Rome, was Jesuit educated from the Massimo Institute, and he is one of the most powerful bankers in society as President of the European Central Bank. Mario Draghi is also on the board of directors for the BIS and a member of the Group of Thirty. Mario Draghi, Fabio Panetta, and Ignazio Visco are all from Italy and all directly tied to Rome and board directors for the Bank for International Settlements. Benito Mussolini rented the Torlonia Villa in Rome from the Torlonia family. Prince Junio Valerio Borghese was a naval commander under Mussolini. These banking families are financing and directing fascist secret societies in the United States. The Torlonia family also hold the continual position of Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne at the Vatican City. The Borghese family have part ownership of the Philly Mob and share ownership of the Pittsburg crime family with the Torlonia family. The Borghese are princes in Sicily through a marriage with the Paterno-Manganelli family. Today the Borghese family own the Palazzo Manganelli in Sperlinga, Sicily. The Borghese family are also part owners of the Magliana Mafia in Rome. Members of the Torlonia crime family include Prince Giovanni Torlonia the VII Prince of Civitella-Cesi, Prince Marino Torlonia, Prince Giulio Torlonia, Duke Leopoldo Torlonia, Prince Guido Torlonia, Princess Ines Theodoli-Torlonia, Count Alessandro Lequio-Torlonia, Count Alex Lequio-Torlonia and of the Borghese crime family is Prince Francesco Borghese, Prince Lorenzo Borghese, Prince Scipione Borghese, Princess Alessandra Borghese, Don Fabio Borghese, Don Giovanni Borghese, Don Ferdinando Borghese, and Allegra Borghese.\n\nhttp://it.fashionnetwork.com/news/Il-principe-Torlonia-lancia-i-suoi-profumi,899798.html#.WlHDnXtFy1s\n\nPrince Giovanni Torlonia \n\nhttp://www.elmundo.es/loc/2014/12/10/54872760268e3e8b278b456f.html\n\nAlessandro Lecquio-Torlonia with the deceased Marco Torlonia\n\nhttp://www.dagospia.com/mediagallery/dago_gallery-14034/260585.htm\n\nGiudo Torlonia\n\nhttps://www.ilcattolico.it/catechesi/catechesi-del-santo-padre/udienza-di-benedetto-xvi-ai-soci-del-circolo-san-pietro-26-giugno-2010.html\n\nDuke Leopoldo Torlonia\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Prince_of_sulmona_scipione_borghese.PNG\n\nScipione Borghese\n\nhttps://northforker.com/2017/01/27/new-leader-castello-di-borghese/\n\nDon Giovanni Borghese\n\nhttp://marcellinonews.blogspot.com/2012/07/giovanni-torlonia-con-filippo-del-drago.html\n\nGiovanni Torlonia and Filippo Del Drago",

Manafort and Gates were deep with New York and Russian mob bosses. Trump HAD to make deals in NYC, Atlantic City and Chicago to build and to do business. Trump is who he is because of the Mob. I think what's going to shock people is there will be talks of Trump giving orders to have people murdered. If Trump could get away with that now there would be several mysterious murders all over this country. There was one and that was the mysterious death of a DNC staffer in 2016.",

He won't divest his businesses, but lets his kids in on government business. He's tweeting lies (3 million illegal voters.

    "\"High cost of Obamacare\" is a Republican lie.  High cost increases have hit only a very small fraction of the insured.  90+% of the insured have seen price increases of 2% or less annually since its implementation in 2013.  The cost of health care was increasing 15% annually for the 13 years prior to Obamacare's implementation.  From 15% for 13 years to 2% for the last 3 years.  Hmmm.

If this was from Bush or Trump, every Dem would be blaming them instead of making excuses that its the other people.

Matti Peled went from being the Major General, the second highest rank in the Israeli military to the first Israeli Professor of Arabic Literature at Tel Aviv University and a founding member of the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace. Matti Peled served a four year term in Israel\u2019s Knesset Parliament.\n\u00a0What Matti Peled feared was an occupation of Palestinian lands that would eventually lead to a grassroots rebellion against the Israeli presence. Miko notes his father carried with him on his speeches a rubber bullet used by the Israeli military to suppress an uprising. The thin rubber coating on top disguised the steel within. Matti Peled evolved from speaking on behalf of the Israeli\u2019s established views to that of a man who advocated peace. He firmly believed Israel was much better off making peace than arming itself and maintaining an occupation of land conquered in 1967. Matti Peled recommended the US stop selling Israel its weapons and giving it free money.\u00a0 Matti Peled argued the weapons sold to Israel were corrupting the country and being used to maintain an oppression of the Palestinians, which Matti Peled firmly believed was morally wrong and illegal. Matti Peled did not accept the double standard that Jewish people deserve to live on the same lands as Palestinians while depriving them of their rights and argued it would destroy the moral fiber of Israel.",

    "It is increasingly obvious (at least via certain social media discussion) that there are irreconcilable differences between fullthroated Democratic Party loyalists and faithless Democratic Party voters on a litany of policy postions as well as the regard of elected officials. One side has a notion that the other should effectively \"fall in-line\" and \"stop being naive purists\".  The other believes that the party effectively acts like its \"too big to fail\" and that the party \"needs to wholeheartedly represent the people and not be corrupt\". In the court of law, irreconcilable differences are grounds for a divorce and I believe that is what the current division within the party merits. IMHO I feel that  an effective way to do this is to take advantage of the unpopularity of DJT and the likely, yet not permanent, overthrow of the GOP in state legislatures, governors' mansions, Congress and the Oval Office between 2018 and 2020. Before power is likely obtained in these branches of government, a clear, executable plan needs to be agreed upon by all candidates and elected Dems in order to enact the divorce process. \n\nThis can be done via Comprehensive Election Reform. This will include but may not be limited to anti-gerrymandering laws, anti voter suppression laws, voter empowerment actions (expanding election day, no excuse absentee/early voting, same day registration, mandatory-ish voting), open/hybrid state run primaries, campaign finance reform (public finance of elections, \"get money out of politics\") and electoral college review & reform. However most important to the divorce process, federal and state ranked choice voting need to be implemented. This will nullify the \"spoiler effect\" lamented by many of those against third-party voting. Furthermore, the Commission on Presidential Debates and other debate/town hall/forum regulating bodies must immediately allow at least Green Party and Libertarian Party candidates on the debate stage. Also, rules must be put into place that make getting onto the debate stage and ballot easier for all hard-working candidates. \n\nIn order to receive the immediate party unity that apparently held in such high esteem, it is strongly encouraged that all candidates and elected Dems agree to this Comprehensive Election Reform Pact. Failure to agree could result in consequences (for Dem party) similar to the elections between 2010 and 2016 on all levels of government. Since nothing in this reform is abhorrently objectionable in nature, it should behoove wholesale, fullthroated agreement. Once in power (respectively for each level of government), this Comprehensive Election Reform agenda must be signed into law and executed upon within the first 100 days in power for that branch of government.\n\nyrdf",

Russia has used him to launder money, via LLC's to purchase Trump properties, etc.  Now that they got him elected in 2016, via nefarious means, most likely financed directed by Putin, Putin now wants Trump to \"LIFT\" the onerous sanctions currently in place.  This would allow Putin to make billions in extracting oil reserves in Siberia, etc.  Lifting sanctions against his cabal of oligarchs would also help them financially.  Trump is colluding w/Russia against the U.S. This is painfully clear.  Our Democracy is in danger of being severely damaged if Republicans fail to act to put a stop to Trump's continued, destruction of our country.  Open you ear and eyes, see what he actually going on.",
    "WOW this is so true Russia has something on him.  He idolizes Putin.  Look how he looks at Putin.  He says he is powerful.  He fears Putin and totally threw the USA under the bus.",

The first president to ever do that. 45's not only the most embarrassing president EVER, our fake president is so compromised, it's very dangerous to national security! \n\n45 is as phony as a 3 dollar bill and as crooked as a corkscrew.

    "The Political Retribution is here. Enjoy it->FEC complaint alleges Clinton campaign, DNC violated campaign law by funding 'Trump dossier'\n\nby Mandy Mayfield | Oct 25, 2017, 6:37 PM\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign committee violated campaign finance laws after they failed to disclose payments linked to the so-called \"Trump dossier,\" alleged a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission by the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nThe complaint obtained by the Washington Examiner comes one day after the Washington Post reported that Marc Elias, a lawyer who represented both the Clinton campaign and the DNC, funded Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm responsible for the dossier, which possesses a great deal of unverified information tying President Trump to Russia.\n\n\"By filing misleading reports, the DNC and Clinton campaign undermined the vital public information role of campaign disclosures,\" Adav Noti, senior director of trial litigation and strategy at Campaign Legal Center, said in a press release. \"Voters need campaign disclosure laws to be enforced so they can hold candidates accountable for how they raise and spend money. The FEC must investigate this apparent violation and take appropriate action.\"\n\nClinton's campaign reportedly routed 37 payments to Fusion GPS through the law firm Perkins Coie, totaling over $5.5 million, and reported each as \"legal services.\" The DNC reported 345 payments to Perkins Coie during the election cycle and marked the payments as \"legal and compliance consulting, administrative fees, and data services subscription\" among others, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Payments by a campaign or party committee to an opposition research firm are legal, as long as those payments are accurately disclosed,\" Brendan Fischer, director of federal and FEC reform at Campaign Legal Center, said. \"But describing payments for opposition research as \u2018legal services' is entirely misleading and subverts the reporting requirements.\"\n\nAccording to Lawnewz, the DNC and the Clinton campaign could face fines.\n\nThe DNC put out a statement Tuesday to say that its \"new leadership\" had nothing to do with funding the dossier, but made no mention of its leadership during the 2016 campaign.\n\nMandy Mayfield DNC Elections Donald Trump FEC Campaigns 2016 Elections Campaign Finance Russia Hillary Clinton Washington Post Democratic Party White House News Politics",
    "I\u2019m surprised to hear the new discrediting spin on the dossier - \u201cNobody from ANY foreign government should influence our election\u201d. Agreed. Unlike the trump campaign and Wikileaks, Facebook, Twitter etc., nobody from the Clinton campaign did such. If people will remember, we NEVER heard a word from the Clinton campaign about this dossier until Long after Election Day.

    "Why not enter into a conversation about reforming the 2nd Amendment? It started as an empowerment statement of citizen rights to exert self control over protection of self, family and home  rather than to be submitted to an aristocratic or monarchic call to arms. It also guaranteed some measure of self protection  in circumstances where an officially established police force answerable to citizen control was non-existent. The role of the means of hunting - guns - as a way to engage in a  subsistence living culture was another powerful need and hence its appearance on the original Bill of Rights.\n\nIt is undisputable the Founding Fathers could not foresee the development of the types of killing devices that would take place under the subject: GUNs.\n\nThe ability of the 2nd amendment to serve as a citizen's empowerment statement  has been lethally  diminished  by the fighting over citizen ownership and use of  WMD.\n\nBy reforming the 2nd Amendment we can lay the noxious question over WMD to rest and replace it with more applicable protections of gun ownership and use. \n\nAt the same time citizens can expand the protection aspect of the 2nd amendment  by calling upon the 10th amendment - using the  unenumerated   powers granted to the people to design stronger citizen control over partisan politics. Having a citizen binding vote on government decisions of importance - such as military actions, budgets, judge confirmations, significant renting or selling of public land, tax reform and general taxation - might force Congress and lobbiests  to spend more  time explaining their bills to the people  than they do now.\n\nSimilarly if citizens had the legal right to actually assign their personal tax revenues to specific government tasks and withhold them from others, citizens would have a more timely way to express consent and dissent in a way that actually has power.  One way to break a congressional-caused log jam is to take away the current  control of those creating the log jam and give it to the group most affected by the government : the governed.\n\nThose in power might find this idea frightening, but isn't that one of the aspects of the 2nd amendment gun enthusiasts like the most?",

    "I really enjoy Eddie Glaude on these shows. And, unfortunately, he\u2019s right, at least to an extent. \n\nSimilar to when heroin was ravaging the black community. The response was tougher laws punishing the user and increased incarceration rates. The white community is now seeing similar rates of people using and dying due to opioids (begun from legal means) and heroin when the legal avenue is closed and a different response is being garnered - drug rehabs and increased pressure on manufacturers and doctors. \n\nGuns are following the tract that drugs have. Black communities have had outsized gun violence happening for decades with more of the solution focusing on incarceration. Unfortunately, now that the gun violence \u201ccreep\u201d is moving towards whites and more affluent schools and areas, the solutions being proposed focus on removing the weaponary, keeping guns out of the hands of younger people and mental health awareness. \n\nAs Eddie stated, PTSD and other mental health issues have not been addressed in the black community much before now but need to be looked at.

Populists are not pluralist. They consider just one group\u2014whatever they mean by \u201cthe people\u201d\u2014legitimate.Given their moral framing, populists conclude that they alone represent \u201cthe people.\nPopulists\u2014ranging from the revolutionary socialist Hugo Chavez in Venezuela to the religious conservative Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey\u2014have managed to portray themselves as victims even at the height of their power, blaming their shortcomings on sabotage by shadowy domestic or foreign elites.

    "1. In many states, you can be banned by federal law from buying a gun but still become an armed guard.\n\nIn more than half the country, armed guards are not required to go through a prohibited possessor check, the federal background check most people are required to go through when purchasing guns. Most states require criminal background checks, but eight states don\u2019t require anything at all \u2013 allowing felons and substance abusers, among others, to become guards with guns.\n\n2. Armed guards receive far less training than police officers.\n\nIn 15 states, armed guards do not have to take firearms training. In many other states, laws provide little specificity on what should be included in training curriculum, such as when and how to use force.\n\n3. Guards often shoot their guns with impunity.\n\nUnlike in police shootings, when an armed guard shoots a gun, regulators rarely investigate. Only 12 states have laws or rules requiring armed guards or their employers to report the use of their guns. Some of these states use the reports to investigate whether the guard acted safely and should remain licensed. But even where reports are required, many licensing agencies don\u2019t do anything with them, allowing reckless guards to remain on the job.\n\n4. A mental health evaluation is routine for police officers but not for armed guards.\n\nForty-six states do not require mental health exams for armed guard applicants.\n\n5. Some states knowingly license corrupt former law enforcement officers as armed guards.\n\nMost regulators don\u2019t bother to ask. Only one state checks whether an armed guard was once a law enforcement officer with a history of abuse. But even that state, Oregon, has never rejected an applicant for bad behavior as a law enforcement officer. Like the Orlando shooter, those who fail as officers or never make it through the academy find easy second careers as armed security guards. In Florida, we found that 13 percent of disciplined armed guards were former law enforcement officers with disciplinary histories or failing grades on their law enforcement training or exams.\n\n6. Armed guards increase the risk of violence.\n\nThe likelihood of violence during bank robberies tripled with an armed guard on duty, we found through a statistical analysis of FBI data. The job not only endangers the public, but armed guards themselves. When armed, 64 guards were hurt for every 1,000 bank robberies, compared with less than 1 injury per 1,000 robberies when unarmed.\n\n7. There\u2019s even an armed guard loophole.\n\nIn 31 states, armed guards hired directly by a business are not required to go through training or a background check.

What's also crazy is that there are black people and other types of people he attacks support him, such as Ben Carson, CJ Pearson, Silk and Diamond, Pastor Mark Burns, Sheriff David Clarke, Paris Dennard, Omarosa and every other black person turning them into brainwashed sellout uncle Toms, who really don't have a clue about history, yet they have the audacity to say that they respect black leaders such as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman, Madam CJ Walker, and other black leaders yet they continue to sellout their race, sure democrats started the KKK, but that what's in a different time, in the 1930s all of that changed and since republicans seem to have been associating with them and other racist hate groups, and they have the audacity to say that Black Lives Matters Movement is a terroist group it's a group of the black community dealing with issues such as racial profiling and police brutality, yet they don't want to see that cause they don't care about what issues black people go through. All republicans care about is discriminating others, their money, guns, and pleasing other greedy rich white male republicans, republicans are living in a fantasy and are very delusional, much like Trump supporters are. Anytime there's a shooting in concerts, schools, clubs, white police officers killing black men, or anywhere else, instead of helping out the victims, Trump makes matters worse as he is constantly encouraging hate and bigtory, and people have the audacity to say Obama started this and divided all this are wrong, the people who hated Obama are the ones who divided the country with their hate and bigtory, especially Trump who constantly attacked Obama mostly because he's black and he was jealous of him, much like he's jealous of other people of color, democrats, and women like Bill, Hillary, Oprah, Megyn, and anyone else, because he cannot take it and he starts running to Twitter like a 12-year-old girl, attacking them creating racist, sexist, and hateful remarks about them, yet his supporters who continue to live in a fantasy who take up for him, and they continue to say that CNN is fake news because they are intimidated by smart and intelligent people and real facts, and for that Trump supporters is and will always be very delousional.

On the Republican side you have two candidates with six marriages between them, very public adultery and very public divorces. On the Democratic side you have a Candidate whose spouse committed infidelity and rather than abandon her marriage, the Candidate worked hard to try to repair their marriage and make it work. Isn't that the idea behind the commitment of marriage? There is NO comparison here.

And, here we are. Rudy probably \"fixes\" stuff for his clients all the time, because they're getting paid well to do it.

Each case he has ever been apart of should now be reviewed. \n\nI know many of you will bring up Parks vs Palmer. An although it does set presedence it is not a common practice and in many states a lawyer can be brought before an ethics committee and even disbarred. \n\nWhen the president said he knew of the payment it did three things. Relieved Cohen of an ethics hearing; bought Trump client atty privilege and put Trump in the hot seat for campaign finance violations. It doesn't matter if he paid the money back. Conways husband tweeted the statute. And yes Giuliani was right it's just a fine. So he's he going for the lowest charge. But Cohen funneling money from att and others put put him back on the ethics list and reduced trumps chances of client atty privilege.

They (the children) may not even know their own last name, or know where their parents are from.\r\n\r\nHow would a parent go about finding a child who is still learn to speak, in Spanish or English? \r\n\r\nIf a child can not read how will they know where they (even the parent) were sent from or know where they are being kept?

We owe ourselves better than this, we owe our children better than this.

    "The solution to re-unification of the children with their families is simple .... a government document should be developed with picture and known data on each child and distributed to those detained. If known, the childs name, country of origin, where the child is being housed, and a phone # to get more information on reunification. This is the ONLY way this is going to  reunify at least a majority of these families.Such a  document will accomplish much besides reunification. It will give us an accurate (or close to accurate)how many children are in custody, when they came into the system, where they came from and much more.  This could be easily implemented with the assistance of a non-partisan organization like the American Red Cross (who has offered) but the Trump administration and the GOP will not grant them access to any of these facilities. If access is not granted  this will be just another black hole like Trumps  Puerto Rico Debacle. This software is already available and used in every elementary school across the country but our head of HHS is so-o-o-o unqualified, she doesn't know this.

Kennedy committed what is widely viewed as one of the most ignominious acts in modern American history: he authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation to begin wiretapping the telephones of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Kennedy believed that one of King's closest advisers was a top-level member of the American Communist Party, and that King had repeatedly misled Administration officials about his ongoing close ties with the man. Kennedy acted reluctantly, and his order remained secret until May of 1968, just a few weeks after King's assassination and a few days before Kennedy's own.

NIXON\u00a0thru\u00a0In re BRUCE R. LINDSEY].\n\nThe disclosure of this legal analysis by the Trump administration is curious because\u00a0Bannon, like White House counsel Don McGahn and former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus,\u00a0is represented by\u00a0William Burck, a white-collar defense lawyer at the white-shoe\u00a0law-firm Quinn Emanuel. Prosecutors don\u2019t particularly love it when a lawyer represents multiple people in their crosshairs \u2014 in large part because the lawyer can get all his clients in a room and triangulate their stories so they match up.\u00a0Bannon himself hasn\u2019t been a\u00a0big fan\u00a0of Trump\u2019s legal team, which has made its share of\u00a0tragicomic errors\u00a0and continues to\u00a0feed the fantasy\u00a0that Mueller will soon wrap up his investigation [manipulated by Burck's\u00a0rooty-toot-whatta-hoot-au-cahoots put over on selfie-stoopid\u00a0DHILLON].\n\nBut the fact that he and Mueller will sit down for a chat is still remarkable, if only because of Bannon\u2019s proven ability \u2014 until now, anyway \u2014 to be a ghost in all things Russia [uh, nuh; see Wolff's Fire and Fury w/Bannon-anna ultra-prominent, esp. in re JARVANKA]. Pick just about any of the major milestones in Mueller\u2019s sprawling investigation into Russia\u2019s disruption of the 2016 presidential election, and the former White House strategist is simply nowhere to be found [Wolff, ibid].\n\nBannon, for one, hadn\u2019t yet joined the campaign when George Papadopoulos tried to procure \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton from Moscow and then let other campaign officials in on his quest. Neither was Bannon around when Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and Don Jr. met a cast of shady, Kremlin-linked figures who had also promised similar dirt. Bannon had nothing to do with Donald Trump\u2019s firing of James Comey, which Bannon has suggested, on national television to boot, was the\u00a0biggest mistake\u00a0in modern political history. And for all we know, he steered clear of any and all of Mike Flynn\u2019s questionable wheeling and dealing with the Russian ambassador \u2014 which Flynn lied to the FBI and the White House about and later got prosecuted for.\n\nMueller has already secured guilty pleas or indictments from four different targets [waymore than 4, all coopted into recruited] and likely has amassed a mountain of evidence implicating others that we may never see \u2014 culled from dozens of interviews from White House and campaign officials, intelligence assessments, financial transactions, and thousands of emails and other records from all corners of Trumpworld.\u00a0As I\u2019ve written before, we know a lot of Mueller\u2019s work, but in the grand scheme of things, we know nothing at all [exc. for the hiding-in-plain-sight SPECIAL GRAND JURY factors].\n\nSo what might Mueller\u2019s investigators want to talk to Bannon about? The Washington\u00a0Post\u2019s Greg Sargent has\u00a0suggested\u00a0a few direct questions \u2014\u00a0Did Trump order Flynn to lie to the FBI? What do you know about Comey\u2019s firing?\u00a0\u2014 but those are softballs for skilled prosecutors. At this stage of the Russia probe, Mueller is thinking in terms of specific criminal elements that he can lay out in a report to Congress, if not prove in a court of law. He already has an idea [he's already got the indictments off the top-shelf] about his case-in-chief \u2014 the assembly of facts and law that he hopes to [will] one day present to a jury and the American public.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret, for example, that one of the more\u00a0legally\u00a0compromised members\u00a0of Trump\u2019s inner circle is his son-in-law, Jared Kushner [see JARVANKA, above], and Mueller may either ask big, open-ended questions about anything Bannon knows about his\u00a0archnemesis\u00a0[asked and answered], or else put in front of him documents he may be familiar with [dittoed and\u00a0dittoed]. In Michael Wolff\u2019s controversial\u00a0Fire and Fury, for instance, the author writes: \u201cWith the president\u2019s assent, Kushner \u2026 gave [Stephen] Miller notes on why the FBI director should be fired and asked him to draft a letter that could set out the basis for immediate dismissal.\u201d Is Bannon familiar with these notes and why Trump may have directed Kushner to draft them in the first place?\u00a0[ditto cubed]\n\nWhatever Mueller\u2019s line of questioning, it will be in the former Breitbart impresario\u2019s best interest to tell the special counsel everything he knows about every meeting or decision when he was in the room. Keep in mind that the main reason Bannon attached himself to Trump was to advance his nationalist vision for America. Now that that project has failed and he\u2019s been thrown under the bus by just about everyone he helped rise to power, he\u2019s lost it all and has little else to lose by giving Mueller the keys to the kingdom [uh, nuh ... the script from the outset].",
    "The RepubliCons' House Committee tried to intimidate Bannon into giving false testimonies to Mueller before Mueller has the chance to meet with him! People have got to realize Trump and his RepubliCon accomplices in the Congress have been trying to undermine Mueller and his investigating team by smearing the reputations of the FBI, DOJ, as well as Mueller and his staff in the hope that if Mueller and his team of instigators found any crimes that Trump had committed they can throw out all the evidence that they have found by accusing them of wrong doing even though Trump and his RepubliCon accomplices have absolutely no evidence of any wrong doing by the FBI, DOJ, or Mueller! \n\nIt's simply a case of Trump trying to get off of prosecution by accusing the very people who are responsible for investigating him and he knows they have very strong evidence of his crimes since he has committed loads and loads of them over the years! It has always been Trump's M.O. to accuse others of the very crimes he is guilty of! The closer Mueller is to exposing Trump's crimes, the louder we are going to hear Trump and his RepubliCon accomplices scream and cry about the investigation being unfair and unethical! But we all know innocent people don't go out of their ways to interfere with an investigation unless they are guilty of the crimes and have something to hide!\n\nAlso, I want to let people know how hard it has been for Mueller to ask people for interviews since Nunes, the head of the House Committee, has to approve of the people that Mueller wants to interview! Since Nunes is Trump's right-hand man, as far as being his henchman in trying to interrupt the Mueller's investigation, has been refusing to let Mueller interview many key witnesses that are vital to his investigation of Trump! \n\nIf anyone has studied the RepubliCon Party to a certain extent, he/she would know the Mafia style the RepubliCons use to intimidate and cover up crimes that their party members are guilty of! God bless Mr. Mueller and his staff for doing their best to bring Trump to justice for the crimes that he has committed despite the difficulty they faced by the corrupt RepubliCon Party! But in the end the good guys will win and justice shall prevail!",

THAT agenda has been exceptionally successful.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that a lot of vocal, well-armed, and rabid adherents to Trump are waiting for their belief in the prerequisite to the Second Coming - the occurrence of Armageddon.

    "Is a snake-oil salesman, has always been a snake-oil salesman and will never be anything more than a snake-oil salesman, oh, and reality (?) TV showman!  Soon, trump's cult members will find out just how badly they have been be deceived. Trump and his rich congress members lied to them about the huge tax cut they gave themselves. Now, they have to find that money to get it back, the schools will be privatized. This is why they've made sure the schools seem like they are failing, it is part of the plan to privatize them. I felt bad for the teachers out there marching for money for better schools and pay, they are taking 9.2 billion dollars out of the system. Anybody who knows how to google, can fact check this and find out about it. Ben Carson already raised rents on low income housing. People are losing their Medicaid and food stamps. They are hitting the safety nets for the elderly and the poor. trump's tariffs most likely came from the billionaires who are running him, none of them care how it affects trump's cult members! Google the CPAC convention to listen to Steve Bannon (he was Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah's front man) and Reince Priebus tell the world what our government would look like under these billionaire Libertarians. I'm talking about the Mercers who joined forces with Charles and David Koch, in 2011. It has taken them decades to over throw the Republican Party, in 2016 it became the Oligarchy Party with the millionaire and billionaire congress members the Oligarchs. Pay close attention to Bannon saying this: \"Take these (rich) cabinet appointees, they were all hand picked to, 'NEUTER,' the agency they will head.\" Bannon could say that, because he and Rebekah Mercer sat on trump's transition team telling him which rich person to hire for what office. Rebekah told trump to hire Jeff Sessions, maybe that is why he wasn't fired. It was Rebekah who told her friend Ivanka she wanted to giver her dad a campaign contribution, but he had to hire the Mercer's 'people, he did and hired Koch Bros 'people,' too. Ted Cruz was the chosen person, Mercer gave his campaign 11 million, we know he quit, so they turned to trump. As front-man for the Mercer's it was Bannon's job to attach himself to a candidate he could groom to win the election. Bannon needed to get his hands on the government in order to dismantle it, so these Libertarians could form a self-serving government, he did it. Bannon had to get rid of the EPA, so there would be no restrictions on their greedy pursuit of more wealth and power, trump was the perfect choice! So, Scott Pruitt shredded the EPA for them. Betsy DeVos only needed to look pretty and stand by while the school system is under siege by these people. If you google: ALEC EXposed, you can find out how the Koch Bros. have been able to manipulate themselves into our government. If you google, the Citizens United, you'll find out this came from the Koch Bros. through ALEC. These men work in abject secrecy and always have. The Koch Bros. have always sold themselves as doing good for America, when their behavior is self-serving. Now, Citizens United, the Koch's co-founded and funded in 1988, (the Supreme Court gave them a bonus, deeming corporations, PEOPLE. The Kochs have the second largest privately owned company in the USA) is the reason these people had to get rid of Hillary. Hillary said, not just once, if she won the election she was getting rid of Citizen's United and was also going to cap the money corporations could give to a politician, they couldn't have that!! The Mercers funded everything Bannon needed to push trump into the presidency. Mercer threw a ton of money into creating a 'war room,' for Bannon, the Government Accountability Institute. The GAI had one purpose, to dig up dirt on the opponent, true or not and hand it off to a news agency to run it. Every nasty lie trump people believe about Hillary and Bill Clinton, came right from these people!! It was lucky for the death of Andrew Breitbart, where Mercer was concerned, he sunk 10 million dollars into his newspaper in 2012, Bannon was heading it. To prepare trump to talk to people he'd otherwise have nothing to do with, unless they were doing grunt work for him, they had trump's campaign lay out a couple million dollars to send trump to Mercer's Cambridge Analytica. They were using the military and police forces method of PSYOP'S. The art of playing upon people's emotions, to get them to do what you want them to do and behave, it worked for trump. The downside of Cambridge is trump came out a cult leader, nothing near a president!! A very intelligent young man with pink hair, who worked for Cambridge became a whistle blower, so outed before the public, Mercer is taking out bankruptcy. Somehow, these tariffs are connected to these billionaires, their aim is to have zero tariffs! trump made a deal with Rebekah for these billionaires, they run his domestic and foreign policies and he got millions from the Mercers. I think trump was hard up for money, the reason he decided to run for president, it has been very lucrative for him and his family!!",

    "Wakeup call for Congresscritters:\nYou now have clear evidence of things that go WELL beyond the definition of \"high crimes and misdemeanours\". After spending 18 months with head in the sand and fingers in your ears, you now face a situation where you CANNOT deny what we all can see. So now the ball is in YOUR court, and the question is, what are you going to do about it.\n If you are an elected official, you took a solemn oath to serve the American people (at least those in your district who elected you) and the Constitution of the United States. You NEVER took any oath of loyalty to the President (Or if you did, it was one that has no valid purpose or precedent). So now it is time to decide whether you want to DO YOUR JOB, and start \"defending the Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic,\" or whether you want to shackle your fortunes to those of a habitual liar and proven con-man, who may even be a puppet of a hostile foreign government. \n\n If you choose the former, then you need to start exercising the powers assigned to you under the Constitution. You dont even NEED to impeach at this point, since you could easily nail him for violation of the emoluments clause, which the entire Trump administration has been flagrantly violating since Day One. If you choose the latter, then that bond shall be forever inseparable . . . you will follow Trump to whatever end he meets. \n\nPersonally, I think the best way to deal with these scum -- not only the Puppenfurher, but also all his enablers in Congress -- is to shave their heads, strip them naked and parade them through the streets of DC, while the High Septon follows behind them ringing a bell, and intoning:  \"Shame! . . .

    "Trump donates salary for second consecutive quarter\n\nBy John Kruzel on Wednesday, July 26th, 2017 at 4:37 p.m.\n\nFor the second quarter in a row, President Donald Trump declined to take a salary and opted instead to gift the quarterly installment to a government entity, this time to the Department of Education.\n\nAt a White House press briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders presented a check for $100,000 to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\nDeVos said the funding would go toward hosting a camp for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students at the Department of Education.\n\n\"We want to encourage as many children as possible to explore STEM fields in the hope that many develop a passion for these fields,\" DeVos said.\n\nTrump donated his first quarter salary of about $78,000 to the National Park Service.\n\nSanders said the first quarter funds went toward restoring two projects at a national battlefield. She added that additional donations brought the total first quarter gift to over $260,000.\n\nTrump's donations are consistent with the billionaire businessman's campaign pledge to forgo a salary if elected.\n\nUntil the policy becomes a permanent fixture of Trump's presidency, we're rating Trump's promise In the Works.",

    "Gaslighting? (A.M. Cox) So I looked it up, and what an interesting read Wikipedia's entry \"Gaslighting government\" turned out to be. Short but to the point, probably a bit coloured\u00a0by recent events and experiences\u00a0in the United States since the election of 2016.\u00a0But among others it contains this sentence: \"Gaslighting governments cannot actually occur in real democracies\". Hmh.\nSecondly, many people have a rather short harboring-critical-doubts span. Which is totally normal.\u00a0After a while they just let up, and go along with things. Authoritarianism\u00a0knows this, and needs this passive\u00a0re-alignment\u00a0very much. It's how the protagonists of\u00a0authoritarian politics\u00a0succeed in shifting the nation's\u00a0base lines in their favor, even though they are doing so from a seemingly hopeless\u00a0minority position,\u00a0at least at first. Such has been happening in the US. While ending a not only politically stressful and demanding 2017, and going into the year of the mid-term elections, enough people start to\u00a0let their defences down, yearning for\u00a0being able to approve of things\u00a0again.\u00a0Because `it\u00b4, or `they\u00b4, won't stop hammering this part of the bewildered\u00a0populace into submission.\nTo sum this up: 2018\u00a0will prove to present yet more heated up debates, and strenuous divisiveness.

    "\"The CIA, which is now headed by a Trump loyalist, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, has at times been reluctant to stay involved in the operation, apparently for fear of obtaining the Trump-related material offered by the Russians, according to sources close to the negotiations. In the period in which the communications channel has been open, CIA officials are said to have repeatedly changed their views about it. They have sometimes expressed interest, only to later back away from any involvement with the channel and the intermediaries. At some points, the CIA has been serious enough about buying materials through the channel that agency officials said they had transported cash to the CIA\u2019s station in Berlin to complete the transaction. But at other points, agency officials backed off and shut down their communications. Some people involved with the channel believe that the CIA has grown so heavily politicized under Pompeo that officials there have become fearful of taking possession of any materials that might be considered damaging to Trump.\n\nThe CIA\u2019s wariness shows that the reality within the U.S. intelligence community is a far cry from the right-wing conspiracy theory that a \u201cdeep state\u201d is working against Trump. Instead, the agency\u2019s behavior seems to indicate that U.S. intelligence officials are torn about whether to conduct any operations at all that might aid Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into whether Trump or his aides colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMany intelligence officials are reluctant to get involved with anything related to the Trump-Russia case for fear of blowback from Trump himself, who might seek revenge by firing senior officials and wreaking havoc on their agencies. For example, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence and thus the man supposedly in charge of the entire U.S. intelligence community, has said he does not see it as his role to push for an aggressive Trump-Russia investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter.\"\nhttps://theintercept.com/2018/02/09/donald-trump-russia-election-nsa/",

    "I grew up in this country and have NEVER taken democracy for granted. It's true that I was a highly inquisitive kid (I was reading serious books about fascism/totalitarianism, and other political \"isms\", as well as general history, by age 11), and I grew up in a much more cynical age (the 80's and 90's) than previous generations, but many of my peers who did not share my studiousness also felt that the US was in trouble and that the fragility of democracy, liberty, civil rights, etc. was a given in this world. \n\n\nI hate to say that my fears about the insecurity of democracy, especially as the decades went by and my knowledge grew and the political climate became more extreme and partisan, have only been vindicated. I strongly believe that we may be living in the end times of American liberal democracy (and perhaps Western liberal democracy in toto) and that this didn't start and won't end with 45*. This far-right radicalism, the actual undermining of democratic norms as the demographics decidedly turned against republicans, started in the 80's (or even 70's as a reactionary backlash against the civil rights gains in the 60's), accelerated in the Bush Jr. years, and even under Obama (they obstructed him whenever possible, and Obama also pushed some police/military-state-esque policies or didn't really try to end the ones Bush Jr enacted). The repubs stopped being able to win fairly, so they engaged in massive voter suppression and gerrymandering to gain and attain power, and, once in, extremist tactics to block legislation and appointments they didn't like. That's not what a healthy democracy does; the slow decay of US democracy is not new, and 45* is it's logical outcome: a symptom, but not the cause. We have to reclaim our democratic institutions or else the US will fall into a kind of christian fascist plutocracy where only rich, straight, white, christian, conservative males have any real rights to speak of; just as mostly been the reality historically.",

Last time I looked they are all full grown adults, responsible for their actions.They have acted as one, a class of bullies, the Street Gang, the Posse behind the Perpetrator and so far have suffered nothing, absolutly nothing, no consequence for their actions. Nothing of consequence has happened, no wars started, no global market crash,  no 9/11 no flinging open the gates of an Auschwitz to view the hollowed out skeletons of unspeakable atrocity to make someone pay for the inhumanity of it all, the death of fundamental moral character. Even the abject hypocrisy of Christians singing in the pews on Sunday and spitting on a woman wearing a hijab in a grocery store cannot shake us. We look at the angry mob and give them a free pass, \"Victims\" of the system?!!  Pawns of the 0.001% who used them? Used their grievances to pit brother against brother while they robbed the till behind their backs laughing all the way to the bank? I dont think so anymore.

Bulls*it!. When the bully starts bloodying the noses of the kindergarteners in the schoolyard, starts stealing their lunch money and stomping their homework into the mud it's because the gang behind them made it happen.

Nostradamus even made a reference to the recent massacre within the Jewish temple in Pittsburgh (a \"chapel stained with blood\"), during a quatrain which alludes to the ascendancy of the Antichrist. Want to be even more creeped out..? That same quatrain references \"the empire contracted to another one,\" which could be a reference to Trump's relationship with Putin, and it even mentions the \"rigged\" 2016 election. Here is the entire quatrain, for your consideration... written 400 years ago by Nostradamus: \n\n*The false message about the rigged election* \n*to run through the city stopping the broken pact;* \n*voices bought, chapel stained with blood,* \n*the empire contracted to another one* \n\nPretty eerie stuff. That phrase \"voices bought\" could be taken several ways... big money in politics, Trump's followers being bought off with lies about their taxes, etc. I need to mention that I do not personally believe in the occult. But it is interesting. The same Nostradamus predicted that the third Antichrist would be named \"Hister\" (Hitler) and he was off by only one letter. Nostradamus did not give a definite name for the fourth Antichrist... referring to him only as \"unknown\" or \"Mabus.\" The name \"Mabus\" has exactly the same number of letters as \"Trump\" and both names contain the letters \"m\" and \"u.\" _Cue the Twilight Zone music here..._",

That's it, and he leveraged that into a bunch of failed businesses before becoming a TV reality star.  Which he and his people brag about.  Pretending to be a businessman on TV isn't a transferable skills set!  Apart from the part where gullible people started to believe make-believe was reality, which he still relies on.  That doesn't make it a useful skill for his actual job, which isn't making himself look good.  He can't get things done (other than a tax cut for the rich), he can't get Republicans elected, and he doesn't even like being President.

Trump realizes that he has to do whatever he can to keep Mueller at bay.Secondly Trump has hired a hawkish John Bolton who will ramp up the rhetoric for more aggressive moves to push this adminstration closer to some kind of international conflict. Thus Trump will  continue trying to  fight off allegations of sexual assault and sexual harrassment, in order to give justification to the issue of him remaining in the White House in order to deal with North Korea or  Iran. Finally, with all of these issues banging on the doors of the White House, he may use the tensions and conflicts to justify his rational for being re- elected and to convince voters that his new administration will be able to deal with the conflicts he's created as a smoke screen to remain in office. \nHe wants  to create chaos in order to build up  tensions that will divert America's attention of what the real issue is. And that is the investigation coming from Robert Mueller. If he can keep it going during the midterms that will be his game plan up to the point of the 20/20 reelectoon cycle. \nHe recognizes that  voters  will be anxious and less likely  to seek impeachment while in the midst of international turmoi with either Iran or North Korea. He did this before with North Korea and Syria. Threatening Kim Jon Un while launching misslie strikes against Syrian forces.Talking about pre emtive  Nuclear strikes.  That was during the early stages of Muellers investigation.  Watch and see how he manuvers his players and how he will seek to change the narrative away from himself.",

    "The Bush family were German nobility that branched off from the House of Bussche. The Bussche family ruled as feudal lords in the regions of Ravensberg and Osnabruck located in Westphalia. The House of Bussche had several family branches in the Holy Roman Empire and the Bush family are one of them. The German word for Bush is Busch. In their region of Osnabruck it was governed by Catholic Prince-Bishops which were given their authority by the Pope of Rome. The movement of protesting against Roman-Papal authority rose up in Osnabruck so they brought in the Jesuits to combat the protesters of Rome. The University of Osnabruck was then turned into a Jesuit University for a short period of time. Jeb Bush is a Roman Catholic convert and a fourth degree Knight of Columbus. Bush Sr's grandfather George Herbert Walker was Jesuit educated from Stonyhurst College. Adolphus Busch was an ancestor of the former Bussche family of Westphalia and the co-founder of the Anheuser-Busch beer company. The Sons of Silence biker gang use the Anheuser-Busch logo. The Bussche family are also intermarried with German-Dutch royalty like the House of Lippe. The Peirce name from Barbara Pierce-Bush comes from the Percy family who are British Peers and Dukes of Northumberland. The Percy family also settled a covert family branch in Mississippi which became politicians and plantation owners with their Trail Lake plantation. Thomas Walker was an ancestor of the Bush family and was a British slave trader. John and Francis Walker were politicians in Virginia that helped to transform the Virginia Company into the United States. I believe the Walker family are closely related descendants of the Templer family of Devon. The Bush family are like the royal family of the United States working as princes under the authority of the House of Windsor which have German ancestry. George Herbert Walker Bush is a Knight of the House of Windsor's Order of the Bath. The CIA headquarters is called George Bush Center for Intelligence because the Bush family have a continual authority over DC and the CIA as the highest level political family in the United States.\n\nAxel von dem Bussche was a Nazi solider who \"planned to assassinate Adolf Hitler\" which is just another one of the many lies told by this wicked family similar to \"weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\" The German royal and noble families helped to engineer Hitler and the Nazis. The Windsor family changed their name under King George V who was from the House of Glucksburg and House of Saxe Coburg and Gotha and both of these families were involved with the Nazis. King Edward VIII of the House of Windsor was a Nazi supporter. Prescott Bush's Union Banking Corporation was holding gold for Nazis and was shut down under the \"trading with the enemy act.\" J. Bush & Co. was a continuation of the Union Banking Corporation and founded by Skull and Bonesman Jonathan Bush. J. Bush & Co. was bought by Riggs Bank which absorbed into PNC Financial Services after allowing money laundering into Saudi Arabia. George Bush was investigated for insider trading of shares in Harken Energy Corp which purchased his Spectrum 7/Abrusto Energy company which was financed by James Bath a business associate of the bin Laden family. Vannevar Bush oversaw the Manhattan Project as the head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development and was also the founder of Raytheon. Steven Walker is the Director of DARPA today. Wesley G. Bush runs Northrop Grumman as CEO, President and Chairman. The Bush family basically own and run the Military Industrial Complex and are using Directed Energy Weapons on civilians. Prescott Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, the banker Jonathan Bush, and George Bush were all initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society at Yale. John M. Walker was the uncle of George Bush Sr. and also Skull and Bones. John Walker was an investment banker whose firm G.H. Walker, Laird & Co. absorbed into Merrill Lynch. The Nazi SS used the Skull and Bones symbol. The Skull and Bones secret society at Yale is a military council which is why George Bush Sr. started the Gulf War and George Bush Jr. started the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Bush family are war profiteers. The Skull and Bones also use military and war for recruiting soldiers into paramilitary death squads which are used inside the United States for persecution and covert assassinations. The Bush family are mass murdering war criminals, terrorists, war profiteers, and an all around menace to humanity.",

Katherine Hepburn, Audrey Hepburn, Billie Holiday, the queen of England, Magaret Thatcher  are examples of 'presence'.",

Once he was discovered the fraud he was, he lost his power.  \n\nTrump honestly thought the job of running a country would be easy, he has often said 'he likes things to be easy.'

They do not hold power accountable and  getting your news from mainstream news is propaganda.  Having news organizations working to uncover corruption and informing the citizens of the corruption is important.  That is why we need journalists who are not bought off by large corporations.

    "Tur demonstrates her political naivete when she says the electoral college is something to be preserved. A good argument can be made that it discourages campaigning in all 50 states (just ask Clinton about the impact of not campaigning in WI, MI, and PA, states she thought she had wrapped up). Smart politicians plan their campaigning to get 270 EV's, not to maximize their popular vote, which means they tend to ignore states they can't win or states they are guaranteed to win. In every other election at every level it's the majority that wins, and that should be true for election to the highest office.\n\nThe argument that the EC insures small states don't get ignored glosses over the fact that small states end up wielding vastly outsized political influence because of the EC. At its heart the EC is a political compromise over slavery and a way to deal with the slow means of communication and travel in the 18th century. Neither of those conditions exist now which makes the electoral college an unnecessary and undemocratic anachronism. It's long past time to eliminate the electoral college and popularly elect the President!",

    "I'm a bit of an aspiring political analyst, so here's my take:\n\n\nWhile I agree with Katy that Trump has a chance of reelection, I'd put it at no better than a 50% chance as of now. The American people overwhelmingly agree that Trump is tearing apart the country even more than it already was before he came along. I'd like to think that they would recognize that it is a danger to the nation to have such a divisive figure in such a high position. The truth is that Trump got a smaller vote share than Romney overall, and in most swing states that he won, Trump got fewer votes than the winner of those states in 2012. While I acknowledge that there is such thing as an Obama-Trump voter, and Democrats would do well to pursue them, they might still be able to win without them. \n\nBut this doesn't excuse either side for denigrating the other side's supporters. The press needs to do a better job at covering supporters of candidates so that there isn't as much division. In conclusion, both sides simply don't understand one another, and the natural human reaction is to sneer at the other.",

    "These Elites create money based on the systems of distribution they create.  'Share The Wealth' is their Modus Operandi amongst themselves.  They use the US Prison system as one mechanism to distribute funds, and another less known system of slavery is Native American Tribes.  They issue 'grants' to only Federally Recognized Tribes, their 'indentured slaves by threat of violence = Treaties', and the Tribes are then under obligation to pay fees back into the system, up the chain of command.  The Tribes all pay 'donations' to Democratic PACs and individual Democratic campaigns and other .orgs and people in the system.  For instance, my Tribe held an 'awards dinner' to thank the NW BIA Director for his 'service' to our Tribe, giving him many awards, including a $10,000 check!  This was in addition to the quarterly $50k fee we pay to his office yearly.  All Tribes governments are obliged to conduct business this way, in order to continue to receive the right to be a 'recognized' Tribe. Try to escape the system, and without declaring war, the Feds will arraign its forces against that Tribe.  It is extortion.

    "Chuck Todd's pen pal analysis was right about Trump's lack of party loyalty. But, he's wrong about Trump putting country before party. He only aligns himself with other positions if it's good for Trump. Trump's most extreme base will probably not leave him. But, pen pal is also wrong about 2020. It's a mistake to make a prediction about 2020 using a static snapshot of today's national attitude or voting pool demographics. It's a dynamic picture. \n\nVoting blocks by age demographic is one factor that will be felt more keenly in 2020 than it was in 2016. I doubt that the amount of older Trump voters lost will be completely replaced by the 'angry young meme'  Trump supporters. It's a historical fact that younger voters don't vote in the numbers that older voters do. \n\nThe oldest two generations are losing voters and, as of 2016, Millennials had already replaced Boomers as the largest generational cohort. They are also no longer the youngest of eligible voters; meaning if long term historical trends hold, they will turnout to vote in larger numbers than in 2016. And, in terms of liberal verses conservative, the Millennial generation leans more left than right, further tilting the voting block against Trump's loyal base.  \n\nWhile social media certainly has helped to create opportunities for increased activism, it doesn't equate to a similar increase in voter turnout. Then there's the vote for change. It was this factor more than any other that put Trump in the White House. But vote for change is only effective the first term.",

By voting this out of committee before listening to others and without taking the additional step of a directed investigation proves the Republicans capable of running a Kangaroo Court.

Grassley's attitude is \"If I can't see it, it doesn't exist\". With that kind of thinking the world is still flat and he fails to comprehend 99.9% of science. These Republicans hired someone else to question Dr Ford so they would not be tainted by the process. However, by failing to get the basic information before forming a conclusion, these Republicans have effectively spit on every woman in America.

Here's hoping I'll have better endurance skills at quelling my turning political stomach at next month's attempt so that some time before the 2020 elections I might be able to completely view the totality of one of her newsy performances. It seems to be important somehow to certain people whose opinions I respect to be able to endure them to see just how deeply flawed this facade of MSNBC's \"leftish\" counter balance to Faux News Corporation's rabid fringe right wing is. Such is the anemic state of the American lifeblood of its Fourth Estate. Seems like it was hardly worth writing Freedom of the Press into The First Amendment seeing how easily corporations that lionize a massively bloody misreading of The Second Amendment have bought out the American press outlets to have them wither on their talent deprived vines, all of which have been purposefully infected with the deadly virus of \"infotainment uber alles.",

There were even talks that they both may have to leave the WH - well Trump showed very clearly that this can NEVER happen ! He will terminate EVERYBODY who is standing in the way of his daughter and her husband ! Now the media says that Trump will be his own chief of staff - of course he is ! This way only he will decide who is getting what information top secret or not ! He does not want anybody to tell him to whom he is going to give classified information ! John Kelly made that mistake and now he is out !",

The lawyers can't contain him, so it would make them look bad, which in turn would be bad for their business as lawyers.",
    "Why did he had to be a Senior Adviser to do all this? Why didn't he just remain a private citizen since he was still invested in his family business? He wouldn't be under investigation right now if he just stayed low. Everybody knows that Trump is advised by everyone but the right people, Fox News has a major roll on that - he even gets employees to work for him from there. The way it looks, he would have made more than half of that money as a private citizen that is connected to the president of US, without being under investigation.",

There is a reason why Trump gives Kushner and his kids confidential and sensitive missions they are not qualified for--organized crime bosses can only trust family.

It has always been about race they can't tolerate that a black man was president.

    "I applaud your excellent and important reporting Ms. Maddow! I have been posting for months on various news sites asking WHY Trump had still NOT sanction Russia, and why no one had been really reporting on it! There has been brief comments about this despicable and clearly corrupt Administration and its ignorant Leader about missing the deadlines to implement the sanctions, but nothing truly in depth! I am also saddened to see that the stories you are covering, are not on all of the other programs on CNN or MSNBC!\nWhy hasn\u2019t any other show, present the recently de-classified letter from the Obama administration that you showed on your segment about the quandary that Obama and his team were out in because of their knowledge of Flynn and his conspiracy with Kissliak on the sanctions? The Democrats should be ALL OVER the document, I have no idea why the Republicans, or at least Lindsay seems to think it might help them! The fact is that Trump and his team had promised to remove any sanctions on Russia, and the fact that Trump refuses to sanction Russia, even though the majority of senate/congress had made it illegal to not do so!\nThe fact that Trump has not done so, is very disturbing! While the man is clearly ignorant, he has to realize that not sanctioning Russia, makes h8m look guilty! and it also gives more fodder to the Democrats ( who quite honestly need to be talking about it, causing more concern about this issue as well as the fact that Kuschner is still working with classified information) Id also really like to know how Trump could get security clearance. Are presidential candidates not vetted? Do they not have to complete the same documents and have the same investigations done by the FBI? it seems pretty ridiculous, if they aren\u2019t. I can understand not making a President get one, but they should never get to be President if they cant qualify for clearance!\nMore people need to become aware of Trump\u2019s failure to sanction Russia almost a year later! \nTrump is either very scared of Putin or is into him for ALOT of money. I dont think they are partners though! Putin might be letting Tr7mp think so, by stroking his ego! There was a week or two, when every time Trump was speaking that he\u2019d go on and on about how he was told, or had heard that Putin thinks that Trump is a very intelligent man. Of course Putin has laughed and denied this. Trump is clearly frightened of the investigation, because of his guilt, ( most likely not just his conspiracy with Russia, but also the multiple counts of obstruction and numerous money crimes) but his refusal to go against Russia, makes me certain that whatever it is that Putin has on him, or will have done to him if he doesn\u2019t comply, he is much more scared of it, then of impeachment or possible jail time.\nI mostly hope that Karmas alias is Muelleur, but Id be okay with it being Putin!!\neither way, he must be stopped, he so desperately wants to rule like a king, or more likely a DICTATOR he isn\u2019t just a danger to America , he is a threat to the entire planet!\nKeep holding their feet to the flames! I admire you and want to say thank you!\nI am doing everything I can to get your reports out to as many people as I can, what you are doing is far from fake, we need media with integrity, or we risk letting Trump become the Dictator he longs to be, his military parade just more proof and his calls of fake news is a tried and true practice employed by all past and present Strongmen and Dictators!\nPlease keep doing what you are doing, without you, and your fellow reporters and journalists, all would be lost!",

    "How can that not be corruption at the highest levels!!! This is quid pro quo is it not, shouldn\u2019t Trump and his administration be charged for corrupt behaviour by letting Russia help them win?! Is it not obvious that Trump knew he was getting help and enthusiastically accepted it!!!!",
    "If the Russians hack our next election I believe we will be very near if not actually in a new revolutionary war. I don\u2019t see the American people taking a rigged election \ud83d\uddf3very well..................................",
    "I myself personally wonder if the Russians may have atempted to buy more of the GOP then we actually realize,,,, whoever does the most to get the sanctions lifted on Russia  I suppose would be compensated by the Russians,,,, treason,,,, straight up!!!!!!",
    "Trump and Co. are worried about sanctions? Maybe because they should be banished to Russia--they've turned everyone here into Jan Brady--\"It's always Russia, Russia, Russia!\" If they exiled them to Devil's Island they'd have to rename it Shithole Island",
    "Good to see the guy being questioned by Angus King squirming in his chair a bit. Trump daren't impose sanctions on Russia. Before any GOP politician got my vote in future I'd want to know why they were so desperate to shut down an investigation into Russian interference. Is this Trump's idea of America first? Doesn't he mean America first as long as Putin approves.",
    "This is so obvious trump is a russian spy and you know what eveyone wants to know why mueller hasnt come out with anything yet .. i think mueller knows just how far the russians penetrated our political grounds &  the house and Senate wont do anything if he presents them with evidence because they are a part of the corruption and may wait till after November when the house and Senate goes from red to blue",
    "Angus King has renewed my faith in oold white men who are not afraid  to confront the facts concerning the non-implementation  of Congress' attempt to impose severe sanctions on Russia for meddling in our 2016 elections. Yes, they are getting their money's worth from Agent Orange and his ilk. Bigly. Sad, let me tell you. This man is everyman, and he is carrying heat in his demands for a clear answer as to why this country is in the sorry state is is today.",
    "The Russians interfering with the 2016 election is, IN FACT, AN ACT OF WAR. The SAME way that invading their land with military forces is. It doesn't matter if the attack is physical or not. If it results in physical damage to a nation's ability to function normally as a sovereign entity, THEN IT IS AN ATTACK. Trump and his enablers, AKA TRAITORS, DESERVE the needle and the firing squad.",
    "in a way we are at war with Russia if they do cyber attacks again with our midterm elections we have confirmation.  and the Russian Puppet the president of the United States is allowing this to happen I call this treason he's doing it for the money and that is a crime against the United States and the people who are proud to hold the United States flag and it's American Glory We Stand Tall and we say no not in my country",
    "I would be screaming in my mic about this if I were in a hearing. Do these dunces not realize that cyber-attacks are as CLEAR of an attack as a Pearl Harbor or 9/11? Do the old people running this country not realize that using sophisticated social engineering can in fact result in the endangerment of military assets the same as bombing a military base or a civilian business center?",
    "Sooo if people in power fight against this I can see one of two outcomes.\n\n1) we will have a new branch of the government.  Akin to aerospace and EPA but will finally have a cyberceurity arm of the federal government.  I know one exists but this will be stronger and more forceful with laws (swatting illegal downloads, pirate bays and even cyber bullying will have jail time effects) for privet citizens.\n\n2) we go to open cyberwarfare with Russia as America pushes Putin's political opponents in their elections as well.",
    "It is just unbelievable how spineless the GOP party is. In my book they ALL should be impeached for treason for obstructing justice and aiding and abetting this administration. The world is laughing at this pathetic sorry excuse of a Government of the USA.",
    "If ANYONE thinks that the Russians simply just waltzed in and did this on a whim has no clue as to what the Chinese, Koreans, and many other countless countries can do with cyberwarfare is living in a dream world. You think the Russians are bad wait til Kim Jong Un gets the the capability to do this thanks to the Russians.",
    "Wow! For an Independent Angus sure is mad about that Dem distraction - that fake news - that nothing burger! Will Trump be the first man in history to be President of both the United States and Russia? Please, Mr. President - go there! Go to Russia, be wonderful, work your magic!",
    "All this time, I've been assuming Trump was hands-off Russia because of what he may owe them or what personal financial gain he sees in keeping them happy. But now there seems to be a political angle. This may be over-simplistic, but if we do nothing against the next phase of Russian elections tampering, what the results be?  I mean, in what direction would Moscow want to tip the elections?  Call me crazy, but I don't think they want to see the Democrats gain power in the upcoming midterms.  This is bad... very, very bad.",
    "So what does Trump get in return? What's the leverage? Can't believe these guys are trying to pull this off in daylight, in front of the nation,in front of the Republicans.How long are you going to put up with this?",
    "For those who may not remember, Erik Prince, former CEO of Blackwater, is the brother of, wait for it, Betsy Devos, our supremely underqualified Secretary of Education!\n1:54 Take a good look at Obama's face. He doesn't seem very pleased with Trump's boss.",
    "@MSNBC, you should do more analysis on social media trolling by Russian state linked Internet Research Agency. This is ongoing not isolated to elections! See Nunez memo Russian trolling reporting by Mother Jones, The Nation, etc. Their efforts appear very extensive, and the intelligence agencies are in agreement that political meddling is occurring and has been occurring on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, who knows how many websites. If that issue isn\u2019t handled, the fight for democratic elections would be over. It\u2019s the Achilles heel. If a foreign power can influence public opinion to their advantage, the US population will succumb to their propaganda, then continually deny it is propaganda; instead calling those who report it \u201cfake news\u201d. Just look at how powerful propaganda in Russia is with Putin constantly garnering 80% plus approval. That\u2019s called political suppression not successful, free, open, and democratic elections. Truth no longer will matter at the stage when propaganda replaces factual reporting for anything related to politics.",
    "Watch Rex Tillerson's interview this past weekend on Faux Noise. It will make you angry! That moron simply sounds fatalist, as he is talking about Russia's plan to, once more, assault our Democracy.\n\nBob Mueller should quickly start dropping indictments on Con Don Chump and his corrupt minions.",
    "Here it is, the clear cut timeline of Trump's bidding for Putin through his handling of sanctions. I hold no shadow of a doubt about Trump's guilt anymore. He's not just stupid and trying to gain favor or anything like that, Trump has purposely worked with Putin to further both men's personal goals.\nTraitor.",
    "Republicans claim to love their country, it seems like anytime there's a republican president they don't care about helping others including the ones who are poor instead they stereotype people of color, women, and immigrants in a negative light, as they cut everything off, they also trash talk people of color, immigrants, and women, republicans don't have a clue about politics and history, they sound and act like atheists. Whenever there's a democrat president, republicans get jealous of them because they care about this country, and willing to help out all kinds of people, republicans start hating on them and create nonsensical rumors about them, because they hate what they're doing, Donald Trump is one of those republicans who are jealous and hateful, as he is constantly attacking women, immigrants, and people of color especially black people as he is constantly attacking them including black NFL players who kneel down during games. What's also crazy is that there are black people and other types of people he attacks support him, such as Ben Carson, CJ Pearson, Silk and Diamond, Sheriff David Clarke, Paris Dennard, Omarosa and every other black person turning them into brainwashed sellout uncle Toms, who really don't have a clue about history, yet they have the audacity to say that they respect black leaders such as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman, Madam CJ Walker, and other black leaders yet they continue to sellout their race, sure democrats started the KKK, but that what's in a different time, in the 1930s all of that changed and since then republicans seem to have been associating with them and other racist hate groups, and they have the audacity to say that Black Lives Matters Movement is a terroist group it's a group of the black community dealing with issues such as racial profiling and police brutality, yet they don't want to see that cause they don't care about what issues black people go through. All republicans care about is discriminating others, their money, and pleasing other greedy rich white male republicans, republicans are living in a fantasy and are very delusional, much like Trump supporters are. Anytime there's a shooting in concerts, schools, clubs, white police officers killing black men, or anywhere else, Trump makes matters worse as he is constantly encouraging hate and bigtory, and people have the audacity to say Obama started this and divided all this are wrong, the people who hated Obama are the ones who divided the country with their hate and bigtory, especially Trump who constantly attacked Obama mostly because he's black and he was jealous of him, much like he's jealous of other people of color, democrats, and women like Bill, Hillary, Oprah, Megyn, and anyone else, because he cannot take it and he starts running to Twitter like a 12-year-old girl, attacking them creating racist, sexist, and hateful remarks about them, yet his supporters who continue to live in a fantasy take up for him, and they continue to say that CNN is fake news because they are intimidated by smart and intelligent people and real facts, and for that Trump supporters is and will always be very delousional. Anyway have a nice day!!!",
    "I hope they get it under control soon. I live in Australia and I've experienced four bushfires personally, one I had to drive through like this man and one that nearly wiped out my house and a nearby town. Several of my friends lost their houses in that one and luckily not their lives, mostly thanks to the wonderful firefighters, many volunteers, that risked their lives to keep us safe. Many came in from other states to help.\nMy thoughts are with the residents and firefighters that they stay safe.",
    "As I wait to hear trump and other republican politicians say \"This has nothing to do with climate change\"........... you guys are beyond moronic! Just wait..... it's gonna get a lot worse.",
    "VOTE BLUE! VOTE BLUE! VOTE BLUE!  VOTE BLUE IN NOVEMBER and remove the criminal GOP and impeach traitor trump in December 2018! #bluewave! All patriotic Americans must vote BLUE to return America to the Americans !",
    "9m. \"he's dirtying himself.\" Everybody who gets in contact with Donald Trump, bar none, gets tainted, confused, criminalized, destroyed or worse. This means that everybody who still works for Trump, must have a hidden agenda that is worth all of the humiliation and risks, otherwise nobody would put up with it. \nIf this is true, then where is the analysis of such agenda's? For instance, what is Giuliani's agenda? And Kelly's? And Sessions' agenda? \nMike Pence is there to save the world from the Devil. That much we know. He is the new Jesus. Fine.\nJared wants to save his business from ruin. That is clear. He has proven himself to be an ordinary extortionist with Qatar and god knows who else. Mob material with the appearance of an angel sent directly from the heavens so the simple people will believe he is great.\nIvanka wants to make money of her own to get away from her father. She tried her hand in trinkets. Well, that is fine, of course. \nBut what are the agenda's of the people supporting Trump? People like Bannon, Cohen, Mercer, Icahn? Money in one's own pocket is an obvious one. But is there something else, too, that we don't get to see?",
    "Why is nobody on the streets protesting? An ice-cold assessment of the players and billionaires behind them points at a continuation of dominance of confidence tricksters, grifters and assorted chaos mongers populating the Senate and possibly the House, too, after the November 2018 elections. Because the DNC has proven to be even more corrupt than the RNC, I do not see how this can be solved in a two-party system where the DNC and the RNC are the only players.",
    "Rudy knows he's lying he's just trying to get Mueller to tip his hand.  Rudy is lying through his teeth. just can't make it on your retirement and social security eh Rudy?",
    "Does the (house) GOP care if Trump is Putin's doll/if US policy is for sale?  Why be afraid of Trump when Putin isn't?  As long as a Republican is in the WH they don't care if he might be a sell-out (Benedict Arnold)?  I didn't know my Facebook was a tool for the Russians- that's the kinda stuff I wanna know.  I wanna know what, if anything, Trump did.  I wanna know if he was a sell-out traitor.  Idk what's going on....but he's sure acting suspicious.",
    "under your constitution ONLY the house can bring impeachment charges, the senate \"prosecutes\" and is in charge of seeking justice but the house MUST start the process. i just looked up the info.",
    "Devin Nunes is a despicable human being and politician. His image will be stained with cowardice and the blood of democracy and decency. He will be looked at as symbolic embodiment of everything wrong with complicit Republicans and 45ths politics. He will be slammed as how not to behave  as a politician. He will be a small figure with few words attributed to him and they will all be somewhere along the lines of shameful.",
    "The grown ups of the Senate have spoken...and   omg...dont call it a comeback...haha...\nTrumps new obession...Senators...let me see...his next phone call...\"Daddy Putin, help me...the Senators are taking me on...can you pay them off too, please daddy?\"",
    "Rudy works on the idea that half truths if said often enough will be accepted as full truths. He is just as smart as trump (Not real smart) and has similar ethics."
