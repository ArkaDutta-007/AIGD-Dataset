    "I cannot believe how poor of a memory Americans have. They forgot why Trump was denied a second term by a landslide 7 million votes. Trump mishandled Covid-19, he failed to act on Covid soon enough and it resulted in a pandemic killing 600,000 Americans and destroyed the economy. There were 2.5 million jobs lost. Maybe if I asked Trump questions in debates people would see the failure trump is: Here are my questions:\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Trump if you are reelected will you promise to do a better job responding to a new virus? You were warned on Dec. 19th of a deathly virus escaping a lab in China while you were golfing and your only response was it was a democrat hoax and you did not do anything until Jan 13th 2020 when you put in a no fly order but 400,000 people already entered our cities from China from Dec. 19th to Jan 13th to infect the whole country.\r\n\r\n2. Mr. Trump when you ran for president in 2016 you said you would bring in the best to solve problems but you ended up firing over 50 of them. Will you, if reelected, make a better effort to bring in the best?\r\n\r\n3. Mr. Trump when Michael Cohen was released from prison he said he was releasing a tell all book so you ordered the DOJ to rescind the release and remanded him back to prison to stop the book release. If you are reelected president will you promise not to weaponize the DOJ to go after anyone you perceive to be a political enemy?\r\n\r\n4. Mr. president in 2020 you lost the election by 7 million votes and claimed the election was a fraud and stolen from you. Your team went to court with 59 cases but failed to show any fraud that would reverse the results of the election. If you lose in 2024 and you cannot find fraud will you again scream the election was stolen or will you respect the peoples vote and assist in a peaceful transition?\r\n\r\n5. Mr. Trump when you left the White House in Jan 2021 you took many boxes of top secret documents, and when the FBI asked you for their return you only gave them a portion of them and lied about having more. If reelected president will you follow the procedures for handling sensitive top secret documents?\r\n\r\n6. Mr. Trump, when Obama left office he warned you that Michael Flynn was a double agent working for Russia and Turkey, but you ignored that and hired Michael Flynn to head the NSA just to fire him two weeks later. If reelected will you promise to take the advice of prior presidents and not put double agents in charge of national security?\r\n\r\nDave Clark",

    "The country has a profound responsibility to reaffirm its unwavering commitment to the rule of law and demonstrate, without doubt, that the idealized vision of America is not just a distant dream but a reality it is determined to protect. To achieve this, it is crucial to ensure that justice is served fairly and unconditionally, especially in the case of individuals like Trump.\r\nBy holding Trump accountable through a just and impartial legal process, the nation would not only uphold justice in this particular instance but also send a strong message to deter similar occurrences in the future. This would demonstrate the country's firm stance against any violations of its laws and principles, regardless of a person's status or influence.\r\nThe significance of this effort cannot be understated, as it would reinforce public trust in the democratic institutions that form the foundation of the American ethos. Upholding the rule of law and safeguarding core values are vital for preserving the integrity of the nation and ensuring that its citizens and the international community can rely on America's commitment to fairness, justice, and equality.\r\nTherefore, it is incumbent upon the country to embrace this opportunity to reassert its dedication to the rule of law and make a resolute stand against any transgressions. By doing so, the nation will not only strengthen its own democratic fabric but also inspire the world with the enduring power of justice, integrity, and the American spirit.",

Let's keep up the good work. =)\n\n\"Past examples of successful defeat of verification reversal by politicians have involved various methods, including:\r\n\r\nFact-checking and evidence-based rebuttals: Independent fact-checkers, journalists, and experts have played a crucial role in debunking false claims made by politicians. By providing verifiable evidence and presenting factual information, they can challenge and counteract deceptive tactics.\r\nExample: During the 2020 U.S. presidential election, numerous fact-checkers and media organizations extensively debunked false claims related to voter fraud, which helped to clarify misinformation and prevent its widespread acceptance.\r\n\r\nTransparency and disclosure: Demanding transparency and accountability from politicians can help defeat verification reversal. Requiring politicians to disclose their sources of information, provide evidence for their claims, and be transparent about their motives and biases can highlight potential deception and create public awareness.\r\nExample: In the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, investigative journalism, legal investigations, and demands for transparency exposed the deceptive actions of politicians involved in the scandal, leading to resignations, indictments, and significant consequences.\r\n\r\nIndependent investigations and inquiries: Independent investigations conducted by non-partisan bodies or commissions can uncover the truth and provide evidence-based findings, reducing the impact of verification reversal by politicians.\r\nExample: The 9/11 Commission Report in the United States, which conducted an independent investigation into the September 11th attacks, provided a comprehensive analysis of the events and debunked conspiracy theories, helping to counteract misinformation and deception.\r\n\r\nPublic engagement and awareness: Educating the public about critical thinking, media literacy, and the tactics used by politicians can empower individuals to question and verify information, reducing the effectiveness of verification reversal.\r\nExample: In various instances of political propaganda and disinformation campaigns, public awareness and vigilance, including grassroots movements, social media activism, and community mobilization, have helped to expose deceptive tactics and prevent the spread of misinformation.\r\n\r\nCollaboration and cross-validation: Collaborative efforts among different stakeholders, such as journalists, fact-checkers, experts, and the public, can enhance the verification of information and provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment.\r\nExample: The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) collaborated with journalists from around the world to uncover the Panama Papers scandal in 2016, which exposed widespread tax evasion and corruption by politicians and elites, using cross-validation of evidence and information to verify the claims made.\r\n\r\nOverall, defeating verification reversal by politicians often involves a combination of evidence-based rebuttals, transparency, independent investigations, public engagement, and collaboration among different stakeholders to uncover the truth, promote critical thinking, and hold politicians accountable for their deceptive tactics.\"",

    "Rachel, you're a bit behind the times, love. Transnistria broke away from Moldova in 1990. Putin is to the Russophile separatists behind the breakaway, what Trump is to MAGA. Ditto the separatists in the self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine's Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk, who have been trying to break away since 2014 in the wake of a popular uprising that kicked out a Kremlin puppet who sabotaged Ukraine's application for EU membership in favour of closer ties to Moscow. Meanwhile, Georgia's civil war with Abkhazia and South Ossetia first flared up in 1992. In 2008, it led to a Russian invasion and the short-lived Russo-Georgian War after a number of deliberate provocations by the South Ossetians.\n\nThe fact is that after the break up of the Soviet Union, majority ethnic Russian regions of the newly independent (or in most cases, once more independent) countries refused to accept that they were no longer Russian citizens. Putin, for his part, has always refused to accept the demise of the Soviet Union and wants to reconstitute it. Over the last quarter of a century, the two things have converged as Putin has supported the separatist movements to both keep the former Soviet republics in a state of instability and to provide him with a _casus belli._",

    "America\u2019s Image Abroad Rebounds With Transition From Trump to Biden : Pew Research Center \nThe election of Joe Biden as president has led to a dramatic shift in America\u2019s international image. Throughout Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, public's around the world held the United States in low regard, with most opposed to his foreign policies. This was especially true among key American allies and partners. Now, a new Pew Research Center survey of 16 public's finds a significant uptick in ratings for the U.S., with strong support for Biden and several of his major policy initiatives.\n\nDonald Trump ? Well  he's going to prison .",

Biden's mentality BECAUSE of his age, give the younger Trump a pass regardless of what he says or does is ignorant. News programs shouldn't highlight Biden's mentality, while saying practically nothing about Trump's mentality!!! It's obvious who has the sharpest brain!

    "A contested convention is a sign of the serious dissatisfaction of party members.  That dissatisfaction results in the inability of people to align behind a candidate and that causes the contested convention.  That dissatisfaction and inability to align behind a candidate results in people being unenthusiastic about voting, so they stay home and the party's candidate loses the election.  \nThere is a fair amount of misinformation in this.  There is also a fair amount of voter shaming.  \nI am a Bernie supporter.  In 2020, after the DNC put their hand on the scale for a second time, I switched my party affiliation to the Green Party in protest. I fully intended to vote for Howie Hawkins until Trump would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power during a Presidential Debate.  Then I relented because we could not allow Trump to stay in office regardless of how I felt.  \nThat said, Biden has been better than most people have given him credit for.  The Biden admin has forgiven several billion dollars of student debt for several million people.  While Biden stopped the railroad strike, his administration continued negotiations between the railroads and the unions and got many of the concessions for the unions.  Not to mention, Biden's department of labor has been fantastic for workers and unions.  The infrastructure bill, while not perfect has been great for the economy.  The biggest current problem has been in the middle east where a spoiled child has been abusing it's poor neighbor for generations and the spoiled child is unwilling to stop because they are used to their favored status that caused them to be spoiled.\nI appreciate the people that running in the Primary against Biden (not RFK Jr. though) but they were always going to lose.  Cenk Uyger is plainly ineligible though, the Constitution the same way a 20 year old is ineligible for office.  I like Marianne Williamson, but she lacks the job experience that Biden has.  Both of them running and the votes they get send Biden a message about what people want.  I will likely vote for Marianne Williamson to strengthen that message.  But in the general election I will vote for whoever has the best chance of beating Trump, even if the candidate that had the best chance was a unsliced loaf of bread.",

    "11:00 that entropy was the result of selfish motives united toward no common values when \"conservative\" was understood to \"conserve\" that sense of (moral) values (since Edmund Burke).  Then those same media respond to the entropy by seizing the left for the content of its \"message\" in order to profit from populism, not statecraft. \n\nConaider, for ezample how American media served the Saudi Royal Family's public relations-interests when the Crown Prince was designated as the King's spokesman when MAGA was fresh for the White House.  The interests were therefore global where MAGA implied a more provincial perspective--and see what happened to the Public Relations/Political factors when Khasshogi was murdered. The pattern doesn't repeat itself entirely; it evolves out of the back rooms into the uses (not the valuyes) of morality for Fox News (think Monica's dress not Stormy's  NDA)..\n\nThat pattern seems to explain for me why Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh may be disposable for those media interests. As the medium devolves into a completely reactionary approach to translating current events into professional journalism, the matter loses relation to the public in the nature of ordinary lives.  The pattern may well end where the global interests have excluded local problems from that \"programming\" in favor of reacting--not reasoning--=against the other party for power, lacking any opposite perspective about government.  The left failed to realize how long ago the right stopped listening in order to weave their \"narrative\" of politics in a way that absolves the wealthy of any responsibility for politics, then used nedua  to engage other factions by deceit, for whatever reason.  Just don't contradict a postulated need to defend tax shelters in a process of insisting on a military empire made of subcontract law, then budget federal authority for military authority, not police jurisdiction, so that states-rights grounds of argument are free to  distort  the  emergence of fascism through \"expert\" constitutional interpretations.\n\nPerhaps the current state of Conservative Media has reached the same crisis that brought Lenin his path to sovereign power by making the population forget that \"democracy\" means government by the majority, not merely by the mob.  There's a system that goes with the distinct values, which is nihilism for the motives toward anarchy, including the \"get the government off my back\" demand of most successful capitalists. They won't need the schools and roads as soon as they retire to  gated community, safe against the left (whatever that means lately).",

    "I don't get it, I had an older \"brother\" ever since I was born. He came out as trans when he was 40.....She seems much happier now, but it doesn't mean that she doesn't have to deal with idiots who somehow believe that how she identifies is all about them...Trust me, my former brother, now sister and I had a super difficult relationship and her identifying as a woman doesn't erase the many conflicts we had growing up, but she seems to be a lot happier now and I feel nothing but joy for her. I won't lie, it took a bit of time to adapt (I 100% support her, but just going from one name to another for someone you've known your entire life isn't easy), but at the end of the day, I wish her nothing but happiness and if I can wish that to a member of my family with whom I've had a very complicated relationship, I don't see why random strangers make it a point to go on a crusade against her or any other transgender individuals. She knew full well that she was going to have to endure hate coming from loved ones (fortunately that part didn't really happen) as well as complete strangers (unfortunately, that part keeps happening on a weekly basis). Just think about this, what do you have to gain from coming out as transgender if you know that a bunch of complete strangers are going to make a point of hating you? Doesn't it show how sincere transgender people are? What the f**k do they have to gain except finally feeling like they can be who they truly feel they are? Who are we to tell them \"Nah, you don't have the right to do that\"? Is it so hard to imagine that someone feels like they identify more with a different gender than the one they were biologically assigned at birth? How is it suppose to affect my life or yours? Can't we let people just take the decisions they want to take and do the best they can to be happy? I'm not saying \"I get it\", I'm not trans, I don't feel the way a transgender person feels......I'm also not an accountant, I don't see why someone would choose to be an accountant, I'm not a cop, I'm not a painter, I'm not a vegan, I hope to be a father someday but I am not one yet......My point is, we all are different, why can't we let each other do whatever it is we have to do to be happy? Why do so many of us insist on telling other people what they should and shouldn't do? As long as it's not hurting anyone else, what's the problem? How are transgender people hurting other people?",

    "If given the choice of Biden vs. Trump, I will be forced to vote for Biden.  Am I happy about this?  Absolutely not.  Where are the primaries?  Where is the choice?  I witness signs of dementia in both Trump and Biden.  Biden is head and shoulders above Trump in knowledge and intelligence, but that does not seem to be a characteristic important to half of American voters.  America's elections are more like beauty pageants than serious political discourse, and worsens by the year.  Stupidity is no longer a source of shame, but a point of pride among America's bottom third of the population.  The DNC leadership is jeopardizing the return of Donald J Trump in a rematch that never should have happened.  Trump's cult will never be swayed, combined with the votes of thoughtful conservatives, the balance is terrifyingly close. Unless all voters are invigorated, especially minorities, and get out to vote, seriously handicapped by Republican chicanery, the return of Trump will result in a civil war.  Once the US falls, Putin will take at least eastern Europe and China will make a play for Taiwan while simutaneously making the Yuan as the global standard of currency.  We are at a crucial crux in history where our real problems are the coming disaster of global climatic change, the rise of Putin's reign of terror, and something that the news agencies are not giving the degree of urgency on China's export ban on rare earth elements.  This will cripple America's high tech industry for ten years as we gear up our own capabilities.  How this National Security issue has gone on for so long is frightening.  If Taiwan falls, 90% of IC chip production that runs every aspect of modern technology, including our defense systems, will become unaccessible.  China's dominance in high tech is part of a long term plan to neutralize a very volitile US in world matters, once our capacities are nullified, then world finance will fall under Beijing's firm grip.

    "It's frustrating that mental health institutions are not given the importance they deserve. The Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 (MHSA) was signed by President Jimmy Carter to provide grants to community mental health centers. However, in 1981, President Ronald Reagan reduced funding for mental institutions, repealing most of the act. This was a significant setback for mental healthcare policy.\n\nThe closure of state psychiatric hospitals has led to an increase in incarceration of people with mental illness. In the event of a mental health crisis, peace officers often respond to the 911 call instead of a therapist, social worker, or psychiatrist. But most officers aren't trained to handle mental health emergencies, and while laws protect civil liberties, it's challenging to hospitalize people against their will. As a result, policing and incarceration have replaced emergency mental health care. Currently, nearly half of the people in U.S. jails and over a third of those in U.S. prisons have been diagnosed with a mental illness, compared to about a fifth in the general population.\n\nThe justice system's intervention in mental health care has often resulted in fatalities. According to statistics, almost one-quarter of fatal police shootings involve people with mental illness. Mental health care in jails or prisons is usually inadequate or abusive. Jails and prisons have now become the new asylums.\n\nThe transfer of mentally disabled people from psychiatric hospitals back to their families or community in the 1950s is responsible for the deinstitutionalization movement. The closure of hospitals resulted in patients being discharged without appropriate psychiatric care. Consequently, people in need of care were left to roam the streets and live among the general public. \n\nCommon sense suggests that if more community mental-health hospitals were built, there would be fewer mentally ill individuals on the streets and living amongst the general population.",

Ginni Thomas, the wife of Clarence Thomas, walked by me. Frank Gaffney, you know, the kind of foreign policy hawk who inspired Donald Trump\u2019s Muslim ban brushed shoulders and sat sat nearby. And I was surrounded by basically the vast right-wing conspiracy, about 300 people settling into their chairs to hear Nikki Haley speak at noon.\nThey hold these meetings three times a year, in secrecy. The location of the meeting is not told to anyone who isn\u2019t a member of the group. The membership rolls aren\u2019t provided outside of the membership\u2019s inner circle.

    "if only they had the same outrage when 20 school children were torn to pieces with a GUN.....but yea,   we have to deal with all the dangerous trans people...no doubt after they sort thew whole Toilet outrage which has completely disappeared",
    "His lies and deception are breathtaking. And let's not blame the media. The media has been reporting on Trump's lies and deception for years, even uncovering past lies and deception that go back decades. Fundamentalist Evangelicals held their nose and voted the pathological liar into office. Santos's well documented lies and deception and piled on top of more lies and deception haven't moved the needle an inch in terms of his accountability. The end justifies the means.The media does its job, and the new norm of lies and deception piled onto more lies and deception continues, because it is politically expedient for all the lies and deception to be overlooked, and otherwise excused and rationalized by a political party that should know better, but refuses to act. If we ever wondered why our schools are often the undisciplined hellzapoppin messes many have become ... it's because so many of the adults are missing in action ... missing in action, gaining political power by looking the other way, and never disciplining those whose egregious lies and deceptions got them into office, and whose very presence and votes they stand to benefit politically. Farce has become the new norm. Cheap, transparent, unaccountable, old-boys-club farce. The party of law and order is a hypocritical mess of expedience and cowardice ... The new norm ... and all the reporting by the media hasn't changed the outcome. it is simply recording the pathetic history of the new norm.",
    "Hey RePUGNANTcans yall realize one day you will no longer be and all LGBTQ community will still be in these streets, I can bet there are children or family members of yours that wanna come out and the continued rhetoric weighs on them",
    "All the trans adults you see today did make it without any help as children. We all suffer for it... those of us who are still around, that is. It brings me to tears to see what Machaela Cavanaugh has done. She didn't even have skin in the game. So many random people are willing to hurt trans kids. It's wonderful to see one pure ally stand up. It's also so sad that it's so few.",
    "You don't have to agree. But Republicans are not interested in protecting ANY children....cis or LGBTQ. If they cared, they would vote for expanded Medicaid, childcare, taxing the rich, free school lunches, holding banks accountable, funding for FDA to enforce safety regulations for baby formula, etc.",
    "Republicans despise America \u2014 look at what they are trying to do; ban the teaching of Black history, subvert tenets of American democracy, they are against the rules-based international order, finally they don\u2019t believe in the peaceful transfer of power from one duly elected administration to the next.",

    "Trump also wanted to shut down our giant military base in Germany and bring every service member home . The largest American military base located right there in central Europe .\nAnd as usual he announced it on Twitter before ever talking to his Chiefs of Staff ?! Also redirecting an American military aircraft to land at a fledgling little civilian airport in a little town in Scotland to give it business because it's the closest airport to one of his golf clubs . The crew has to be transported to his golf resort to stay overnight because The civilian airport didn't have the fuel needed for an American military plane and it had to be purchased at an outrageous price and trucked in , while the crew ( dressed in military fatigues ) at first felt underdressed while they partake d in 5 star dining , full cocktail lounge , and 5 star hotel rooms , All courtesy of the American tax payer . Trump is good with other people's money , Especially when he's using it to purchase unconditional loyalty and to further finance his business interest by keeping a civilian airport open near his resort .?! Nothing nefarious happened to the military aircraft while it was parked overnight on the civilian airport b/c no-one would expect it to happen ( the first time ! ) .\nThis is just a couple of dozens and dozens of examples that should be talked about . But Joe Scarborough is loud and he talks a lot And rambles on to where  many people will lose their train of thought or what they wanted to add . At least I would like to think that I'm not the only person remembering this !"
