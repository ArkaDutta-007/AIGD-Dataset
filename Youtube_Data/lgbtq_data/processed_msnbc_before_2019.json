She describes her own experience so honestly, ,agree or N O T, I still enjoy her candor and her view. And Ari\nyou are so talented and present in what you do. Bravo to you both.",
    "Making money off of being a brand / just existing is not the paradigm of feminism. It is, however, very Trumpian. I actually don't have any issues with the Kardashians being successful, but conflating vapid financial success with feminist heroism is odd. It's the same logic that conflates Trump's financial success as being a powerful leader. This mindset is destructive.",

I don't like certain people...equally\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  Not because anyone made me feel a certain way-I needed to take responsibility for my own thoughts, feelings, actions/inactions.

You want us to wear hand bags and pray to Mohamed. You want us to get sterilized so we can act more women.

    "Excellent interview with an extremely talented, influential, and brave filmmaker. I think her passion for the Kardashians contradicts/undermines her other very valid insights into feminism, but we're all a tangle of contradictions where our ideas and emotions cross wires. I think Soloway's interview was a bit sabotaged by a clickbait title focusing on the Kardshians who she likely is empathetically drawn to since their family shares a transgender struggle like her own did, and I'd encourage viewers not to get hung up on the \"Kardashian feminist hero\" opinion as it's really not what the bulk of her interview was about.",

I worked at a plastic surgery center and most of the young women wanted to look like one of the Kardashians.  The staff encouraged it.  I am a feminist, but, I don\u2019t believe that requires me to support all women.  I support woman that are successful, outspoken and confident, regardless of their views, career, sexual preference and looks.  However, I draw the line at personally supporting narcissists and people that don\u2019t believe in equality, whether they are a man or woman.  We all have a right to like or not like who we want, but calling the Kardashians heroes and slamming women that don\u2019t support all woman ruined the interview for me.",

    "TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR VOTE\n\nNext month (November 2018) the American voter has a unique opportunity to stop all the hate, vitriol, and violence, that has been incited by the Democratic party, which in of itself is nothing new.  They have had hate and violence as their Democratic calling card for years. We can all search through the various videos that demonstrate these facts. And many Americans (of both parties) become in-broiled in this drama because of frustration and anger. They simply do not know how to stop this tearing down of the American life. There is a way to do this. One must realize that there is only one entity that has the most power in any election. That entity is YOU! There are WAY TOO MANY corrupt Congressmen and women, and members of the House of Representatives. We can IMPOSE our own TERM LIMITS upon them by simply not voting for any incumbent (currently in office). When the same corrupt people are elected over and over again, the same corruption, colluding and conspiring continues and grows more violent.  TAKE BACK YOUR VOTES AMERICA and let's restore correctness and righteousness back into our government - one vote at a time if need be - one election at a time if need be. \n\nSurely Lincoln must have had the Democrats in mind when he wrote:\n\n\"The people of these United States are the rightful masters of both Congress and courts. Not to overthrow the constitution. But to overthrow the men [and women] who pervert the constitution.\" - Abraham Lincoln\n\n\nTAKE CONTROL OF YOUR VOTES ! THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE !",

But msnbc somehow ignores those failures ( among others) and makes claims like . \"People will lose their insurance because of the changes being suggested\" Thing is even before the suggested changes there were millions of Americans without health care, Obama care made the system worse and is/was  a precursor to the government controlled healthcare (single payer) and single payer plan is BAD NEWS. msnbc seems to ignore the details. msnbc even ignores the Constitution (electoral college) and msnbc and idiots on the programming make idiotic claims that Trump is an illegal president ( nothing could be further from the truth.)Recall \"You can keep your doctor \" \"you can keep your healthcare\" comments obama made which were 100% lies to the American people...lies that cost  Americans outrageous health premiums, this entire obama care mess is 100% the fault of democrats, who infact ALL voted for the debacle known as AHCA. msnbc conveniently ignores who screwed things up in the first place.  (the democrats). msnbc conveniently ignored the cause of the financial crisis when the business real estate sector (in part) was damaged) WHY.. because it was Barney Frank and Bill Clinton that created the affordable home act that allowed (forced) banks) to loan to people who could never otherwise pay back the loans for homes, those loans caused a rush on home sales, inflated prices, then when the market busted (as was predicted) all those people were damaged and chased out of their homes  all courtesy of democrats and their faulty minded programs--msnbc conveniently avoided putting the blame where due on the democrats, and instead twisted the issue to blame republicans for the problems, and they msnbc are doing exactly the same thing now.(Obama care is great and the big bad republicans are cheating the little guy again)  that is utter nonsense and utter BS.The list is long as to the clear hypocrisy of democrats, like chuck schumer,elizabeth warren,maxine waters,nancy pelosi, and almost all of the hollywood freak show supported by freaks like harvey  (nut case) weinstein the ever popular two face sexist common  (as we now see) amongst democrats...did I mention Anthony Weiner.",

Maddow should be the first to call for his resignation or impeachment. A sweet dream would be to see Trump engage Maddow directly. No he doesn't have the guts nor the ability.",

There are too many men who used to be women that are better suited to the military than some of the men.  Trump doesn't want them in there, but is pointing to Maddog as the reason.  He has the power to override anyone on what he signs.  Women are in the armed forces, men are as well..why not take the trans and let them serve. If you are a man from birth or woman from birth but don't feel comfortable around a trans person...You don't need to be in the military..you are too fragile and easily offended! While we're on the subject, I've seen the videos where they let the women go lighter on the physical aspects of bootcamp..THAT'S A COP OUT..if you are  a woman and you can't do all the physical crawling, climbing and jumping that is expected of the men...YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE MILITARY..what's next? people in wheelchairs rolling across the fields with guns in formation? It's not discrimination, it's common sense to have only the most able in the military.  That's why you can't enter past a certain age..Do we want 80 year olds out there to avert age discrimination?

As we all know, Lady Gaga educated everyone in her Tweet that 45% of transgender people are already suicidal. People with psychological disorders, such as wanting to commit suicide, cannot join the military. How are we going to put someone who is suicidal in a high stress environment and expect them to hold up? We cant!!!\n\nThe military cannot make exceptions for anyone. They cannot conform to one individual's needs. It is about the group in order to survive. Someone with asthma is rejected from serving in the military because of the special needs that need to be met. How is it that someone with asthma, that is not controlled the the individual, can be refused because of the special needs but, someone who wants to alter their bodies can't be refused? Nobody is forcing the individual to surgically alter their bodies, only the individual is. \n\nStop living off of feelings and start living on reality. Our military need strong minded and bodied people, not people with problems, including asthma, missing limbs, or psychological problems such as people with suicidal thoughts.",

And let's be honest, you can wear all of the lip stick and dresses you want but it's still a man. Vice versa for the males. You're not even allowed to walk side by side one female and one male. How should that play out? Our military should be focusing on whatever dangerous situation they're in. Not on the \"female\" soldier with a full beard because \"she\" is in combat and no access to needed steroid treatment. Which by the way the military (AKA tax payers) will have to pay for.

Also the reason he blocked them is because transgender people were able to get hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery free from tax payers money. And many people did not want tax money going to things like that. Now as far as Trump misrepresentation of his policies towards the LGBT community I think people are right to be angry because he did say he was going to be on their side.

It's nuts to think a cisgender person knows what life is like as a transgender person. Ideally we should be able to come together to discuss these things and come to a solution best suited to both cisgender and transgender people. Which to be clear does not mean anyone has right over another, more privilege than another nor give permission for people to be ignorant. It does mean equity since we aren't equal.

I am not buying it - I was in DC on Saturday hoping to promote equal human rights for every person - Instead what I encountered were large groups of people marching against hate, using anger and hate as the primary platforms to have their voices heard. The level of hypocrisy I encountered was astounding. For the few short hours I could stand to be in the presence of such ignorance I saw several physical and verbal assaults by \"peaceful protesters\" against those who were exercising their own freedom to protest the rally. It was just so heartbreaking, for what was supposed to be a beautiful demonstration, to witness such radical and criminal behavior in which the \"peaceful protesters\" were apparently marching against. And to cap it all off - The speech Madonna delivered... She should be in prison. There is no way to take what she said about her thoughts of blowing up the White House out of context. She should be banned from Washington DC for the rest of her life - She honestly deserves worse like possibe stripping of her citizenship, deportation without an avenue to ever come back. It's just absolutely disgusting and despicble that you can start off a speech by saying you want to start a revolution based on love and then use vulgar language and express terrorist thoughts in the name of love?

He will somehow try to get as much fame and fortune out of this. He is nor running for the elections or the ppl but for his rally's, coz he lives for the applaus and these ppls admaration. Trump is a narcisist and he's vain. He's not a stupid man, but he does live in his own reality and puts ppl in a category, stereotype every group.

I think someone needs to stand up against the teaching to kill all gays like it clearly states in the Qur'an and the Hadith. Link: \n\nhttps://wikiislam.net/wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Homosexuality",
    "Trump and the republican party do not understand (which is unlikely) that by using the term Radical Islamic Terrorism, they are insulting the peaceful Muslim people. They do not have the same set of values as the Western world. Saying this term is insulting to them in every single way, which inflames the situation. It is imperative that the Western civilizations break the cycle of violence with the Muslim peoples, which has existed for many centuries. So it is imperative that we are more sensitive when addressing them,; their culture is different than ours in many ways, so we must be smart in order not to offend them. The GOP and especially Trump do the precise opposite; they cause so much damage. Anyone intelligent can easily understand why they do this: they have no interest in making peace with the Muslims peoples, they want to continue the war in the Middle East by any means necessary, so they advertise ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism so much so that, if they again get to the White House, the people will be so scared and misinformed that they have no choice but to agree that America should again invade and attack and make war in the Middle East. They are indeed a great bunch of warmongers and fearmongers, with exceptions, of course.\nMoreover, Radical Islamic Terrorism is ridiculous terminology because the problem is not Radical Islamic Terrorism, it is Terrorism. Many terrorists do not embrace Islam, the religion of Muslim peoples, and many are not Muslim at all. Many terrorists embrace the insane ideology because they are also insane. Plus, we all know if you want to be good at a specific subject, you go for the most powerful entity in that subject. In terrorism, terrorists go for the most powerful terrorist group out there, which is ISIS. \nThe pattern is mental health, the main factor of terrorism. People who want to kill other people are completely insane; in other words, they have a serious mental health problem. The other thing not to forget is not to give So Much free advertising to ISIS. Not giving them this advertising can cause a lot of damage to ISIS, so this is Very Important. There should be a balance between correctly informing the people and not advertising them.",

Of course there with be consequences for a religion when followers are massacring people in the name of that religion.  There is so much in the media about the minority rights of Muslims in America, what about the minority rights (for Christians, gays etc) in Muslim majority countries?  Another topic that is just too difficult for MSNBC, CNN etc.  The simplistic scripted narrative of America is bad and America is responsible for all of the world's ills, just doesn't stand up to even a cursory examination.",

Read Quran and study ALLAHS WAYS and Muhammad and his History! WEST IS DECEIVED - MUHAMMAD SLAUGHTERED CHRISTIANS AND JEWS WITH HIS CALIPHAS and many PAGAN ARABS in Medina when HE GOT POWER of soldiers and weapon! Before he became a warlord, muhammad was peaceful, and that peacefulness is what western muslims like Obama and  your friends believe in - but since Al Quran is not chronological like The Bible - You can take verses from what you like because the context is very different. in the first chapters of ISLAMS MUSLIM QURAN muhammad is quite peaceful, but once he make a deal with medina and goes back to kill his tribe and the pagans in Meccah, ISLAM TURNS FOR THE TRUTH - WHICH IS TO SLAUGHTER ALL WHO DO NOT ACCEPT muhammad as a prophet, and that ALLAH is GOD - all will be slaughtered!!! it doesnt matter how much western muslims try to paint Islam. Under islamic rule in the times before the west became technological - muslims had christians and jews living in the land either paying Jizya(which is being an outcast in the society in muslim land) or convert to Islam. those who believed in freedom and democracy were either slaughtered or ran away from Meccah. and to this day no christians, jews or pagan are allowed into Meccah because REAL muslims HATE THEM. you westernized muslims and liberal will know this soon once they kill you for the hypocrites you ARE. yes  - that is why ISIS kills muslims like christians, beheadings - because AL Quran surat at tawbah 9:73-5 let muslims kill hypocrite muslims - thats why Islam and ISIS goes hand in hand - once ISLAM has power and money, weapons and mujahideens - they will fight the secular islam government rule and single the land out for a caliphate! only we who KNOW ISLAM know the TRUTH - you need to real al Quran with eyes open..",

He had no history of involvement with any radical organization, a fact demonstrated by the FBI's own investigation of him after one of his loony rants got reported.

He was violent to his ex-wife; he was prone to wild mood swings; he would rant and rave about Jews, blacks, women, gays, etc to co-workers.

    "some guy on a cbs news wrote this. It is food for thought.    Muslims, like the imam in Florida, are trying to deflect what is clearly an Islam problem - the violent-cult-of-Islam problem. His pseudo-apology and empty words are not backed up by reality. Name one Muslim country in the world where minority rights are respected. In Qatar, yesterday, the Dutch woman who was raped was jailed and was actually fined \u2013 for being raped! Where are the apologies or cries to reform the system from the Muslim world?? The Imam in Florida was apologetic because Muslims are currently a minority - period. Do you really think this man gives a hoot what happens to non-Muslims - let alone LGBT?? Not a chance!\n\nListen, I know how Muslims operate. I grew up in India and have seen first-hand how the cancer spreads. First, they will move into a neighborhood and act nice and apologetic - that is as long as they are the minority. As the population of Muslims increases the demands for unreasonable rights also become shrill - the right to slaughter animals in plain sight, the use of loudspeakers to blare their prayers, sharpie laws, illegal construction - the list is long. The occupied areas soon become no-go zones for non-Muslims. Dearborn, MI is a good example of how the encroachment happens.  Countries that have been transformed using this invasive method are many - Brunei, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Maldives, Comoros, much of Africa are some.\n\nThe only practical solution to this disease is to ban this cult in regions of the world where Muslims are not in control - no matter how antithetical it may be to our values - after all, Nazism is banned nearly universally, massive overhaul of the immigration policy, and economic isolation for starters. If that does not work then a very violent uprising around the world against Muslims is inevitable.\n\"",

I thought to myself and contacted the Dr. whatsapp number he gave me <># +1(909)3755642 he told me about his herbal medicine and how it works that I only have to use it for 2 weeks. But I have doubts at first because it sounds too good to be truth I just heard a voice in my head after praying that night advising me to purchase his medicine. I paid him the price and gave him my address, three days later there was a delivery man knocking on my door I was happy when he told me it was from Dr. Kanayo. To cut the long story short I used it just as he instructed before going for a new test this time my result was showing Negative twice my doctor was so amaze because the virus was no where to be found, I just broke down in tears and started thanking God and Dr. Kanayo for curing me and ever since I had promised him I will keep sharing my testimony with the public because everyone deserves a chance to be cured. I never really like taking the ARV drugs I am sooo glad I don't have to take it anymore tho \ud83d\ude02 .....",

I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s extremely naive.  \nI remember being as young as 3 years old (& throughout my early childhood) that I was a girl.  Not just any girl,  but a girlie girl.  I loved barbies, pink, makeup, dresses, thought I was a princess and was extremely feminine.  I was an only child raised by my father with very little exposure to women.  My dad was a manly man, dressing me boyish, keeping my hair short.  It almost seemed like he wanted a boy and it was confusing to me as a little girl.  Nobody tried making me feminine but that\u2019s what I loved,  feminine things.  God made me a girl and I knew it without any female influence.  \nI personally can see some boys being made this way,  and evidence shows that it\u2019s our chemical composition, the types of chromosomes we are born with that dictates these natural desires.  \nI remember having crushes on boys in kindergarten which is surprising considering how over protective my dad was.  As I got older I use to lie and say I don\u2019t like boys just to keep my dad happy.  My father had such distrust in boys that I honestly believe he would have preferred me to be a lesbian rather than straight.  But that\u2019s not how I identify myself.  I personally don\u2019t think we have much of a choice on how we identify ourselves,  we do however have a choice on how to act on our desires.",

I don\u2019t care if you did sweat in PE class.  \nA great way to get rid of the bathroom issue is to install bathrooms that allow total privacy (the ones that allow just one person).",

Both of these circumstances do not avail him of his Christian call to treat all in an aire of love however.  Demeaning others is not giving an aire of love.  Granted, his faith says implicitly that homosexuality is an abomination, further his faith says that homosexuals will not inherit the kingdom of God.  These directives are not any reason to demean anyone I say again.  The Bible doesn't say that we must like everyone on the contrary, everyone is given their own free will yet we are called to love one another.  If I were him I would pay the debt owed the city.  I would fight to keep the building and then in an aire of love I would discus in earnest with the elders the possibility of letting homeless, specifically homeless gays, the occasional use of our facility with Christian stipulations.  God, specifically Jesus the Christ, doesn't hate gays, Christ loves all.  Fact of the matter the God inspired scriptures says that homosexuality is a sin, but in spite of our sin which christ and God hates, he still has a passionate love for us.

And Trans men that have beards and look just like cis men will be forced into the restroom where women are. Think of the dad waiting for his daughter to come out of the restroom at a WalMart in small town USA, and his little girl comes out immediately followed by someone who looks, sounds, and IS a man. That being the Trans man. That puts the Trans man at an extreme risk of being assaulted. These laws are not protecting cis gendered folks, they are only harming the Trans community.

In other words, none of them necessarily heard his rant.  Now, I remember the weekend of JFK's assassination vividly and I know that while Jack Ruby killed Lee Harvey Oswald on the same weekend, he did not kill Oswald _before_ JFK was shot.  In fact, had he done so, the conspiracy theories would have been quite different, wouldn't they?  I don't like it when a reporter who draws the right conclusion -- these three candidates didn't disavow support from this guy and his followers -- does so in a misleading way.

Could you please list them?  If this is the first, why did neither you nor your staff vet this pastor?  Suppose by \"religious freedom\" he was referring to Wiccans?

When you have endorsers in your rally literally asking for open borders and staff members who are literal radical communists while saying things like white people dont know poverty or putting not rich vs upper class against each other while using a disdain tone implying all rich people (not millionares) got where they are by being awful people and using their money for themselfs is bad (he does not specify abiut who is talking to) or that not rich people who dont support you because of any of the other previous things are dumb or brainwashed or they are also brainwashed because they dont support a specific social plan because they feel comfortable with what they have and want their money to be used for things they find more important in their particular lifes, when you do all of that and want to improve social services while also allowing perpetual welfare leechers or ilegals to enjoy its benefits at a cost of a drop on its quality by still allowing Sanctuary cities to exist and literal Ice abolishers to talk for him, WHEN you do all of that..you dont have a good chance of winning the public, you become literally the option against the people you want to help and your own worse social propaganda disaster.\nAnd if most Bernie supporters were not like that, where is the outrage of the majority against those things? ,where is the outrage for the lack of will of Bernie to call them out ?or even better where is the will ro raise a candidate who does not do any of that. Can you imagine if Trump did the equivalent, tribal mentalities just dont work, I wish he could make a voluntarly cheap health care system or make companies pay a little more in fair taxes but Trump literally does not have to do anything to have a better image Bernie is his worst PR disaster. And even if he wins, the elite still wins.",

Even more if Trump did not call it out, why does Bernie gets a pass I dont know. People thinking that a Washington overly rich elite politician with propaganda help of the corporate media elitewho has three mansions is the ultimate change against the elites and corruption is just too naive and deep in the propaganda holes. BERNIE just as any politician IS THE ELITE as well,and even if he thinks he is not he is still playing thanks to and only to the extent of what the elite allows to create the ilusiom of choice, and to think he truly thinks he thinks he can achieve a \"political revolution\" is just too naive in my opinion, no politician believes that, he just as the rest just uses the speech to be in the debate theater and allow people to think they won, dont believe other big corporate and political figures of other parties dont talk to each other they do and you are not playing to create a different game, we are all playing by the rules, you dont drain a swamp with a swamp, you only choose the less messy of the two.",

Dont mean to sound pesimistic but we are all pawns in the game and regardless of who is in charge the \"political revolution of those who are against the elite\"is just fantasy,  Bernie I live in my three mansions while preaching I get the working class Sanders is now exeption, same as Trump. People who accuse others of acting all fanatic and religious about a person while acting the same and as if they were literal change is just naive and dumb, no politician is change they are just employees of the corporate and political elite and they dance as long as they are allowed to and they being perfectly aware of that , awara that they are just puppers and people need to be aware of that, they are just the same side of the same coin under the boot of Washington lobbyists and the ultra rich, they get money and move under certain speeched just to make people happy and think they are doing a revolution every single time. Its just annoying when speacially Bernie supporters get the moral superior tone of the people even when you just point this out, same as anyone does it. There is no swamp to drain they are all the swamp. Thay being said I dont mean democracy shouod go or that they cant affect things to the extent of the power they have even if its just to give people the ilusion of power but the \"change\" and \"revolution\" against corruption and elites\" is just naive,every political system allows them one way or the other regardless of how uncorrupt or outside of the game of the elite game you think Trump or Bernie are, they are not.",

Yeah, people can change, they can change their minds, that's definitely a good thing, but there's something very important to be said for that rare person who's always been ahead of the curve, on the right side of history, often at great risk (see Bernie), as compared to people who are always behind the curve, always on the wrong side of history, and who only come around after it's safe to do so, which smacks of opportunism (see Hillary, see Biden, see Harris, ad infinitum).",
    "This is well worth sharing now in 2019. As Sanders says in the video, \"We live in a tough world and leadership counts.\" He showed it again in 2016, forcing progressive issues into national political discourse, the only national politician in the past four decades to successfully do so.\n\nLeadership, integrity, and the right agenda are the reasons I support Sen.

History has shown that he was on the right side of controversial issues over and over and over again.  Others have come around and NOW agree that DOMA was bad, that invading Afghanistan and Iraq was wrong, that fracking is bad, etc., etc., etc.  But Bernie had the good judgement and core passion and strength of A TRUE LEADER.",
    "This clip and interview is relevant once again - it is important for people to realize how Bernie has been on the right side of history on issue after issue, WAY before those issues became popular, or even acceptable. Just like his \"out there\" progressive ideas in the election campaign in 2015-16 were scorned back then, and now in 2019 we have candidates trying to align themselves with Bernies ideas - some doing it genuinely, some just having to pretend to support those ideas, to have a hope of winning the candidacy. \n\nHow about this radical idea - how about making Bernie Sanders the democratic candidate? He's been a trailblazer all his career, and he tirelessly fights for what is right, always seeming, in hindsight, to have been right on issues where he was in the minority, when those issues were fought over. Make the sensible, obvious choice America, do yourselves and the world a favor, and vote Bernie for President. That way you can say that you too were, at least this time, on the right side of history.",

Biden can't even apologize for wrongdoing!! Yet the most well known outlets- certainly the majority of MSNBC hosts- keep shoving him down our throat. Washington Post and other print media couldn't be more obviously against Bernie.\n\nIt is critical that we have a strong progressive candidate for the general election. Bernie's consistency gives him an edge over Elizabeth Warren, imo but it's a close call. I'd be ecstatic about either.

    "One of the many reasons it is important to know Sanders was always right and first, when compared to Clinton, is that it was a true act of courage to make the principled stand when most were taking the easy way out.  To dismiss that courage of conviction and claim they are the same now is insulting to everyone. It diminishes his courage and and allows Clinton to co-opt it. As if she also has that courage of conviction. She does not! \n\nAnd one of the things I like most about Sanders is that he would not call himself courageous and would downplay this argument made for him. He is far too humble for such things. The way he sees it, he was just doing what was right and instead of praising him for it, he would like you to shame the other people into evolution. Because at the end of the day we can only get where we should be if the majority of people want it. And he would rather people wanted it.",

    "I held a high-level clearance for about 14 years\u2026 above Top-Secret. The first thing about clearances that I was taught was that it was my, and every other cleared person\u2019s, responsibility to recognize information of a sensitive nature and take steps to protect it should it not already be classified. That meant realizing that it was sensitive and even though not \"labelled\" classified it needed to be and to do that by immediately moving it to a compartmented environment and treating it, by default, as if it was classified until it could be determined otherwise.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it is Top-Secret (TS), Secret(S), Confidential(C), For-Official-Use-Only (FOUO), it is all \u201cclassified\u201d and cannot be in the public domain. Her server is the public domain and for her to hide behind \u201cI never sent or received email that was labelled classified,\u201d is just ludicrous. As the originator of these emails, it would be her duty to declare, and treat them as classified. You would be amazed at what qualifies as \u2018Confidential\u2019 and things like confirming that she, as Secretary of State, might be having dinner at a particular restaurant on a particular date or time would most certainly rise to the level of Secret because knowing that information might give our enemies the opportunity to place assets that could compromise her position. When considering classification you also have to consider context, especially time. Two weeks before the atom bombs were delivered to Tinian Island, their delivery date and location, and even their existence, would have been TS, a year after the war, perhaps Secret, now, Unclassified. Emails that might not rise to the definition of classified now, could have been at the time she sent them. Almost everything that comes out of the Secretary of State\u2019s mouth (other than asking Bill to pick-up some toilet paper on the way home) would be classified at some level.  Either that, or she was the most inept Secretary of State we ever had.  So far her own State Department states that they have found 22 emails classified TS or above. Can you imagine how many emails that are stilled classified but at a lower level there are? She has shrugged these off using the \u201cnot labelled when I sent or received\u201d defense. That doesn\u2019t mean that they weren\u2019t classified but only that she did not feel the need to protect this sensitive data and appropriately label them. Again, she comes off as either incompetent or untrustworthy. She as the originator or viewer had the legal responsibility to protect that information and if you or I did it, we would undergo felony arrest and prosecution for each and every infraction of the law. At a minimum, we would never again be trusted to hold a security clearance. At a maximum, would go to jail. I know someone that lost his clearance, was heavily fined, and spent two years in jail because he brought classified work home with him on the weekends. He wasn\u2019t a spy, but he was treated like one, because he failed to protect the secrets of his nation. Hillary has no scruples and considers herself above the law.",

And Patriarchy is simply defined by the philosophy of assuming the right to exact dominating power; however covert or overt, over another human being. I believe It is the full embracing of Patriarchy and it's value of domination that robs men and women of their ability to exact personal power of defining themselves, robs them of the courage to embrace the weight of the truth of their souls, robs them of the freedom to love themselves and others rightly and justly. Until we completely dismantle patriarchy in our personal, intimate and public lives, we will always struggle with the violence inflicted on our bodies,  the bodies of others globally and the body of our earth itself.",

During our days as colonies, all were required to pay not only taxes, but tithe and adhere to the religious laws of the Church of England. Mattered not what your personal religious beliefs were, tithe to the COE was required. Also, I did a bit of study, online, and located the oath of office for public officials in Kentucky, and Section 228 of the Constitution of the Commonweath of Kentucky  is the oath of office for public officials of Kentucky, and it reads, in part, \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that I will support the Constitution Of The United States, and the Constitution Of The Commonweath Of Kentucky\". That was written 1891. The only alteration was written in 1978, and did not change what I excised from the first document. How a person can swear to that oath, then claim the bible as their shield, even I think that is a bit of a moral stretch.",

    "I believe that Rick Santorum is incorrect, partially. If the Congress passes a law, and it is contested, the Supreme court can deem it \"unconstitutional\" and render it moot. But the Congress, theoretically, can overturn a Supreme Court decision, but not by itself. For example, here is an excerpt of an article I was recently reading: \n\n\n\"Drafting and passing a new law can be a time-consuming process, but it certainly takes less effort than amending the Constitution. A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate. If it passes this hurdle, the amendment is sent to the state legislatures. The amendment doesn't become an official part of the Constitution until 75 percent of the states approve it. Constitutional amendment isn't always necessary, however, to correct judicial interpretations that go against congressional intent. For example, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 after several Supreme Court decisions illustrated how prior civil rights laws didn't have as broad a scope as the legislature intended. The act negated as many as nine court opinions, including five decisions handed down just two years earlier.\"\n\n\nThis is how Congressional power can overturn a Supreme Court decision. However, this process has never been utilized in our nation's history.",

I resent the fact that she has turned this opportunity into a spectacle instead of having a constructive conversation.    We all know she is a lesbian and naturally she will be one-sided, but If she is going to purposely create confusion of what the message, thoughts and opinions are of her guest, THE CONVERSATION IS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE, and she should stay away from discussing such topics.

    "\"A Day in the Life of JOE Conservative Republican, the Libertarian\" -\u00a0\nJOE gets up at 6:00am to prepare his morning coffee. He fills his pot full of good clean drinking water because some big government Liberal fought for minimum water quality standards. He takes his daily medication with his first swallow of coffee. His medications are safe to take because some overly concerned Liberals fought to ensure their safety and that they work as advertised. All but $10.00 of his medications are paid for by his employers medical plan because some Liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance for their workers; now JOE gets that insurance too (this article was written before Reagan\u2019s reign).\n\nHe prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs this day. JOE\u2019s bacon is safe to eat because some regulation loving Liberal fought for laws to regulate safety practices and standards in the meat packing industry. JOE takes his morning shower and reaches for his shampoo; the bottle is properly labeled with every ingredient and the amount of its contents because some meddling Liberal fought for JOE's right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained.\nJOE dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some tree hugging Liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government subsidized ride to work; it saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees. You see, some Liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which allows everyone the opportunity to work and be a contributor which also made the economy more productive for, everyone\u2019s benefit.\nJOE begins his work day; he has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation (this article written before Reagan's reign) because some greedy Liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. JOE\u2019s employer pays these standards because JOE\u2019s employer doesn\u2019t want his employees to unionize, or leave to go work at a union shop. If JOE is accidentally hurt on the job or becomes unemployed by no fault of his own, he\u2019ll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some Liberals didn\u2019t think that he should fall behind and lose his home because of his temporary misfortune.\n\nIts noon time, JOE needs to make a Bank Deposit so he can pay some bills. JOE\u2019s deposit is federally insured by the FDIC because some silly Liberal wanted to protect JOE\u2019s money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system (article was written before Bush Jr's reign). JOE has to pay his Fannie Mae underwritten Mortgage and his below market federal student loan (article was written before Reagan's reign) because some stupid Liberal decided that JOE and the rest of America would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his life-time.\u00a0\n\nJOE is home from work, he plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive to dad's; his car is among the safest in the world because some greedy Liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. He was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers Home Administration which was started by some socialist Liberal when bankers didn\u2019t want to make rural loans. The house didn\u2019t have any electricity until some big government Liberals stuck their nose where it didn\u2019t belong and demanded rural electrification (Those rural Conservative\u2019s would still be sitting in the dark).\n\nHe is happy to see his dad who is now retired. His dad lives on Social Security and his union pension because some socialist Liberal wanted to make sure JOE\u2019s dad could take care of himself, so JOE wouldn\u2019t have to. \u00a0After his visit with dad, JOE gets back in his car for the ride home. \u00a0JOE turns on a Conservative radio talk show, the corporate sponsored host keeps saying that \"Liberals are Bad, and Conservatives are Good\" (of course, the host doesn\u2019t tell JOE that his beloved Conservatives have fought against every protection and benefit that JOE and his family have enjoyed every day). \u00a0JOE smugly agrees, \"We don\u2019t need those democratic socialist big government Liberals ruining our lives; after all, I\u2019m a self made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have\".\nHooray Bernie Sanders!!!! \u00a0We Support YOU Bernie!",

    "I believed at the time, and continue to believe, that Obergefell was correctly decided, but on the wrong legal grounds.  In order to fashion a majority, the Court based its decision on equal treatment -- to deny homosexuals the right to marry is to deny them equal protection under the law.  But the better argument is that the right to marry, which is part of the right of privacy, is among those multitudinous rights reserved to the people under the Ninth Amendment, as Justice Goldberg argued in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965).  \n\nIn his famous dissent, Chief Justice Roberts argued, correctly, that if the right to marry extends to homosexuals, it must by the same logic also extend to polygamous partners.  He seemed to think that prospect irrational.  But under the Ninth Amendment, the right to marry would extend to both homosexual and plural marriages, without the need for equal protection analysis -- for that right is among those reserved to the people, and therefore inviolable.",
    "And how long before the supreme court makes all marriages equal?  Why are gays afforded special privilege while the polyamorous and the bigamists are not?  How long before a grown man may not marry his grown daughter because of the disgusting judgements of a shaming society?  Why can not two heterosexual, life-long bachelors join in marriage to enjoy the benefits that a married couple enjoy under the law?  We are not talking about equality folks...we're talking about supremacy for the haters and the prejudice.  We're talking about the monsters who believe that a marriage is between two people alone and not more...or that those married couples can't be related or underage according to our prejudices.  Why can a prophet marry a 6 year old while I can't?  Love is love.  Why can't a loving group of 5 people all marry one another in equality...for their love is so great that they can all love one another equally?  Where is the equality in denying that?

    "Connecticut State agencies & AFSCME commit \"Fraud on the Court' because they do not fear the law. It is common everyday practice to deceive a Judge in the CONSTITUTION STATE. Look up \"Corruption Connecticut Style.\"\n\n\"Fraud On The Court By An Officer Of The Court\"\nAnd \"Disqualification Of Judges, State and Federal\"\n1. Who is an \"officer of the court\"?\u00a0\n2. What is \"fraud on the court\"?\u00a0\n3. What effect does an act of \"fraud upon the court\" have upon the court proceeding?\u00a0\n4. What causes the \"Disqualification of Judges?\"\n\n1. Who is an \"officer of the court?\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A judge is an officer of the court, as well as are all attorneys. A state judge is a state judicial officer, paid by the State to act impartially and lawfully. A federal judge is a federal judicial officer, paid by the federal government to act impartially and lawfully. State and federal attorneys fall into the same general category and must meet the same requirements. A judge is not the court. People v. Zajic, 88 Ill.App.3d 477, 410 N.E.2d 626 (1980).\n\n2. What is \"fraud on the court\"?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Whenever any officer of the court commits fraud during a proceeding in the court, he/she is engaged in \"fraud upon the court\". In Bulloch v. United States, 763 F.2d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir. 1985), the court stated \"Fraud upon the court is fraud which is directed to the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements or perjury. ... It is where the court or a member is corrupted or influenced or influence is attempted or where the judge has not performed his judicial function --- thus where the impartial functions of the court have been directly corrupted.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Fraud upon the court\" has been defined by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to \"embrace that species of fraud which does, or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery can not perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.\" Kenner v. C.I.R., 387 F.3d 689 (1968); 7 Moore's Federal Practice, 2d ed., p. 512, \u00c2\u00b6 60.23. The 7th Circuit further stated \"a decision produced by fraud upon the court is not in essence a decision at all, and never becomes final.\"\n\n3. What effect does an act of \"fraud upon the court\" have upon the court proceeding?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Fraud upon the court\" makes void the orders and judgments of that court.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is also clear and well-settled Illinois law that any attempt to commit \"fraud upon the court\" vitiates the entire proceeding. The People of the State of Illinois v. Fred E. Sterling, 357 Ill. 354; 192 N.E. 229 (1934) (\"The maxim that fraud vitiates every transaction into which it enters applies to judgments as well as to contracts and other transactions.\"); Allen F. Moore v. Stanley F. Sievers, 336 Ill. 316; 168 N.E. 259 (1929) (\"The maxim that fraud vitiates every transaction into which it enters ...\"); In re Village of Willowbrook, 37 Ill.App.2d 393 (1962) (\"It is axiomatic that fraud vitiates everything.\"); Dunham v. Dunham, 57 Ill.App. 475 (1894), affirmed 162 Ill. 589 (1896); Skelly Oil Co. v. Universal Oil Products Co., 338 Ill.App. 79, 86 N.E.2d 875, 883-4 (1949); Thomas Stasel v. The American Home Security Corporation, 362 Ill. 350; 199 N.E. 798 (1935).\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Under Illinois and Federal law, when any officer of the court has committed \"fraud upon the court\", the orders and judgment of that court are void, of no legal force or effect.\n\n4. What causes the \"Disqualification of Judges?\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Federal law requires the automatic disqualification of a Federal judge under certain circumstances.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \"Disqualification is required if an objective observer would entertain reasonable questions about the judge's impartiality. If a judge's attitude or state of mind leads a detached observer to conclude that a fair and impartial hearing is unlikely, the judge must be disqualified.\" [Emphasis added]. Liteky v. U.S., 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1162 (1994).\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Courts have repeatedly held that positive proof of the partiality of a judge is not a requirement, only the appearance of partiality. Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 108 S.Ct. 2194 (1988) (what matters is not the reality of bias or prejudice but its appearance); United States v. Balistrieri, 779 F.2d 1191 (7th Cir. 1985) (Section 455(a) \"is directed against the appearance of partiality, whether or not the judge is actually biased.\") (\"Section 455(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7455(a), is not intended to protect litigants from actual bias in their judge but rather to promote public confidence in the impartiality of the judicial process.\").\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That Court also stated that Section 455(a) \"requires a judge to recuse himself in any proceeding in which her impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" Taylor v. O'Grady, 888 F.2d 1189 (7th Cir. 1989). In Pfizer Inc. v. Lord, 456 F.2d 532 (8th Cir. 1972), the Court stated that \"It is important that the litigant not only actually receive justice, but that he believes that he has received justice.\"\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Supreme Court has ruled and has reaffirmed the principle that \"justice must satisfy the appearance of justice\", Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 80 S.Ct. 1038 (1960), citing Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11, 14, 75 S.Ct. 11, 13 (1954). A judge receiving a bribe from an interested party over which he is presiding, does not give the appearance of justice.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Recusal under Section 455 is self-executing; a party need not file affidavits in support of recusal and the judge is obligated to recuse herself sua sponte under the stated circumstances.\" Taylor v. O'Grady, 888 F.2d 1189 (7th Cir. 1989).\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Further, the judge has a legal duty to disqualify himself even if there is no motion asking for his disqualification. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals further stated that \"We think that this language [455(a)] imposes a duty on the judge to act sua sponte, even if no motion or affidavit is filed.\" Balistrieri, at 1202.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Judges do not have discretion not to disqualify themselves. By law, they are bound to follow the law. Should a judge not disqualify himself as required by law, then the judge has given another example of his \"appearance of partiality\" which, possibly, further disqualifies the judge. Should another judge not accept the disqualification of the judge, then the second judge has evidenced an \"appearance of partiality\" and has possibly disqualified himself/herself. None of the orders issued by any judge who has been disqualified by law would appear to be valid. It would appear that they are void as a matter of law, and are of no legal force or effect.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Should a judge not disqualify himself, then the judge is violation of the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. United States v. Sciuto, 521 F.2d 842, 845 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"The right to a tribunal free from bias or prejudice is based, not on section 144, but on the Due Process Clause.\").\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Should a judge issue any order after he has been disqualified by law, and if the party has been denied of any of his / her property, then the judge may have been engaged in the Federal Crime of \"interference with interstate commerce\". The judge has acted in the judge's personal capacity and not in the judge's judicial capacity. It has been said that this judge, acting in this manner, has no more lawful authority than someone's next-door neighbor (provided that he is not a judge). However some judges may not follow the law.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you were a non-represented litigant, and should the court not follow the law as to non-represented litigants, then the judge has expressed an \"appearance of partiality\" and, under the law, it would seem that he/she has disqualified him/herself.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 However, since not all judges keep up to date in the law, and since not all judges follow the law, it is possible that a judge may not know the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court and the other courts on this subject. Notice that it states \"disqualification is required\" and that a judge \"must be disqualified\" under certain circumstances.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Supreme Court has also held that if a judge wars against the Constitution, or if he acts without jurisdiction, he has engaged in treason to the Constitution. If a judge acts after he has been automatically disqualified by law, then he is acting without jurisdiction, and that suggest that he is then engaging in criminal acts of treason, and may be engaged in extortion and the interference with interstate commerce.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Courts have repeatedly ruled that judges have no immunity for their criminal acts. Since both treason and the interference with interstate commerce are criminal acts, no judge has immunity to engage in such acts.",

    "New discoveries are being made about the connection between the timing of puberty and illnesses later in\u00a0 life. given that one of the ways to deal with transgender children is to delay puberty we need to really examine what this means with current recent research that early or late puberty's can cause problems with metabolic disease in adulthood and perhaps even be related to an early death. When we are dealing with young children they can't make decisions based on facts like this, its up to the adults to give guidance . Wearing a dress or putting on makeup or having your hair short and playing with cars shouldn't mean an sterilization and a possible early death sentence. This is controversial I realize but parents should be aware of all the facts to make the right decision for their child. This generation of children who are changing gender so young are in essence being experimented upon with hormones and blockers and the results may not be know 50 years from now, when there parents and the Dr's who helped make that\u00a0 decision may not even be here to see the final results. I've had some tell me to \"Keep Quite\". but I believe in truth, it shall set you free. Ask your doctor have they read the new research and does it have any possible side effects by delaying puberty on longevity\u00a0 to see at least if they have read the research. or Google it yourself. I know many parents that are searching these youtube videos for answers, When faced with questions from children knowing about these options through the internet.

Keep in mind that someone who is trans isn't just cross dressing, they are in transition from one gender to the other, which means they're probably taking hormones, and what happens when a male takes female hormones or to a female when they take male hormones? They change. So...you're saying they should use the bathroom of the gender they are born?

And for both the ignorant men and ladies, what happens if this person completed their transition-meaning gender reassignment surgery? Hmm? Folks, you've probably been using public bathrooms with trans people and never noticed. Never even thought about it until it was brought up in the media. Nine times outta ten, a transgendered person will look like the gender they identify as and the only way youd know their birth gender is to either ask (which youd never do) or look at their privates (which is sick and perverted).

She used all for publicity and trying to sell her crappy book.

I am a human rights advocate and will do my best to help get this message out to the public, and to see it changed in AJ's memory!\nAJ will still make a difference in this world, even though he is on the other side currently.

    "I address this comment not to the author, but to those who are watching.\n\nIn the book of Acts chapter 5 (new testament), God struck two Christians dead in the church named Ananais and Sapphira for claiming to have given more money to the church than they had.  God can, does, and is right to actively punish Christians who are blatantly and intentionally in sin, even unto death.\n\nSecondly, God is so offended by sexual perversion, including homosexuality, that he destroyed two entire cities famous for it (Sodom and Gomorrah, Genesis chapter 19).\n\nFinally, gender is not a construct, or flexible.  God made us male and female (Genesis 5:2), forbade crossdressing (Deuteronomy 22:5),\nand has given different roles to men and women in the church in the new testament (1 Corinthians 11:4-12, Ephesians 5:22-33, 1 Corinthians 14:34-35, 1 Timothy 11-15).  Those passages cover gender specific commands in the new testament for clothing, speaking, leadership, and marriage.\n\nThis is the truth of God\u2019s commands.  And to those who say it is better to compromise and say you believe in God and preach heresy, I give you Revelation 3:15-16\n\n15\u00a0I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! 16\u00a0So, because you are lukewarm\u2014neither hot nor cold\u2014I am about to spit you out of my mouth.",

So in answer to the question what is a woman? If you are speaking of the body we all know the answer. But the body is only one third of a human being. \n\nThe mind is more powerful than the body as it controls the body and causes it to act.\n\nThe spirit or soul is the life of the body and the mind. Jesus tells us when we go to heaven we neither marry or are given in marriage. So the soul is neither a woman or a man. \n\nTherefore, though it is rare, a body of one gender can have the mind of the opposite gender. And which is more powerful? The answer is the mind. The mind is what causes a body to transition.\n\nSo what is a woman? Or what is a man? The answer is the mind of the human being. Is it male or is it female?",

It is a thorn in your side meant to drive you to the Lord  (2 Corinthians: 7-10). The ailment that Paul had was given to him to keep him humble. \n\nIn summary, you were born a man, but allowed to struggle with doubts and fears that it was a mistake to drive you to the Lord. All you've done is replaced the incorruptible One with the image of man (Romans 1:23) by giving into your struggle and feeding it. \n\nAlso, to say you're not broken is to deny sin and it's affect on the world - Romans 8:20-22. It's also another way of calling God a liar; if he formed you in the womb (Psalms 139:13), than saying you're not broken for desiring to be a woman is to say he didn't form you correctly in the womb and He made a mistake (negating Psalms 139:13) . That means what you heard say your not broken could still be lying to you, if God is a liar. How do you know you made the right choice?\n\nI'm sorry you chose the path of someone who listens to teachers who suit your passion and have become, in like manner, one who only teaches what people want to hear and believe in lieu of the truth (2 Timothy 4:3-4).",

    "This is reverse discrimination. Would a straight person be allowed to participate in the gay games, or would they have to keep their straightness in the closet and pretend to be gay? Why can't there be straight games? Small business owners can't even turn down the business of a gay couple if they don't want to participate in their gayness, but these gay people get their own games, their own parade, their own laws. WTF??? If I don't want to make a penis cake for a gay bachelor party, I'm not gonna. If I don't want to take photographs of a gay couple slobbering all over each other when it is announced, you're now husband and husband, I'm not gonna. If I don't want a party on my property, with a group of people gaying it all up, I'm not gonna. Go ahead Obama, fine me. I'm not getting your Obamacare either. If you like your doctor, you can't keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can't keep your plan. If you like your straightness, you can't keep your straightness. And I am giving fair warning...anyone who feels the need to post a comment bitching, attempting to point out the error of my ways, trying to convince me I'm wrong, or prejudice, I will post back. It will be rude, derogatory, and offensive. So, if you're gonna run away crying about how mean I am, I suggest you resist the post.",

    "What is wrong with y'all? So much hatred and apathy in the comments. If you can be compassionate then just keep your mouth shut. No need to spray your vitriol everywhere.",
    "NJ is right across the pond, booboos. NYC is for people who work, not people who beg. You can't make it here, buh-bye. Go live in Arkansas or Texas, same thing out there. They just want to be here so that they can beg for attention and clickbaits. Pathetic.",

    "What a hero! Coming out the world and proclaiming what kind of sex you prefer or what genitals you have!\n\nLaura Jane coming out as a transgender might be more heroic than Martin Luther King Jr., it is a close call though.",
    "As long as her singing \u00a0voice doesn't change too much, I coouldn't care less. whatever makes her happy.",
    "Seeing Against Me! live before and after Laura coming out has been an amazing difference to watch in her face and performance. \u00a0She is liberated. \u00a0There were so many lyrics previously to her coming out that hinted at it and the pain involved, and seeing her sing these same lyrics with a smile on her face and shaking her hips, proud to not bottle it in anymore was really moving. \u00a0Thanks Laura for doing this publicly for so many that need somewhere to look, and congrats on finally doing it for yourself. \u00a0I will continue to be there in the crowd every time you come to LA - from a long time fan with every piece of vinyl you've ever put out (minus the botched crasshole EP that I will never afford).",
    "You are the best example for others who are going through the same thing...very brave/courageous!\u00a0 You've got to be comfortable in your own skin to have any happiness in life, so I'm glad you made the decision to do this and very publically.\u00a0\nAnd your smile is awesome in your videos...amazing song in this video too."
