    "I live in New Mexico and know that it has been thoroughly Democratic for 95% of its political history.  It became a state in 1912 and, except for four or five Congresses, has been dominated by Democrats.  One year when the Republicans gained control of the legislature, they voted in a Democratic speaker anyway, who knows why!\n\nI have tried to vote only once but wanted to be an independent not associated with any political party.  I didn't understand that I would therefore be denied any voting except for the final general election.  I also didn't understand that the ballot would present only certain candidates and I did not have the opportunity to write in anyone else.  The Democrats have had a stranglehold on New Mexico for over 100 years.  Most New Mexicans are too apathetic to vote, so the incumbents are almost always re-instated until they voluntarily retire.  I am guilty, too, because my one sortie into politics was so unsatisfactory that I have not tried again.\n\nI must disagree with the thought that unity equals boredom.  When James Monroe ran for his 2nd term, he had no opposition because the old Federalist party had been disbanded.  His term of office is known as the \"era of good feelings\" because there was not this political tension politicians like to have.  Citizens could relax because they understood they were not going to be jerked this way and that.  So, the politicians spun up contention and stress again just to keep things interesting.  I, myself, could to with a little boredom and quietude in Washington, DC.  It's difficult to plan your life if you don't know what the next administration is going to do beyond it being something crazy.\n\nI guess the idea is you cannot have a ball game without two opposing teams, but I've had quite enough of this warring between political parties.",

According to the National Catholic Reporter, he is a donor, consultant, or board member for countless prominent Catholic organizations, including the Knights of Columbus, the Knights of Malta, the Busch School of Business at The Catholic University of America, the Napa Legal Institute, and many more.\r\n\r\nBy building his influence within these institutions, Leo has expanded his reach and built his credibility with the justices and Catholic lawmakers he needs to undermine democracy.\r\n\r\nAs our friend, investigative journalist and author Katherine Stewart, has written: \"Leo's primary conviction is that democracy will not deliver the kind of conservative values-based government that he believes America must have. He is therefore committed to building an oligarchy of the religious and the wealthy.\"\r\n\r\nIf the bishops can show their commitment to democracy and judicial ethics by cutting financial ties with Leo, it will send a powerful message to other Catholic and religious institutions across the country.\r\n\r\nThanks for everything you do to love your neighbor.\r\n\r\nIn peace,\r\n- Karli, Rev.

    "Repent Repent the day of the Lord is at hand! If you have not received salvation from Jesus Christ you will spend all eternity  (trillions and trillions) of years in hell. There will be everlasting torment for you and everyone you know who doesn\u2019t know the Lord. Repent today cry out for mercy! A man must be born again to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\nIn the bible Jesus said a man must be born again to go to Heaven. A lot of people think this means they should merely believe in him. We see so often in our world today and abrupt end to people's lives. And it becomes increasingly clear that when we die nothing else matters aside from our relationship with Jesus Christ. That is the reality of God's creation whether we like it or not. He is the creator and we are merely his creation. Here to live on his terms and happily at that. John 3:16 Says for God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever would believe on him would not perish but have everlasting life. But John 2: 23 says Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. 24But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, 25And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. One must square how one verse says to believe and be saved. And one verse says he did not commit himself to everyone who believes. It's crucial to think of these things because they are Heaven and hell issues. He said if you\u2019re not willing to come after me you\u2019re not worthy of me. And if you don\u2019t take up your cross to follow me you\u2019re not worthy of me. Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it but whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it. 2 Timothy 2:25 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 23But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. 24And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, 25In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 26And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.",

He didn\u2019t do very well tonight at all. \n\nThere were several moments where Joe pitched softballs that Trump, had he been sharp, a good debator, or a clear thinker, should have knocked out of the park, but he didn\u2019t. Just one case in point to prove my point. \n\nBiden brought up yet again the point that the reason he decided to run for President was because he heard Trump\u2019s comments about Charlottesville where he said, \u201cThere were good people on both sides.\u201d \n\nTrump\u2019s reply was paltry, and it could have been a slam dunk reply, like this:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy you brought this up. What I would like everyone who thinks Joe is right about what I said about Charlottesville to search for my FULL comments on that day. If you do, you\u2019ll find that my comments about good people on both sides did NOT include the white supremacists, and I unequivocally disavowed them and said I was not including them as the \u201cgood people\u201d. Go look it up. \n\n\u201cWhat the truth of that moment should tell you is that the media distorted my words, editing them in a dishonest way to convince you I was saying something horrible. This is a deceptive practice of all proponents of propaganda. \n\n\u201cNow, once you see the truth about that you will have another question to ask. \u2018When Biden says that my comments about Charlottesville were why he is running, does he know that I unequivocally disavowed the white supremacists in my comments? Because either he knows what I said and is lying and spreading the dishonest account just like the lying media OR he doesn\u2019t know because he doesn\u2019t look into things beyond the cursory amount that he wants to believe, which is something we can all do from time to time, but is totally unacceptable for someone who is running the country. \n\n\u201cSo, which is it Joe? Did you know I disavowed the white supremacists that day, or did you not? Are you a liar or just incompetent? Do you believe the nonsense people tell you without thinking and repeat it without question? Cause then you\u2019re just a puppet. Or do you just truly have no idea what is going on, like you seem to be showing tonight? In which case I feel sorry for you, but there is  nobody who should be voting for you.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s inability to do that makes me worried that he isn\u2019t smart enough to be President either.

    "Going to Heaven is easy!\n\nFirst, you must realize that you have sinned against God and need to be forgiven and saved from hell if you haven\u2019t been already. To be saved from hell and forgiven of all sin, believe that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, died on the cross for your sins, was buried, and rose again (1 Cor 15:1-4). When you believe that Christ\u2019s atoning work paid for all your sins and when you make Jesus your only hope of going to Heaven, you are forgiven of all sin by God and forever saved from hell; once you are forgiven, you are always forgiven. Warning: None of our good deeds can get us into Heaven. If we trust in our own works to get us to Heaven instead of Christ\u2019s atonement, we will not be allowed in. The Bible says \u201cNot by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost\u201d (Titus 3:5). In conclusion, just believe that all your sins are paid for by Jesus\u2019 atoning work and make Christ your only hope of going to Heaven apart from your good deeds.\n\n\u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9",

    "Treason is what Biden and his administration is doing with or border. Plain and simple and he's now giving aid and comfort to China, Iran and others which is also treason. Which is at the top of the list for the worst crime a public official can commit based on our constitution. And our constitution does not say we the people have to wait 4 years until the next election. Which is what it'll be by the time Biden is removed from office. The constitution is very clear about the process of holding a treasonous government official accountable. And those who either refuse to follow our constitution and their oath, or just plain do nothing ,but have either evidence of treason has been committed or knowledge, and do not uphold their constitutional obligation, are guilty of Misprison of Treason, which can carry the same sentence and punishment ad treason itself. So that makes every single government employee and official possibly guilty of the latter. But definitely the DOJ, Congress, Senate, the administration, Homeland Security, FBI,and many more for doing nothing but allowing more acts of treason to be committed. And if people would not only read their constitution but also take in exactly what is contained within it , and do the same with The Bill Of Rights. And The Declaration of Independence, they'd very quickly come to realize just how much of our government and all the branches and agencies are corrupt and committing criminal acts against the American people. Which is also an act of treason to commit crimes against the American people. And maybe then more people would speak up and call or write your congressmen and woman and senators and other representatives and demand they do their job we the people oay them to do. Or let them know they will also be held accountable when the American people decide we will uphold our constitutional duty, not.a right but the constitution clearly says it us our duty to take back control of our government when or if it becomes tyrannical and taking us in a direction we do not approve of nor do we want, and remove any or all from all forms of government and dismantle the entire government and rebuild it as was given to us. Then all who ate remives are to be put through a tribunal and if found guilty held accountable. It also clearly states the process when they do not uphold their oath of office, which as I undersradn is grounds for immediate removal and put on tribunal and if found guilty appropriate sentence or punishment is to be handed down alond with that they xan never hold any public office ever again in any forn of public office from local to state to federal. And there's not a single person who can say out government officials have followed their oath of office not one. And just to be clear read our visionary documents our founding fathers left us to guide us in keeping and protecting our Republic, not our democracy which we do not and never did have a democracy. And you'll all see for yourselves that it also gives an example of a treasonous act, and what Biden and his administration our doing on our border is the one the constitution uses as an example. And if violating the oath of office is grounds for immediate removal then wouldn't it be totally ignorant to think let alone believe we would have to vote out a treasonous person or persons ? We are bei.f lied to by every member our government so far and those who appear to be telling the truth are leaving out the parts where they also are guilty if miprison of treason by allowing it to continue and mire acts to be committed. Read our constitution and bill of rights and declaration of independence and then stand together with all citizens and stop them from destroying our country and our lives and dont.firgwt Biden agreed to sign over our sovereignty to the WHO ,WEF ,NATO, and a few other private groups that our government and others just happen to be members of and we pay for them to conspire to overthrow our government and people and control us. Use your brain for something other than storing all the devisive rhetoric this administration had out out there, and think for yourself and realize they do not care about any of us regardless of party affiliation,  they are using us to devide and conquer us from within. And trust me and many others when we say rhey are closer than the November election, from fulfilling their agenda and completing their plans. If anyone doesn't believe me or believe they'll do it you'd better go on all the elites websites and look at their plans for us and the world and think how much of it they've already done to us and the world. WHO, WEF, United Nations, NATO, Paris climate Accord , and others go look for yourself.

Sperm concentration fell by 52.4 per cent. \u201cSperm count and other semen parameters have been plausibly associated with multiple environmental influences, including endocrine disrupting chemicals, pesticides, heat and lifestyle factors, including diet, stress, smoking and body-mass index,\u201d the paper said. \u201cTherefore, sperm count may sensitively reflect the impacts of the modern environment on male health throughout the life course.\u201d Chemicals linked to lowering sperm count include some used to make plastics more flexible and flame retardants used in furniture. \n   These can enter the food chain after they are taken in by plants or eaten by animals. A diet high in alcohol, caffeine, processed meat, soy and potatoes may also have an adverse effect on male fertility. Aside from the obvious implications for reproduction, the researchers said the declines were consistent with reported trends in testicular c@ncer, the number of children born with one or both te$ticle$ missing, the onset of male puberty and total testosterone levels. \u201cThe public health implications are even wider. Recent studies have shown that poor sperm count is associated with overall morbidity and mortality,\u201d they added. They called for urgent work to find out the reasons behind the decline, noting a few possible candidates.",

I call bs, we will pay big money for them, none of our ppl will be released or be in there and then Hamas will have more $$ to buy weapons but the government will say don\u2019t worry we got this.

    "It's unbelievable what President Biden and the ghouls that run this country right now. This is all part of their new ideology to support dysfunction in every American affair . The weaponization of our judicial system . Flooding our borders with millions upon millions of illegal aliens. The more I go on the more disgusting it is and now they've got to the point where now Joe Biden is praising terrorism.   Something's gotta give we can't let this continue at some point we're going to have to take our country back and all we can do is wait to see what happens on election Day. I just wish it was Ron DeSantis running for president. Instead of trump. I would feel a lot better. And more secure on the outcome. It seems like Trump will say what a great job this speaker of the House Johnson is doing such a great job he sure didn't over the weekend. Again I think this goes back to Donald Trump's very bad decision making on his choices of people's characters and abilities for example Christopher Wray.,,    Bill Barr? Let's just hope and pray Donald Trump gets a little better on is judge of character. I just can't believe how bad we took it in the shorts. With these last few bills that were all put together especially this money for Ukraine so you might as well flush down the toilet. And the speaker of the House inviting the government to spy on us without first getting approval or a warrant signed by a judge. The speaker of the House Johnson is a perfect Democrat. He lied to the people he's just another Uni party member . Who cannot be very bright if he thinks Russia wants to invade Europe arr take over the world. It kind of reminds me of the George w Bush.   Era in time. I think we've had enough and seen enough of that and the speaker Johnson. Vote well my fellow countrymen!!!!!  and I hope not there is going to be a war on the horizon in this country. My father was right when he predicted that just over 30 years ago. Let's pray not. Because it's going to be a.   YES.     a bloodbath!!!!!!",

Joe Biden is weak and won't go underground to hide. Joe Biden likes to go wild. If he dares to poke President Trump's hive, he will have to pay the price of being deposed. and go to jail",

    "*Paragraph 5 of 5.*    _Sperm counts have declined 60% in North American WASP Men! Could plastics be to blame? Yes!!!_ \u201cThe reality is I\u2019ve only looked at two chemicals, but we live in a cocktail of pollutants,\u201d he says. Last year, Levine and other scientists, public health officials and clinicians from around the world issued a statement calling on governments, the scientific and medical communities, and organizations to acknowledge the importance of male reproductive health, to allocate resources to study the issues and to implement policies that remove hazards and promote a safer environment. The plea did not draw as much attention to the problem of declining sperm counts as he had hoped. The most obvious concern of dropping sperm counts is infertility. Even with sperm counts in decline, most men retain their fertility potential, says Skakkeb\u00e6k. But birth rates have been declining in industrialized countries for decades, he says, and it\u2019s not clear that\u2019s entirely by choice. Recent studies suggest that 20-30% of young men today have sperm counts in a range that is associated with reduced fertility, says Skakkeb\u00e6k. *Some research suggests we may be reaching \u201ca tipping point\u201d where more couples will take longer to conceive or may need the help of assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), he says.* He points out that in Denmark, the number of couples seeking help for infertility has increased significantly since 2001. \u201cAlmost 10% of children are now born after assisted reproduction,\u201d he says. Current estimates are that 12-18% of couples have problems conceiving, but there isn\u2019t good data to show how that is changing over time. Most researchers view the declining population data in western countries as a worrisome trend, but there is nothing to link that specifically to sperm decline. There\u2019s also a worry that decreasing quantity and quality of sperm is a marker for worsening health in general says Levine. Research has linked problems with sperm to a higher risk of a number of serious health conditions, including c@ncer, diabetes and heart disease, as well as de@th. \u201cI do see an analogy to climate change in the sense that we have clear scientific signs of the problem \u2013 a very serious problem, which endangers humanity,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are not taking the needed steps to reverse it or even just to start to understand what is going on.\u201d",

America has specific laws protecting us from having fake people as candidates, and Trump left a visible paper trail of evidence.\n\nThe bigger problem for Trump is that his legal \"professionals\" only have one strategy. Scavenge around and find individuals who would not get any attention otherwise, not unless they repeat the mantra that there was no crime. All they ever do is turn that one crank. When the going gets tough, they just turn that crank faster and louder. Trump's minions can spin that handle right off the gears, but then they still have the same problem.

    "Especially given the scientific evidence that states healthy people need not have to take the shot or worry about as much as worrying about the flu.  Even so, if the Military announced a command to be vaccinated, based on the most authoritative evidence at the time.  It is not oppressive for a military to have a universal requirement all soldiers are expected to obey and carry out.  When the proper information was eventually made available, the Military, along with every other organization who were not idiots, changed their stance to taking the vaccine optional and, eventually, private.  Orders are orders. I imagine there are battlefield situations whereby someone is ordered to do something that will result in that person getting killed, so having unknown, probably not serious or long term, health risks (although I did get seriously sick after a booster, so it happens) wouldn't be enough to exempt you from obeying the order.\n\nHowever we've discovered that evidence is mostly false, and an authority  is probably criminally issuing restrictions and guidelines that are unnecessary.  These unnecessary and ineffective regulations have resulted in several impacts at local, state, and federal levels, and ALL the impacts have been hugely devastating at a national scope.  \n\nThe following impacts include some, but not all, of the following:  obviously, detrimental effects to the number and quality of military personnel due to concerns over the vaccine; pretty much bringing our economy to a standstill for two years, wreaking havoc the nation is still recovering from; and untold number of small and medium businesses that were forced to close and cease operations, generally permanently; a huge, untold number of layoffs from companies of all sizes due to the destroyed economy; setting an entire generation of students behind by two years of classroom education and socialization due to the inadequacies of teaching children, youth, and secondary education students remotely; massive increases in mentally related problems like depression, anxiety, addiction, domestic violence, boredom and nihilism. There seems to be no end of negatives which are the result of, and also the responsibility of, individuals and institutions the entire nation trusted.  And evidence is piling up that said individuals and institutions knew from the start that all of their most impactful guidelines and regulations were ineffective and unnecessary.\n\nThere are individuals and institutions that need to be held accountable, probably prosecuted and punished, for a most significant set of economic, social, medical, cultural, and military effects, effects that probably have been the worst our society has seen or will see, in our lives.\nThe unnecessary and ineffective actions we took, based upon the words of supposed professionals expert in the handling of Covid, and a pandemic in general, were criminal; criminal of the highest level, and of such widespread and devastating effects, even treasonous.",

Years ago when a person immigrated to a new nation there was a certain awe and respect for that nation. The immigrant was grateful , gracefully friendly & appreciative to be in the new country. Wanted to be integrated into his new nation.  Nowadays they act like they only emmigrated because they had to, not because they wanted to.   The natives in turn, after many years of trying to be welcoming are rather fed up and the attitude is \"if u don't like it, leave\" I tend to be one of those. Why are they all looking at  \"a gift horse in the mouth?\" Remember history. \" When in Rome, do as Romans do\"  I am quite content with the awareness that I will not be around to see the destruction of our world but I am aware that the 3rd world nations will be the cause of it.

    "How Human Nature Works\r\n\r\nHuman nature is the desire to receive, also called \u201cdesire to enjoy,\u201d and it functions by receiving what is beneficial to itself and rejecting what is harmful. Everything in our lives is built upon this calculation where we first try to distance ourselves from harm, and then seek how to draw ourselves closer to what is beneficial.\r\n\r\nHuman nature also includes a multilayering of systems that work simultaneously on still, vegetative, animate and human levels. One of those systems is our bodily one, which operates involuntarily. If our bodies are healthy, then they know what is good for them and draw that goodness to themselves. After the bodily system, there is the emotional system, which also functions relatively according to instinct. From the emotional system, we move to the mind, and from the mind to the intellect, and so on. That is, we have systems over systems that concurrently work on receiving what is beneficial and rejecting what is harmful.\r\n\r\nSuch is human nature and the essence of our lives. Our every desire, thought and action operates according to the calculation, \u201cHow can we receive what is most beneficial to us and reject what is harmful?\u201d",

    "Trump is absolutely right about the problem. The policies are a total mess under Biden not just because he is corrupt but because he isn't sentient. We have no idea who is actually making the policies. As long as Biden keeps claiming he is mentally capable, he is responsible for the things that happen in his fascist regime, but we all know he ain't the one making decisions. There are a number of people who are making those decisions. And it seems like those people have been bought off  by groups that have conflicting interests. For example, if some people have been bought by AIPAC and the others by Chynah and some others by defence contractors,  they are all going to keep mucking around in the middle east taking opposing steps or not do anything at all. This is why there is an utter paralysis on what to even do about basic things except bomb countries that have nothing to do with the war. This is why he has massacred 40 million people in Africa and FAILED to maintain the illegal NATO occupation. This is why he is bombing national armies fighting ISIS and why he has restarted drone strikes in Afghanistan. The chaos is the plan. Because countries in the region want to maintain some kind of stability. But Biden's only interest is fomenting any situation that will allow his corporate reich buddies to pillage resources. If its not a puppet government, then absolute anarchy will do just as well. That is why Chaos is the plan. And without anyone steering the ship, everyone gets to serve the purpose of the bribes as well. great for them, bad for America.\n\nBecause every country is looking at our foreign policy being up for auction. And while people like Xi are bidding for it, other countries realise they cannot trust a country whose alliance is on sale. Which is why we are bleeding allies faster than someone loses blood from a nicked femoral artery. Biden will go down. lets just hope he doesn't take all of America down with him.",

In this system, the ego makes us think and act without considering ourselves as parts of a whole system.\r\n\r\nProblems and crises proliferate in our world when our egoistic approach to life continues growing, coupled with us becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if we think and act for the benefit of the whole system, where we consider the benefit of others and nature in our every move, then we will enter into balance with nature.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach balance with nature, we will experience a major upgrade in life: from a life of increasing problems and crises, to a life of harmony and peace.",

Judge Engoron gave the figure of 18 million USD as evidence of the truth, it is a gag and accusation, there is only a Kangaroo Court without a certificate of the Real Estate Valuation Committee assessed by a bank. , the reason is that Judge Engoron does not need a jury, which shows that Judge Engoron's silence to impose a fine of 250 million USD has no legal basis, because it says that Trump declared borrowed assets bank debt but Trump paid interest on the bank loan and did not owe taxes, Liititia James brought a false lawsuit, political games hindered President Trump from running for election in 2024. How can the judge use a kangaroo court? 120 Million MAGA believes in the law of fair trial. The Judge uses the law of the jungle, which is only applied by communist dictatorship countries.

If Republicans claim that they support free speech then why condemn peaceful protests and why condemn legitimate criticisms of Israel war by claiming antisemitism? \r\n\r\nI have been uncomfortable with the term antisemitism because it seems to be thrown around to censor legitimate criticisms of Israel. It is really unfortunate that many Republicans and conservatives are cheering on for more censorship and protection of Israel from legitimate criticisms. Very very wrong moves by these Republicans and conservatives and I think that they would lose support for these inconsistencies. Freedom of speech and association are under attack in many places and the last thing I need are Republicans, conservatives, and Fox News abandoning their free speech concerns.

I feel that, going forward, if a Democrat wins the election, it'll be four more years of the same and, in the case of Michelle Obama (if she becomes the DEI-enabled President), it'll be another four years of the Obamas. So, despite the premise that a President can only serve two terms, Barack Obama will, if Michelle gets in for two terms, have been able to control the Presidency for 5 terms.

These corporations and the companies that engage in price gouging are independent entities over which the President has limited control. The President's role is to ensure accountability and bring these companies before Congress for scrutiny. However, the current dysfunctional state of the Republican side of Congress presents a challenge in holding these companies accountable for their actions.\n\nDespite these challenges, certain individuals continue to exploit the situation by blaming President Biden for corporate greed. It is important to note that these individuals often engage in excessive spending on Trump memorabilia, which raises questions about the true state of the economy. If they can afford such expenditures, it suggests that the economic situation may not be as dire as they claim, and they could prioritize taking care of their families' needs.",

    "THANK  you for at least giving a short abet incomplete history of adverse possession.  The term EJECTION is not included here and it was and should have been the legal hinge that prevented ANYONE from altering laws anywhere in the US to grant rights to criminals who break and enter a property and then use con artist tactics to gain what is not their legally.  What is also missing is there are actual court cases and laws that are now on the books in every state being used to aid criminal 'squatters\".  Those laws prevent police from acting.  They have been told squatters are considered tenant and THAT throws the matter from criminal breaking and entering to civil.     The micro example is a person who breaks and enter into a home or dwelling. The macro example is what is happening at the Rio Grande border with Mexico.  There is no difference at all!  I have been trying to figure out what is the best accurate term/label for those whom we once referred to as ILLEGAL ALIENS.  I think I have it.  INTERNATIONAL SQUATTER makes sense.  People illegally breaking in and claiming a right that should not exist.  The rights have been hijacked by criminals through the help of judges and lawmakers who perverted our legal system AND by default compromised and broke our public safety net.  I really want to know WHO did what when and where - what case was used, who were the attorneys, where did it happen?  And how did it spread to all 50 states?   We fought a war to free ourselves from England.  I would have thought adverse possession should have been a law that never made it on the books in the USA.  It runs counter to the legitimate US rights and liberties imo and by default can be used by criminal element.",

Warning: None of our good deeds can get us into Heaven. If we trust in our own works  to get us to Heaven instead of Christ\u2019s atonement, we will not be allowed in. The Bible says \u201cNot by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost\u201d (Titus 3:5).

They can't just concede the election to Trump, so they have to resort to drastic measures like importing illegal aliens by the millions to help tilt the scales a little.  This too, will backfire though.  When Donald Trump gets re-elected, one of the first things he'll probably do will be to start massive deportations.

Reason given for why will not charge Biden as they could not get a conviction against Biden for the classified docs case because Joe is an \"elderly man w/a poor memory\" incapable of committing a crime \"that requires a mental state of willfulness. It says he has cognitive issues & could not even remember when he was VP\" & forgot when his term ended. IMO the DOJ got a head's up that Biden had classified docs, & then fast tracked the Trump raid in collusion w/CNN to get that controversy out there, then waited awhile, then low & behold Biden's attorneys \"found\" documents. Need to drop the charges against President Trump, who had the right to possess classified info. Joe Biden as VP and Senator had absolutely NO right to take home classified.

    "Attacking the judiciary in a democracy is detrimental for several reasons:\n\n1. Undermines the Rule of Law\nRule of Law: Democracies are founded on the principle of the rule of law, where laws are applied equally to all individuals, including leaders. Attacking the judiciary undermines this principle by suggesting that judicial decisions can be disregarded or influenced by political pressures.\nConsistency and Predictability: A functioning judiciary ensures that laws are applied consistently and predictably. Undermining judicial authority can lead to arbitrary enforcement of laws, eroding public trust.\n\n2. Threatens Checks and Balances\nSeparation of Powers: Democracies rely on the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. Attacking the judiciary disrupts this balance, allowing for potential overreach by the executive or legislative branches.\nAccountability: Independent judiciaries hold other branches of government accountable. Without a robust judicial system, there is less oversight, increasing the risk of corruption and abuse of power.\n\n3. Erodes Judicial Independence\nImpartiality: Judges must be able to make decisions free from political pressure to ensure fair and impartial rulings. Attacks on the judiciary can intimidate judges, leading to biased or compromised decisions.\nConfidence in Justice: Public confidence in the justice system is crucial for its legitimacy. If people believe that the judiciary is subject to political influence, they may lose faith in its ability to deliver fair outcomes.\n\n4. Destabilizes Democratic Institutions\nInstitutional Integrity: Democratic institutions rely on mutual respect and adherence to established processes. Attacks on the judiciary can weaken institutional integrity, leading to instability and uncertainty.\nPublic Trust: Trust in democratic institutions, including the judiciary, is essential for a functioning democracy. Erosion of this trust can lead to disengagement, cynicism, and decreased civic participation.\n\n5. Encourages Authoritarianism\nCentralization of Power: Attacking the judiciary is a tactic often used by authoritarian leaders to centralize power and eliminate checks on their authority. This threatens democratic governance and individual freedoms.\nSuppression of Dissent: An independent judiciary is a safeguard against the suppression of dissent and protection of minority rights. Undermining it can lead to unchecked government actions and suppression of opposition.",

Cliques are friend groups that are joined by mutual hatred of others not the normal friendships based on mutual interests, helping, cooperation and friendship.\n Its easy to form a clique or gather others in a gang by pointing out differences and leading by hatred of others.\nScience has now found that while its more common to have two sexes, some people will be sexually different. \nThats because we start off developmentally as unsexed. \nAt the end of the first trimester in utero, the change occurs to create our distinct sexuality.  Genetic issues and pollutants like mercury take the switch that goes either boy OR girl and makes it go somewhere in between. \nLater development is like a hormonal ballet.\n Its disrupted by chemical pollutants that our body mistakes for the hormones that trigger those sexual developmental changes.\nDue to disruption of development, only the individual person can know what spectrum of sexuality they are.\n There has always been a spectrum of sexuality but its increased greatly now due to the great increase in sexuality disrupting pollutants. \n Instead of blaming and harassing those kids, attack coal burning and chemical industries that produce hormone disrupting chemicals like PFOAS, plastics,  phenols and more. They are your devil.\n Due to synnergistic effects of the combinations of the thousands of chemicals released in pollution that greatly increases potency when together, we now have \"Super Toxins\".\n PFOAS like Teflon combined with heavy metals and phenols combine to create super potent hormone disruptor super toxins.\nIgnorant isn't a protected class. People need to get over the fact that its a different new world and do some research.\n Stop bullying other people who are different and start fighting pollutants and the polluters that cause health issues by blocking and disrupting proper hormone levels.\n Do you also attack kids with diabetes? Thats caused by a change in body chemestry too! Some of the same toxins are involved.\n Its not normal to be a diabetic but we dont make a big deal about that difference do we? \nIm glad the adults made this kid uncomfortable. \nNow maybe he knows how it feels when you make others uncomfortable.\nAmerica is supposed to be a free country. That is because people fled places where people with axes and stakes decided things like \"THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO WORSHIP JESUS\". \nWe became a free country to protect citizens from small minded thinking and the state run bullying systems that enforced their one way thinking.\nWe are supposed to be free from people like this in a FREE COUNTRY LIKE AMERICA.",

But if you believe he is a patriotic politician then nothing he has said or done makes any sense.   The fact is that trump and Putin hijacked the GOP, radicalized it and has turned it against the country as a whole, not just democratic and liberals, but against everything about the USA including our military, legal system, freedoms, morality, everything.  And I dare any trump supporter to debate me on this, because it is very clear I am correct here.  \r\nAs such, trump must be beaten, repulsed and blocked from ever holding any office or power position in the US ever again, and republicans, please stop putting party above country and lies above sanity.

    "Biden did poorly at the debate, but I will vote for Joe Biden based on his past record and what he has accomplished while in office. When Trump was in office, his only accomplishment was passing tax cuts to the rich and corporations. Meanwhile, Biden has passed the American Rescue Plan, which helped America battle covid. He passed the infrastructure bill to repair our roads, waterways, bridges and railroads, and bring high speed internet to rural communities. The Republicans fought against this bill yet these same Republicans are now trying to take credit for it even though they voted against it. Biden brought unemployment down and created 13.2 million jobs since he came in office. Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which made health insurance plans more affordable, lowered drug costs by enabling Medicare to negotiate lower prices, and protected millions of people on the Affordable Care Act. Biden also signed the CHIPS and Science Act, gave funding to reduce greenhouse emissions, signed the Postal Service Reform Act to modernize and stabilize the U.S. Post Office, etc. etc. I could go on, but you get the gist of it. What has Trump done? All Trump knows to do is push lies and foster hate and intolerance. That is why I can\u2019t understand why people want to vote for him? He did nothing while in office that helped the average person\u2019s life. If re-elected, Trump has already said what his agenda will be. He will go after his political enemies, stifle free speech of the press, weaponize the DOJ to go after people he don\u2019t like, fire 50,000 civil service people and replace them with Trump loyalists, deport millions of immigrants, and use the military against Americans. You notice that Trump hasn\u2019t said a word about what he plans to do to make life better for Americans because it\u2019s all about Trump. Trump only cares about himself and no one else. Not what is best for America, not you and me, and not democracy.

My friend said \"no he outright lied about every single thing he said\". But when I challenged him on the corruption from Biden and his team and the media gaslighting us all about Biden's mental and cognitive state, he said \"It really doesn't matter, we have to do whatever it takes to make sure he (Trump) doesn't get back in office\". That floored me. Now I realize how far afield people have went largely because of the media lying and shaping the narrative. But now that they've been caught, they're trying to move the goalpost so to speak. If anyone votes Democrat I would consider them an enemy of our country at this point.

Article III, Section I states that \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\" Although the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court, it permits Congress to decide how to organize it. Congress first exercised this power in the Judiciary Act of 1789. This Act created a Supreme Court with six justices. It also established the lower federal court system.\n\nJudicial Review\r\nThe best-known power of the Supreme Court is judicial review, or the ability of the Court to declare a Legislative or Executive act in violation of the Constitution, is not found within the text of the Constitution itself. The Court established this doctrine in the case of Marbury v. Madison (1803).\n\nRole\r\nThe Supreme Court plays a very important role in our constitutional system of government.\n\nFirst, as the highest court in the land, it is the court of last resort for those looking for justice.\nSecond, due to its power of judicial review, it plays an essential role in ensuring that each branch of government recognizes the limits of its own power.\nThird, it protects civil rights and liberties by striking down laws that violate the Constitution.\nFinally, it sets appropriate limits on democratic government by ensuring that popular majorities cannot pass laws that harm and/or take undue advantage of unpopular minorities. In essence, it serves to ensure that the changing views of a majority do not undermine the fundamental values common to all Americans, i.e., freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and due process of law.\"\n\n\nThere now you know what their job is or is not.",

    "If Trump was paying hush money to protect his brand why did he wait 6 years to do it instead of waiting until he was the Republican candidate for president in October 2016 just before the election? The defense could have called Allen Weisselberg or Trump's bodyguard  but didn't. Trump campaigned against Clinton saying \"lock her up\", against Biden by threatening Ukraine with with holding aid in exchange for saying Biden was under investigation, implied that Obama had a fraudulent birth certificate,  took out a full page ad trying to get the central park five executed (who were tried in the same courthouse). If you want to talk about weaponizing the Justice System then Trump should not be surprised that the tactics he used to get himself elected are the very ones he's complaining about (lock who up?).",

Just what do we do about that come Nov 6, after the election, if we get the wrong result?  Do we sit back and let them do it, or do we take all the legitimacy they will trash and enforce it in their faces when they start moving upon us, against every move they make as they make it?  How do we enforce it?  How do we enforce the Constitution, the laws, our rights and our freedom?  How do we act lawfully and legitimately?  Guess.  Hint...(?)  Yes, that's right.  You got it.",

So the plan of the Democrats is not to charge them for serious crimes, release them outright or agree to plea deals of much lesser charges, thereby preserving their future right to vote.\n\nThis nefarious Democratic Party scheme is now obvious and is championed by the corrupt likes of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Chuck the Schmuck Schumer, Obama, Cuomo the predator, Pelosi the Chinese intelligence operative who has received millions in Chinese bribes just like Biden has. If the puppet Kamala Harris becomes president, we'll actually see things get worse. We need Trump to save us from this Democratic Party Mafia.",

Never previously in a US  court has a defendant carried on like this. Pus Donald does not help himself by blatantly refusing to accept that it is a criminal offence to intimidate witnesses and insisting that his Constitutional rights override the Law. They definitely do not, And far from properly advising him, his lawyers have been complicit  in promoting misinformation.  This again makes the public suspicious and weakenee  any support they may have from him. \n\nIt is true that a lot of superfluous information, possibly detrimental to Donald,  came out in the evidence given by Daniels but, as the Judge has very clearly pointed out to Donald's defence team,  that was solely  due to bad lawyering by y them. They totally failed to object at the relevant time.  It is the general view of many lawyers and legal experts all over the world, that Donald did not put together  the best legal team for his defence.

    "We need to stop calling these people \"the Press\" in the same breath as we talk about the freedom of the press because that's not what the First Amendment is talking about and we know it. The Constitution says \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" What does this mean? It's obvious when you start looking to the words of our founding fathers. Let's take Thomas Jefferson's words:\n\n\"Printing presses shall be subject to no other restraint than liableness to legal prosecution for false facts printed and published\" (1783)\n\n \"A declaration that the Federal Government will never restrain the presses from printing anything they please will not take away the liability of the printers for false facts printed\" (1788)\n\n\"Our citizens may be deceived for awhile, and have been deceived; but as long as the presses can be protected, we may trust to them for light\" (1799)\n\n\"\u201cIndeed the abuses of the freedom of the press here have been carried to a length never before known or borne by any civilized nation. but it is so difficult to draw a clear line of separation between the abuse and the wholesome use of the press, that as yet we have found it better to trust the public judgment, rather than the magistrate, with the discrimination between truth & falsehood. and hitherto the public judgment has performed that office with wonderful correctness\" (1803)\n\nWhat is freedom of the press? It is the freedom of the printing press. The First Amendment did not expressly say \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, and of the printing press\" because it was assumed and known. There was no other \"press\" but the printing press. We hadn't taken to calling reporters who work for businesses \"press\" until much more recently. If we were to ask what this right means today? It is simply the right of all of the People to speak and write and to publish what we write. In modern words, that \"press\" is the Inkjet Printers, Laser Printers, etc. that any American may own and operate.\n\nWe have been so reliant on what many call the \"Mainstream Media\" that we have lost sight of what the Constitution means when it talks about the freedom of the press. The greatest threat to our democracy or republic (same thing) isn't the \"press\" mentioned in the Constitution because that's just printing technology. The threat are those who have usurped this right, which we all enjoy, and turned it on its head. They go around calling themselves \"the press\" but they are just ordinary men and women with access to technology that makes it easier for them to publish and disseminate information more widely than the middle schooler printing a newspaper in her bedroom and then distributing it to her friends, family and neighbors.",

    "Why Are So Few Democrats Unwilling To Talk About the \u201cJoe Biden Wide Open Border\u201d?   Because it is a  National Security Issue and they want to avoid it like the plague.\n\nIt is interesting that  26 Republican state attorney generals signed a letter supporting the governor of Texas concerning \u201cillegal Immigration\u201d.   Where are the Democrat states? No response. They don't care? Not one independent democrat voice says - \"There is a serious problem at the southern border\". I have not heard the Majority leader in the Senate  or the Democratic Minority leader in the House push the agenda of slowing down the huge number of \"illegal migrants\".\n\nRepublicans and Democrats cannot reach an agreement in the House. Republicans and Democrats cannot reach an agreement in the Senate. The House and Senate cannot reach an agreement with each other.  The President cannot reach an agreement with the Republicans. Usually when a situation develops like this,  the President goes on the road and tries to sell his solution to the American citizens. Just one problem. The President was recently (Jan 15th) asked by a reporter: Do you think there is a crisis at the southern border? Joe\u2019s answer: NO.  \n\nHouston, I think we have a problem!\n\nThe Democratic mayors of NYC, Chicago, and Denver complain continuously about lack of resources. However, they never mention closing down the border as a  solution. Their response for their cities is only, \"I need more federal money\". Which means more taxpayer money from all fifty states. The major democratic cities are saying, I have serious problems, so everyone in the US, send me some of your tax dollars.\n\nAre there no independent Democratic thinkers in the House or Senate? They all are like sheep. Democrats hold 264 seats in the House and Senate. The \u201cwide open Joe Biden border\u201d is a National Security risk. In National Security there are no Republicans or Democrats, it is an American issue. Take away the partisan politics and solve the problem.\n\nFor the Democrats,  the  \u201cwide open Joe Biden border\u201d requires conformity to the majority or a group mentality. Individuals are not making independent decisions. They all follow the \u201clead donkey\u201d and they all do the \u201cdonkey dance\u201d together. Usually you see this type of behavior in totalitarian organizations, which is not a healthy sign for democracy. \n\nJoe, are you listening? I know you like to talk about democracy for America.",

    "Even a cursory dip into the statistics of social and economic well-being reveals that Florida falls short in almost any measure that matters to the lives of its citizens. More than four years into the DeSantis governorship, Florida continues to languish toward the bottom of state rankings assessing the quality of health care, school funding, long-term elder care, and other areas key to a successful society.\n\nFlorida may be the place where \u201cwoke goes to die\u201d\u2014as DeSantis is fond of saying\u2014but it is also where teachers\u2019 salaries are among the lowest in the nation, unemployment benefits are stingier than in any other state, and wage theft flourishes with little interference from the DeSantis administration. In 2021, DeSantis campaigned against a successful ballot initiative to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage, which had been stuck at $8.65 an hour. Under DeSantis\u2019s watch, the Sunshine State has not exactly been a workers\u2019 paradise.\n\nLargely because of DeSantis\u2019s obstinacy, Florida is one of 10 states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, an act of political spite that has cost those states billions in federal health care dollars and cost thousands of people their lives. More than 12% of Floridians are without medical insurance, a worse record than all but four other states. Despite having the country\u2019s highest percentage of retirees, Florida has the worst long-term care among the 50 states, according to the American Association of Retired Persons.\n\nPublic schools fare no better than health care in DeSantis\u2019s Florida. Not only did Florida rank 49th in the country for average teacher pay in 2020, but the Education Law Center, a non-profit advocacy group based in New Jersey, found in a 2021 report that the state had the seventh-lowest per-pupil funding in the country. Education Week, which ranks states public school annually, looking beyond mere test scores, placed Florida 23rd in its 2021 report, a lackluster showing for a large and wealthy state.",

    "FYI No property has sold in Palm Beach County for more than $173 million.  That was a 15.65 acre beach to lake mansion comparable, though not as historic, as Mar-a-Lago.   There are only a handful of other properties in Palm Beach which have sold for over $100 million in the last decade, and that includes other mansions with guest houses, outbuildings, swimming pools and tennis courts, acreage and beach frontage comparable yo Mar-a-Lago.  The most expensive property to be listed on the market in the county, on it's own twenty acre island, went on sale early last year for $218 million.  Had to be taken off the market due to a lack of interest and was relisted for $183 million in December.  The point is that even if Donald Trump had not encumbered Mar-a-Lago with numerous building and subdivision restrictions, which he has for tax purposes, Mar-a-Lago is unlikely to sell for much more than $250 million.  Yet to this day Donald Trump doesn't just value it at $1 billion but $1.5 billion.  And thats how gargantuanly off he is with almost all of his property valuations. Donald Trump not only gives estimates of his personal wealth depending on his mood, which he has admitted, but has pushed officers in his company, as was testified to at trial, to follow those.  And they have worked backwards to come up with those valuations.",

    "Are Christians allowed to lie?\n\nThe question of whether Christians are allowed to lie is a complex and debated issue. The Bible unequivocally prohibits lying, as seen in the ninth commandment and various other scriptures. However, some argue that there are rare exceptions, such as lying to protect the lives of innocent people, as seen in the examples of the Hebrew midwives and Rahab. While the Bible does not explicitly state that there are instances where lying is acceptable, it is a matter of ongoing theological discussion. Ultimately, the general principle is that Christians are called to speak the truth, but there may be exceptional circumstances where some argue that lying could be justified. This remains a topic of interpretation and debate within Christian theology.\n\nDonald Trump has made a significant number of false or misleading statements during his presidency. \n\nAccording to fact-checking analyses, he made over 30,000 false or misleading claims during his four years in office, averaging about 21 erroneous claims per day. These claims have been extensively documented and scrutinized by various fact-checking organizations, and they cover a wide range of topics, including the economy, unemployment, and his administration's achievements. The scale of Trump's falsehoods has been described as \"unprecedented\" in American politics, and the consistency of his falsehoods has been noted as a distinctive part of his public identity.",

The combination of the drought and Colorado River water cuts have severely affected the growing season, and more cuts are coming in the new year. In August, the federal government announced that water deliveries to Arizona would be reduced by another 20%, starting in January of next year. \"Prolonged drought is one of the most profound issues facing the U.S. today,\" Tommy Beaudreau, assistant secretary of the interior, said in announcing the cuts. In Florida, the top supplier of fruits and vegetables in the U.S. during autumn and winter, Hurricane Ian caused up to $1.9 billion in damages to the state's agricultural industry, hitting orange and tomato crops particularly hard. *Studies have shown that Ian was wetter and more intense as a consequence of climate change.*",

Sanders signs a law that makes it easier to employ children_ March 10, 2023 This news article was published by _NPR._ Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed a law this week rolling back requirements that the state verify the ages of workers under 16 and provide them with work certificates permitting them to work. Effectively, the new law signed by the Republican governor applies to those who are 13 and 15 years old because in most cases Arkansas businesses can't employ those under 13. Under the Youth Hiring Act of 2023, children under 16 don't have to get the Division of Labor's permission to be employed. The state also no longer has to verify the age of those under 16 before they take a job. The law doesn't change the hours or kinds of jobs kids can work. \"The Governor believes protecting kids is most important, but this permit was an arbitrary burden on parents to get permission from the government for their child to get a job,\" Sanders' communications director Alexa Henning said in a statement to NPR. \"All child labor laws that actually protect children still apply and we expect businesses to comply just as they are required to do now.\" Child labor violations are on the rise as some states look to loosen their rules Business Child labor violations are on the rise as some states look to loosen their rules Workers under 16 in Arkansas have had to get these permits for decades. Supporters of the new law say it gets rid of a tedious requirement, streamlines the hiring process, and allows parents \u2014 rather than the government \u2014 to make decisions about their children. *But opponents say the work certificates protected vulnerable youth from exploitation.* \"It was wild to listen to adults argue in favor of eliminating a one-page form that helps the Department of Labor ensure young workers aren't being exploited,\" the group Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families wrote about the law in a legislative session recap. Arkansas isn't the only state looking to make it easier to employ kids in a tight labor market and fill an economic need. Bills in other states, including Iowa and Minnesota, would allow some teenagers to work in meatpacking plants and construction, respectively. New Jersey expanded teens' working hours in 2022. McDonald's franchise owners are caught violating child labor laws Law. Hundreds of migrant children work long hours in jobs that violate child labor laws. But the bills are also occurring alongside a rising tide of minors employed in violation of child labor laws, which have more than tripled since 2015, and federal regulators have promised to crack down on businesses that employ minors in hazardous occupations. There's no excuse for \"why these alarming violations are occurring, with kids being employed where they shouldn't even be in the first place,\" Jessica Looman, principal deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, told NPR in February. Investigators from the Department of Labor found hundreds of children employed in dangerous jobs in meatpacking plants. Last month, Packers Sanitation Services paid a $1.5 million fine \u2014 the maximum amount \u2014 for employing 102 children to work in dangerous meatpacking facility jobs.",

To be saved from hell and forgiven of all sin, believe that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, died on the cross for your sins, was buried, and rose again (1 Cor 15:1-4). When you believe that Christ\u2019s atoning work paid for all your sins and when you make Jesus your only hope of going to Heaven, you are forgiven of all sin by God and forever saved from hell. Warning: None of our good deeds can get us into Heaven. If we trust in our own works  to get us to Heaven instead of Christ\u2019s atonement, we will not be allowed in. The Bible says \u201cNot by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost\u201d (Titus 3:5). In conclusion, just believe that all your sins are paid for by Jesus\u2019 atoning work and make Christ your only hope of going to Heaven.\n\n\u201cFor when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.\u201d Romans 5:6",

EDA\u2019s _American Rescue Plan_ grant programs include: \n_Build Back Better Regional Challenge:_ $1 billion awarded to 21 regional coalitions (5-8 component awards per coalition), each of which received between $25 million and $65 million to transform their regional economy by growing an industry sector. EDA also gave awards to 60 phase 1 finalists to support the development of their ambitious projects. \n_Good Jobs Challenge:_ $500 million awarded to 32 industry-led workforce training partnerships to invest in innovative approaches to workforce development that will secure job opportunities for more than 50,000 Americans. \n_Economic Adjustment Assistance Program:_ $500 million awarded to 256 diverse projects \u2014including but not limited to enabling infrastructure, workforce development, business facilities and planning grants \u2014 to address the economic development needs of communities today while preparing them for the future by in investing in enabling infrastructure, workforce development, business facilities, and planning grants. _Indigenous Communities Program:_ $100 million awarded to 51 grantees to support economic development projects in Indigenous communities for similar types of projects as described under Economic Adjustment Assistance. Across all six American Rescue Plan programs, inclusive of the Indigenous Communities program, EDA awarded a total of 127 grants totaling $448 million. \n_Travel, Tourism & Outdoor Recreation Program:_ $750 million awarded to 185 grantees to help support regions hard hit by declines to these industries through projects to build new tourist attractions (museums, event venues, hiking trails, campgrounds, etc.), develop tourism-related economic plans, and support workforce training in the tourism sector. \nStatewide Planning, Research & Networks: $1 million planning grants to each of the 59 U.S. states and territories and $31 million to 15 research and networks (also known as Communities of Practice) grantees. \nAdditionally, when the _American Rescue Plan_ programs were launched in 2021, EDA committed $300 million to American coal communities through its _Coal Communities Commitment._ *Ultimately, EDA exceeded the commitment and awarded $551 million to coal communities.*",

    "The display of objects is not religious in nature except the cross which is common everywhere in the world. If people in the locality are so perplexed by a cross then a drawing can also perplex them so there will be no end to expensive litigations. The display of light and snow with deer and Santa cannot be termed as religious as deer, ice, lights, and Santa are not mentioned in the Bible. Folklore cannot be branded as religion anywhere. The display of the objects is within the owner's property and the land that the owner has legal rights. Display of any type can be done within the premises of the land and property owners expect the display of firearms, cannons, or bombs which may cause a nuisance as it may trigger fear and anxiety among any passerby or neighbor. Nuisance is defined as any act which is harmful or offensive to the public. Harmful here means that suppose a drain from the owner's land passing toxic enters another house or the water system of the neighbor is harmful in nature as it has direct interference with the health or physical damage to the neighbors. Offensive means any act that has direct or indirect interference with the comfort of the people in the surrounding areas which may be like the constant playing of Christmas carols on loudspeaker from sunrise to sunset which may be disturbing to non-Christians or the display of firearms or a dangerous pet dog. In this case, none applies. Non-Christians if they find the display offensive, have to prove that they have a great psychological negative impact on the mind which has to be supported with external proof like losing a job, money, or career, a prescription of a minimum 6 months from a Government doctor and Govt Doc will have to testify in the court that the display had great irretrievable damage to the psychology of the complainants and only then can some solution can be reached. The onus of proof is on the complainant only. Moreover, offence sometimes is internal and if there is no external proof nothing can be done to help the complainant.

Plus, during covid many of these hospitals denied medical care, kicked out family members who advocated for their loved ones, lied about treatments, and told vaccine injured patients they were crazy.  They\u2019re trying to normalize their bad behavior instead of acknowledging their own misconduct.  My father didn\u2019t even have covid when he was in the hospital, but when they decided they didn\u2019t want to treat him anymore, they pressured us to move him to palliative care.  They did this on the day we went to the hospital to sign informed consent for a procedure which would allow him to continue his treatment.  Whats even more evil was how they set up his room that day.  They sedated him, told us we couldn\u2019t touch him, turned out the lights, closed the shades, and got on to us when we tried to open them.  They figured out which nurse my mother liked solely to have her manipulate us into putting my father into palliative care.  The nurse really crossed the line when she lied to us and told us my father may not live through the night.  My father\u2019s attending nurse evidently didn\u2019t get the memo because they told us they were 99.9% sure he would live through the night.

    "During the 2020 election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent hundreds of millions of dollars to turn out likely Democratic voters. But this wasn\u2019t traditional political spending. He funded a targeted, private takeover of government election operations by nominally nonpartisan \u2014 but demonstrably ideological \u2014 nonprofit organizations.\r\n\r\nAnalysis conducted by our team demonstrates this money significantly increased Joe Biden\u2019s vote margin in key swing states. In places like Georgia, where Biden won by 12,000 votes, and Arizona, where he won by 10,000, the spending likely put him over the top.\r\n\r\nThis unprecedented merger of public election offices with private resources and personnel is an acute threat to our republic and should be the focus of electoral reform efforts moving forward.\r\n\r\nThe 2020 election wasn\u2019t stolen \u2014 it was likely bought by one of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful men pouring his money through legal loopholes.\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO\r\nIn her new book, \u201cRigged: How the Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized Our Elections,\u201d Mollie Hemingway reveals how social-media companies like Twitter and Facebook responded to the 2016 election of Donald Trump to go from free-speech advocates to censors \u2014 including blocking The Post\u2019s reporting on Hunter Biden. \r\nThe Center for Technology and Civic Life (CTCL) and the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) passed a staggering $419.5 million of Zuckerberg\u2019s money into local government elections offices, and it came with strings attached. Every CTCL and CEIR grant spelled out in great detail the conditions under which the grant money was to be used.\r\n\r\nThis is not a matter of Democrats outspending Republicans. Private funding of election administration was virtually unknown in the American political system before the 2020 election.\r\n\r\nBig CTCL and CEIR money had nothing to do with traditional campaign finance, lobbying or other expenses that are related to increasingly expensive modern elections. It had to do with financing the infiltration of election offices at the city and county level by left-wing activists and using those offices as a platform to implement preferred administrative practices, voting methods and data-sharing agreements, as well as to launch intensive outreach campaigns in areas heavy with Democratic voters. < > NEW YORK POST",

If you say biological women are the only ones that can have abortions then how do you turn around and question a biological woman gender thus creating the narrative of a pregnant man. Gender is determined at the time of conception, and woman / biological women only have the ability to carry/ nurture and deliver the fetus/ baby.  The Democrat have an unwinnable argument and women are not buying it. Plus again there are multiple methods of birth control on the market specifically for biological women to take and prevent pregnancy, and again, how do you justify not acknowledging the biology of a woman.

That day, Pirro appeared with her husband at a press conference in response to the charges, criticizing the investigation as \"invasive and hostile.\" On June 23, 2000, a jury found Pirro's husband guilty of 23 of the charges brought against him and not guilty of 10 others. He served 17 months in prison, being released early for good behavior and participating in an alcoholism treatment program. In the midst of the trial, Jeanine Pirro had attacked the prosecution for bringing up matters which involved her, calling it a \"desperate attempt by them to bring me into this wherever they can.\" Albert Pirro was pardoned by President  on January 20, 2021, shortly before Trump left office.\u201d\n\nThanks for playing, Jeanie",

Part of the official report on the massacre reads, \"Many white Tulsans were especially incensed when black Tulsans disregarded, or challenged, Jim Crow practices. Others were both enraged at, and jealous of, the material success of some of Greenwood's leading citizens.\" Newspaper reports following the massacre said only 36 people died, but historians now believe as many 300 people were killed as white mobs destr0yed and burned homes, businesses, churches, schools, hospitals and libraries in the predominantly black area. *No one was prosecuted for those de@ths or the destruction of property,* and, nearly 100 years later, many victims of the massacre have not been identified because their remains have not been found and the event has been allowed to fade from the history books.

    "The American Government  Is \u201cDeep In Debt\u201d and Congressional  Spending Is Continuing Higher.  Joe Bidden Is Leading The Charge!\n\n President Joe Biden said that he would be the most transparent President in American history in his 2021 Inaugural Address. Below are facts that Joe has not been very transparent with the American public.\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nJoe is taking America deeper into National Debt, now at $34.15 trillion dollars ($34,150,000,000,000). National debt increased so far by $3 trillion dollars under Joe Bidden.\n\nInterest paid on the National Debt is now marching higher: as the old debt matures at low interest rates, it must be replaced by debt at now much higher interest rates. Thus less money to fund America\u2019s social and defense programs. \n\nBy not invoking his \u201cveto\u201d authority, Joe allows Congress to annually spend one trillion 200 billion dollars ($1,200,000,000,000) more  than in collected tax revenue. This adds to the National Debt and forces higher debt interest payments, thus less money for future American programs.\n\n Never in 3 years has Joe vetoed an expenditure bill,  because it would raise the American National Debt. Joe will not veto a spending bill this year. Remember, Presidents do not veto spending bills in election years. They might lose their job! \n\nIf you allow Congress to spend $1.5 trillion more than tax receipts, it will be added to the National Debt. The U.S. government regularly issues new debt to meet its financial obligations and repay existing debt as it matures. \n\nAll Americans  are burdened every year to spend more of their income  to help pay the required National Debt interest payments. These National Debt interest payments will increase every year for the rest of our lives. Being on a fixed income will become increasingly more difficult. \n\nHere are some figures, concerning tax payments for the present and future national debt. Every year Congress only pays the interest payment of the national debt. They do NOT make payments to lower the principal on the national debt. Congress has an \"interest only\" national debt credit card. Do you have an \u201cinterest only\u201d credit card, where for the rest of your life,  you can spend more every year than you pay back? \n\nIn a few years Joe will no longer be alive, so the National Debt, \"won't be his problem.\"  Joe and Congress  will have passed it on to you, your children, grandchildren, etc.  Joe and Congress will have left the country in either extreme economic hardship or bankruptcy.\n\nFigures for present and future tax payments for the national debt.\n\n2020 $371 Billion Dollars \n2021 $392 Billion Dollars \n2022 $476 Billion Dollars \n2023 $800 Billion Dollars \n2024 $870 Billion Dollars \n2025 $951 Billion Dollars \n2026 $ 1.1 TRILLION Dollars\n\nIn five years the national debt interest payments have increased by 280% and will continue to increase. No problem says Joe and Congress, the American taxpayer \u201cwill pick up the tab\u201d. \n\n In 2022 Congressional spending     = $6.13 trillion dollars\n In 2022 Congressional tax receipts = $4.9 trillion dollars\n Added to National Debt                     = 1.23 trillion dollars \n\nThe National Debt increased by about $2.2 trillion in fiscal year 2023.\n\nIn 2024,  it is projected that the National Debt will increase by another $1.5 trillion dollars.  As far as the eye can see, every year Congress will spend at least a trillion dollars more than it receives. \n\nThis cannot continue forever. At some point the government will not be able to borrow at reasonable interest rates and pay all promised  expenditures.  The Federal Reserve Bank will be required to print money,  to pay  government expenditures. As a result, inflation will explode. \n\nThis has happened to many countries over the preceding years. Can it happen in the United States?",

If Donald Trump Donald Trump ever gets voted into office again he will make himself a dictator on day one and he has a lot of Yes Men waiting to fill every position from police officers all the way up to the government highest ranking positions that would make whatever Trump says is the law. When this happened he's going to treat his supporters just like every other dictator throughout history and treat you like third class citizens. Just Google how many supporters of Putin \"accidentally\" fell out windows. You will lose your freedoms and rights and there would never be another vote in the United States again.

    "This isn't new and it isn't even 'woke'  policy.   A local hospital and satellite ER have used such policies to get rid of difficult patients.  Do not leave loved ones unattended if they are in an altered mental state.  The main hospital threatened to put a 70 year old man who was just removed from a ventilator 'out' because he wanted to go home.  They called me that night and said I had 20 minutes to get there or they would call the police. My friend didn't even know who I was, where he was, or what happened. He wanted his mom & dad to take him home.   The hospital staff didn't care that his condition was a result of an induced coma and he would be altered for a few days.  Luckily I got ahold of the rehab facility to expedite pick up the next morning.  That night I found a doctor that gave him a sedative and forced the telemetry floor to keep him until transport.  If he could walk I would have tried to take care of him at home but he needed full rehab. \n\nThe satellite ER put a woman out that had been admitted with an altered mental state, chest pain,  and difficulty breathing. The doctors told me her d-dimer was positive for a clot and most likely had a PE and possible DVT.  They were going to do scans and transfer her to the main hospital and admit her.  The ER patient visitor policy allowed one visitor to stay in the room.  The visitor was not allowed to leave the room for any reason. I asked to use the restroom and get water to take my own meds and was told sure, but you won't be allowed back in. Sorry, policy. After I passed out it was time to take care of my self. I was dehydrated for sure. I talked to the nurse about leaving and was told it was no problem. She would be fine and they had a note on her chart she was altered.  She couldn't leave AMA without first being cognitively assessed.  I never thought to ask if they could throw her out, and they did.  Made her leave the building and sit outside in the rain wearing a nightgown that was see through when wet.  I don't know how long she was out there before I called to check on her and was told she wasn't their problem anymore.  She violated their patient policy and was forced to leave.  Having a life threatening condition of which her mental state was a symptom just didn't matter. \n\nThe hospital told me they stood by their policy.  The main hospital wouldn't accept her after we left the satellite ER. I was told to drive another 40 miles to the next hospital.  \n\nPatient conduct is just another way to turf patients  - nothing woke about it, just convenient.",

    "Navigating political landscapes can be incredibly dynamic and full of surprises, with each election cycle bringing its own set of challenges and unexpected candidates. It's fascinating to watch as different figures emerge and capture the public's attention, often reshaping the conversation and introducing new ideas and perspectives. Whether it's a seasoned politician or a fresh face, the emergence of a \"dark horse\" candidate can really invigorate the democratic process, encouraging more engagement and debate among the electorate.

    "Most illegal immigrants do not qualify for US asylum - - - The arrival of busloads of migrants into New York City has raised questions about the administration\u2019s border policies. Here are the facts about our increasingly dysfunctional immigration system:\r\n\r\nUnder US law, most migrants coming here without permission must be expelled. The only exceptions are migrants fleeing torture or racial, religious, ethnic, political or social-group persecution. \u201cEconomic refugee\u201d is a contradiction, and \u201cseeking a better life\u201d means nothing if a migrant lacks permission to enter. Otherwise, millions would seek entry and local governments would go bankrupt, medical and public-school systems would be strained, and America\u2019s poor would remain in poverty for generations.\r\n\r\nTo avoid such harms, Congress requires the Department of Homeland Security to prevent all illegal entries and has given it authority to quickly remove migrants who enter illegally or come without proper documents.\r\n\r\nDHS statistics reveal that the Biden administration has rarely used this \u201cexpedited removal\u201d authority. Between July 2021 and July 2022, the department processed 1.079 million migrants stopped at the southwest border for removal. Of that 1.079 million, it cleared just 41,206 to apply for asylum or other humanitarian protection in the US.\r\n\r\nDuring that same period, however, DHS released approximately 853,000 migrants stopped at the southwest border into the United States. Although those migrants are commonly called \u201casylum-seekers,\u201d these statistics show fewer than 5% are. < > NEW YORK POST",

Speaker The Communist Democratic Party accused Trump of tax evasion, but there was no evidence for the American people to believe that Trump was guilty. It was all because of Joe. Biden instructs DOJ &FBI to put Trump in jail, political weaponization Merrick Garland sends prosecutor Jack Smith to take orders to Florida without any evidence and charge Trump with 37 crimes, because President Trump has the right to reveal secrets documents and President Trump is not a spy or the person who caused the 1918 war named Jach Smith passed on to the January 6 rebellion masterminded by Pelosi The communist Democratic Party does not want Trump to run for President this year 2024 now everything is clear, prosecutor Jack Smith will probably graduate from jungle law school and there is no way to resolve the slander against President Trump. Jack Smith will lose his lawyer's license forever, only the President has not appointed him yet. The prosecutor's office investigated and through DOJ congressional chairman Merrick Garland arbitrarily appointed Jack Smith to investigate former President Trump, which was wrong in principle according to government executive agency regulations, and was prosecuted before the law. act of perceived wrongdoing in the political game, when people asked Jack Smith that when Joe Biden was Vice President, why did he bring secret documents home and keep them for more than 7 years without handing them over to the National Documents Archives Committee? before January 20, 2017.

Vice President Biden has no right to reveal secrets and keeps secret documents in the Garage. or the library, if convicted of Joe Biden disclosing secret national information, it is a crime of treason. Jack Smith has no way to answer but only listens to the American people criticizing prosecutor Jack Smith for announcing his decision. Center to prosecute President Trump without any evidence. Jack Smith is now in turmoil when Congress asks Jack Smith to hand over documents to prosecute Trump. He also doesn't know what he is doing. He only receives orders from DOJ Merrick Garland, and Jack Smith asked DC judge Chutkan Tanya to accuse Trump of slander. Jack Smith applied false charges of the constitution and law when Trump filed a lawsuit to the Supreme Court regarding freedom of speech under Article 1 of the Constitution.

(3)  Step 3, don't worry about the actual vote, there are enough mail-in ballots hidden strategically around the country to change the outcome in key states.  (4)  Step 4, get your picks elected.

    "It is interesting that  26 Republican state attorney generals signed a letter supporting the governor of Texas. Where are the Democrat states? No response. They don't care? Not one independent democrat voice says - \"There is a serious problem at the southern border\". I have not heard the Majority leader in the Senate  or the Democratic Minority leader in the House push the agenda of slowing down the huge number of \"illegal migrants\".\n\nRepublicans and Democrats cannot reach an agreement in the House. Republicans and Democrats cannot reach an agreement in the Senate. The House and Senate cannot reach an agreement with each other.  The President cannot reach an agreement with the Republicans. Usually when a situation develops like this,  the President goes on the road and tries to sell his solution to the American citizens. Just one problem. The President was recently (Jan 15th) asked by a reporter: Do you think there is a crisis at the southern border? Joe\u2019s answer: NO.  Houston, I think we have a problem!\n\nThe Democratic mayors of NYC, Chicago, and Denver complain continuously about lack of resources. However, they never mention closing down the border as a  solution. Their response for their cities is only, \"I need more federal money\". Which means more taxpayer money from all fifty states. The major democratic cities are saying, I have serious problems, so everyone in the US, send me some of your tax dollars.\n\nAre there no independent Democratic thinkers in the House or Senate. They all are like sheep. Democrats hold 264 seats in the House and Senate. The \u201cwide open Joe Biden border\u201d is a National Security risk. In National Security there are no Republicans or Democrats, it is an American issue. \n\nFor the Democrats,  the  \u201cwide open Joe Biden borders require conformity to the majority or a group mentality. Individuals are not making independent decisions. They all follow the \u201clead donkey\u201d and they all do the \u201cdonkey dance\u201d together.

The Constitution and U.S. forefathers were clear in their intent that no one in any government office who tries to overturn an election can run for any government office. That was their legacy to future generations.  Giving any President immunity from such actions will remove that safeguard from rule by tyranny - for your children.  Think carefully.  If you agree that the President is immune to the Constitution 's laws; can try to overturn election results; then that President can rule with impunity - whether Trump or Biden.  You are saying that the current President can do anything with immunity now - including rightfully disqualifying the past President who tried to overturn the general election results, including the State of Alabama's.  The strange thing is that the Supreme Court judges appointed by the past President are not yet taking action. If they don't, they are not needed."
