    "Agree 100%. Why can't he look at how the Biden Family does it. No one has committed more crimes than Joe Biden, but he knows how to keep his mouth shut. Think about it. He accepted millions in bribes as \"The Big Guy.\" He had boxes of classified documents in his garage, China Town and at The Penn Biden Center and yet you do not hear a word about any of it. That's how you get rich by making complete fools out of the idiots that vote for you. The funny part is that despite the fact that he is the most corrupt politician of the past two centuries he has the gall to talk about MAGA supporters.",

    "I know that I'm not the only one who has noticed this, but when Trump was arranged on the E. Jeane Carroll case, that was the only picture I've ever seen of him when his mouth was closed. That says something right there. He can't shut up. Even when it's in his best interest.",

    "Trump is a classic nassistic playing victim to a hungry audience of people he wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. \nTrump the narcissist\u00a0really\u00a0feels like a victim the victim, a victim of to much money and know real job in life, playing a role to tweeter social interactions to this benefit. \n\nTrumps has a strong sense of entitlement. This means he believes he is inherently worthy of special treatment, recognition, and privileges. \n\nHis a defense mechanism is activated by his privilege it serves a purpose of his unbelief in America as a place for all people, especially those unlike him. \n\nTrump has a high need to have control, and sometimes, playing the victim can serve this purpose. Having control of an audience of nassistic people that will listen to deep seeded fascist BS! \n\nTrumps personality like Tucker has a hard time taking criticism or rejection. They\u00a0 react\u00a0with rage feeling like the victim of someone else\u2019s attacks. \u201cI\u2019m enraged because\u00a0you\u00a0attacked\u00a0me.\u201d Ouh, poor baby! \n\nLike Tucker his grandiose narcissism dose not experience guilt in any situation. This makes him more use\u00a0more manipulative tactics\u00a0on his audience,\u00a0 to get his emotional need. His Low empathy also makes it difficult for him understand or care where someone else is coming from, a true Fascist rarely could. Like Tucker his unempathic spirit\u00a0 cannot understand why his behavior would hurt you, to him, you are just complaining and treating him unfairly. \n\nMr. Trumps aspersions cannot resolve the issues of the raging American population that since COVID have lost their minds thinking Washington should be run like the Appreciate show on TV, their cultural biases and hate fed daily by Carlson and similar media on TV and internet.",
    "\ua4d5\u042fump's incoherent, stream of consciousness way of communication in another of many indicators of his inability to manage an intelligible thought process. That characteristic alone should make obvious \ua4d5\u042fump's basic disqualification for holding any public office. \r\nTo be fair, I don't know what to make of President Biden's calling Xi Jinping a 'dictator' immediately after his own Secretary of State was engaged with Xi in an attempt to reduce tensions and normalize U.S.-China relations. That seemed to be an unfortunately reflexive comment by the President of the United States. On the positive(?) side, at least it was coherent.\nNicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China said that other U.S. cabinet officials will be visiting China in the months to come. Again, assuming Beijing does not change its mind in light of Biden's remark on Xi.  In any case, *_\"Vote Blue, No Matter Who\"_*",

    "I swear to God, I'm really inclined to believe that the MAGA GOP is demon  possessed. Never in my life have I seen such lies, filthy tactics, revenge, violence and treasonous behavior in a political party. They are tearing this nation apart in favor of a dictatorship. They know they lost everything and will continue to lose everything. Trump is holding a knife to the throat of America. If this man (or anti-Christ rookie) is not stopped, he'll swish the knife.",

Yet everyone keeps reporting how guilty he is and acting like he's going to jail.  You need to report on everything I just pointed out and push to get a Judge that he didn't appoint or all this is for nothing  ..Agian",
    "Unless they get a different Judge none of it will matter even if found guilty.  None of the charges have a minimum sentence and itll be just like all the other times \"Trump is going to jail\". We keep blowing it up every time he's caught doing something then he gets away. Wash, rinse, repeat",

    "Trump is an attorney's worst nightmare!   He has a right to remain silent....but he just won't!  Trump's agenda is to throw a monkey wranch in the works to keep everybody trying to guess his next move!  He'll do everything he can  to drag these case's out long enough so he can win  the  primary!  Delay, delay, delay!  That has always been his strategy!  In or out of office!

    "Everything he says is an admission by a party opponent. It\u2019s all admissible and very damaging to his defense. I remember watching Gwyneth Paltrow and thinking she was a defendant attorney\u2019s dream. Straightforward, honest sounding and imo, likeable. That can make such a difference at trial, and the judge or jury. I think she had just as many wanting her to lose but she convinced those naysayers as well. Compare her performance to his.

    "It is heartbreaking to watch and learn that the law in America is NOT equal to every American citizen in the United States. Trump, who committed insurrection by providing aid and comfort to the attackers is unbelievably running for president after his appalling attempt to steal the election and pursue autocratic power over the government is entirely related to section 3 in the 14th Amendment. Unlike sedition and insurrection, treason would have been more profound and is specifically and narrowly defined by the Constitution. The highest and worst crime ever committed by a president must be directly punished with imprisonment without exception. Trump is a major danger to the US. As of December 2023, Donald Trump has been personally charged with 91 criminal offenses in four criminal cases. This total reflects charges related to Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election with election interference in Georgia, falsifying business records in New York, and mishandling classified records after leaving the presidency. Donald Trump is the first former president in U.S. history to be criminally indicted. This indicates that Trump committed by far the most devastating crime to end democracy in the history of the United States, and this must be immediately punishable by law no matter what position he was in, be it president, officer, or citizen. Trump, with a clear record to be the first proven criminal who committed a well-prepared insurrection, should have been in prison for the criminal acts he almost accomplished. People died in the insurrection and hundreds of people went to the hospital and prison for whom he couldn\u2019t care less. Within the White House all governing people inside were running for their lives to safety while he was trying to take over the government to falsify the election. People have been arguing for some years about section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment which is in its description plain and simple while criminal Trump still walks freely around, causing more chaos and falseness. When the Supreme Court is not capable of upholding the laws and it must be examined to what degree they support Trump. Trump is obviously derailed and dangerous and must be imprisoned for life, and certainly immediately banned from running for president. Choosing not to pursue accountability for fear of political criticism or consequences would itself be a deeply irrevocable dangerous political act. Congress must take up the responsibility to end this overwhelming disturbing part of US history, instigated by Trump\u2019s actions that created turmoil within the justice system. This is, unfortunately, not the end of this story!",

The house members on the right stop getting checks and their staff as well. You donate a .25% more to republicans or right leaning causes as a business we freeze payments on your contracts as we simply don't have the money to pay them. \nStretch what's left longer, hurt who's causing the pain more, and likely even make him more popular by not bending over backwards to the parts of the population that hate him anyway while still providing what aid he can to those who are on the fence or on his side.",

Russia couldn't have destroyed USA better than the Democrats have. MSNBC, CBS, & NBC are the democrats mis information biased brain washing propaganda machine. 4 more years of Biden type democrats, and we will have a dictator.  We will no longer be free.  Our debts will result in an overthrow. So the new government is not responsible for the debts. No body will get paid back. Your money will be useless.  The green back will no longer be legal tender.  Every thing you worked for is gone. Gold is the only thing that will have value. The new government will be communist and they will take your gold, your house and property also. You will then be a slave to the government.  If you are a burden on them, you will be eliminated. Smart people will leave. Complainers will be sent to a slave type work camp. If you won't work, you die. You can thank Bidens Blacks for the change in government. You see it on the TV so you know what I have said has merit. For the sake of your family & your children, don't vote for any democrats or black people please.  You have been warned.\nIsrael is surrounded by half blacks or Arabs like in IRAN. They want a cease fire just as HAMAS is about to be destroyed.  They haven't forgotten that HAMAS shot thousands of rockets into their neighbors houses killing woman, children, fathers, and their dog. Blacks just don't care about whites. When Blacks take over America, Israel & Ukraine won't be supported.\nDemocrat biased propaganda TV media MSNBC, NBC, CBS, wants more blacks like in HAITI, but over population is the next global problem & whites are not safe around blacks. Blacks are now taking over New York. Steal the wealth of whites and drive them out. We need less black lawyers because less racist lawyers would be better.\nBlacks killed all white people in Africa for a million years, until a breeding pair of leucism whites escaped Africa & populated the only exit from Africa, the Nile Delta by the promised land Israel.\nThat is why the worlds DNA came from one small group of Leucism whites. They couldn't let murdering blacks into their community & that blocked blacks from getting out on the only land bridge out of Africa. Look at the map fool. Desert to the North, snow mountains to the East, surrounded by water.\nThat is BLACK ROOTs history that blacks don't put on their monuments.\nBlacks and whites can not get along and should not live close to each other as was proven by blacks for a million years.  You aren't a slow learner are you ?\nBlacks do the opposite of selective breeding for improvement.\nBlacks are racist because of the inability to be popular amoungst whites, first impression is visual, blacks are ugly, & popularity is everything. That is why they killed all whites.\nCamera's can't show a black face very well and a lot of Black actors face can't even be seen on TV. That is a face for radio. Stupid is as stupid does.\nOnly a racist would hire a black actor when a white actor that is equal or better is available. \nLook at the TV, Black men want lighter colored skin women & straight hair that is not black. Me too. Blacks have voted with their feet, & indicate that whites are superior.\nBlack sperm contaminates a beautiful white woman's children's DNA forever...\nYou can't tell people what to like or dislike and people don't like blacks for good reason. Blacks call that SYSTEMIC RACISM.\nBlacks are quick to play the race card and quick to teach their children racism. Mindlessly.\nUSA will look and act like the Haiti revolution is now if BLACK DEMOCRATS get elected.\nDON'T VOTE FOR A BLACK PERSON or their PUPPET, like Biden.\nBiden is doing everything the Russians want.\nLester Holt is a Biden follower, a racist & a liar.\nBiden and his party are feverishly trying to bankrupt, imprison and remove from the ballot his foremost opponent Donald Trump. That is what bad government looks like. Destroying Trumps finances is vote manipulation.

    "Does MSNBC understand its role in the problem with some Americans thinking that an election was stolen?\n\nMake no mistake, the point of the spear is Donald Trump, but he leveraged the system that was in place.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when you have mail in voting, and complex Voting rules that sometimes extend the amount of time it takes count votes to days or weeks after the official voting day, it is impossible to predict exactly how an election will go. As a result, in an effort to get ratings, networks like MSNBC, CNN, ABC CBS and NBC, and even, do the nation of disservice by speculating how the vote is going, or relating exit poles.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, it is certainly valid to look at actual data and say this is how it\u2019s going so far to people who understand what\u2019s happening. But when you have an aging electorate, most of whom when they are older end up being conservative, and at 8 PM on Tuesday, you tell them that their candidate is winning, and then at 1 AM, it turns out that the vote has changed, and then a week later, it\u2019s too close to call, it is irresponsible in my view for our news media to be making any statements or predictions at all as far as who is going to win. For those people who aren\u2019t in the political process, in a society where we expect things to happen instantaneously, when the polls close and you watch the evening news and the news is saying that one candidate has the vast majority of us, if your candidate is winning you\u2019re gonna think you\u2019ve won. And when your candidate then says \u201cthis elections been stolen, we\u2019ve already won,\u201d it\u2019s not difficult to imagine that people who are just barely paying attention are going to believe that. All the facts that they\u2019ve seen support the narrative.\n\nI would love to see the news networks make a pledge to not broadcast any undecided voting information at all. In other words, stop doing exit poles, stop doing anything other than reporting completed vote counts.\n\nLook, I get it that you need to have some kind of content on voting day, but it should not be anything that the casual observer could see as saying that a candidate is winning. I would even go so far as not to give anything inconclusive. But at minimum, we should not be using exit poles at all for our elections in 2024.",

    "Rachel, you're a bit behind the times, love. Transnistria broke away from Moldova in 1990. Putin is to the Russophile separatists behind the breakaway, what Trump is to MAGA. Ditto the separatists in the self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine's Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk, who have been trying to break away since 2014 in the wake of a popular uprising that kicked out a Kremlin puppet who sabotaged Ukraine's application for EU membership in favour of closer ties to Moscow. Meanwhile, Georgia's civil war with Abkhazia and South Ossetia first flared up in 1992. In 2008, it led to a Russian invasion and the short-lived Russo-Georgian War after a number of deliberate provocations by the South Ossetians.\n\nThe fact is that after the break up of the Soviet Union, majority ethnic Russian regions of the newly independent (or in most cases, once more independent) countries refused to accept that they were no longer Russian citizens. Putin, for his part, has always refused to accept the demise of the Soviet Union and wants to reconstitute it. Over the last quarter of a century, the two things have converged as Putin has supported the separatist movements to both keep the former Soviet republics in a state of instability and to provide him with a _casus belli._",

    "Americans were convinced to be complacent. We were told \"the cold war\" is over. In fact, it just progressed in a different format. Putin was there, as a KGB agent, for the fall of the Berlin Wall. His lifetime international attitude was shaped in that moment.  All of his actions have been consistent with developing a Western Europe that uses Russia for essential survival supplies (like gas). At the same time, Putin has been attempting to work with other dictators in Eastern Europe and the Middle East in order to achieve complete shipping control of the region. The loss of the young Russian males in Ukraine was only the first step. Putiin will conscript males from other countries as he continues his expansion. The loss of Trump's position was a blow, but Putin was prepared to have Trump continue from the sidelines. Putin was prepared to collaborate with Iran in order to direct Hamas in a full-scale terrorist attack on the Israelis. Ultimately, shipping in the area is expected to come under control of the Middle Eastern dictators and Putin. For Putin,  the war in Gaza has the advantage of dragging in the European nations of NATO and America. It destroys the entire region at no cost to Russia. There is little that we can do in the face of such aggression from America, except to support our current President Biden.

The original creditor is allowed to demand immediate payment of the mortgage, meaning that property is only worth $100M against the value of the bond.  Since Trump has nearly all his properties mortgaged to the ceiling, he could lose ALL his properties to cover the bond.  The best part?  Once sold and all creditors cleared, those aren't his properties anymore.  He'd have to buy them back.  Since his 'wealth' is all from debt, he's going to find it very difficult to do so.

Did you believe, even for a moment that the rights claim that Joe Biden had lost to Donald Trump? Probably not. That is likely due in large part to confirmation bias. Everyone, display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes.  Neither you nor is Donald Trump immune to confirmation bias. A belief held by Donald Trump that he was the rightful 2020 winner of the 2020 election, whether he be correct or mistaken, means that the defendant Donald Trump lacked mens rea.",

To achieve this, it is crucial to ensure that justice is served fairly and unconditionally, especially in the case of individuals like Trump.\r\nBy holding Trump accountable through a just and impartial legal process, the nation would not only uphold justice in this particular instance but also send a strong message to deter similar occurrences in the future. This would demonstrate the country's firm stance against any violations of its laws and principles, regardless of a person's status or influence.\r\nThe significance of this effort cannot be understated, as it would reinforce public trust in the democratic institutions that form the foundation of the American ethos. Upholding the rule of law and safeguarding core values are vital for preserving the integrity of the nation and ensuring that its citizens and the international community can rely on America's commitment to fairness, justice, and equality.\r\nTherefore, it is incumbent upon the country to embrace this opportunity to reassert its dedication to the rule of law and make a resolute stand against any transgressions.

    "Let\u2019s take a philosophical approach to this issue, shall we? Did Trump have a moral obligation on Jan. 6? Not really. So he had a causal responsibility, right? Not necessarily. Is a person morally responsible for an outcome if their actions were a necessary cause of that outcome? So, let's take a hypothetical situation as an example. Let's say there\u2019s a person (B) who is standing on the edge of a cliff and another person pushes them off. The person who pushes the other person (A) off the cliff is clearly morally responsible for their life threatening injury right? Wrong. If person B was never on the edge of the cliff, then person A would never have had the pristine opportunity to push that person. So, if something would have happened anyway, regardless of another person's actions, then that person isn't morally responsible. So, in the case of our hypothetical example, if the person who walked away never saw the person on the cliff, the person on the cliff would have never given the other person a chance to be pushed and eventually fallen anyway, and therefore, the person who walked away, which in this case is Trump, isn't morally responsible.",

    "@5:48 that lady asking \"why? \" sure is a dummy, . . If people like her were willing to open their eyes  and see this problem would disappear overnight, but instead they stand around wringing their hands acting like Trump doesn't have a base",
    "\"Do you seriously believe that Trump's decision to pardon the insurrectionists won't provoke liberals to arm themselves, as many on the right have done? This action could lead them to feel the need to defend their homes and our culture against such threats. Remembering historical events like the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre, where children and elders were killed, underscores the dangers of extremist ideologies. This event, tied to the American Indian Religious Crimes Codes, was an early instance of Christian Nationalism. It wasn't until Jimmy Carter's 1978 Freedom of Religion Act that these codes were revoked.\r\n\r\nThere's also the published statement that Trump's wife mentioned his habit of reading Hitler's speeches. Such statements, true or not, contribute to a concerning image. Furthermore, the comment about Trump and ethnic New York seems off the mark. In my experience, New York City, unlike places like Oklahoma, Texas, and Pennsylvania, feels safer and less inclined toward racist or anti-immigrant rhetoric. New York's sophistication contrasts starkly with Trump's provincialism, echoing the mistakes of figures like Father Coughlin and Huey Long, which were eventually addressed by the Vatican and other influential leaders. Trump's attitude and views remind me more of historical figures like the Lindberghs and Henry Ford, whose provincial outlook and ignorance were at odds with the progressive values that America aspires to uphold for the world's future.\"",

This is the perfect storm for disaster!!",
    "As much as this sickens me, if Trump is the nominee, and he vows to extend the Trump tax cuts, I will still vote for him. At the end of the day, voting is a financial decision. Everything else is just noise. As a single person LLC, who has to do both corporate and individual returns, I am a Republican, despite disagreeing with all their policies, because they are still the pro-business party. The moment they lose the business community, is the moment I will stop being a Republican voter. As long as there is a financial incentive, I will remain a Republican voter, unless the Democrats offer a better financial incentive.",

And then, so she could stay here, she married an America and then, like all of them she got pregnant and had an anchor baby.  so I say send both her and her anchor baby back home where they belong, and strip that child of his American citizenship!\"  So long Melania - so long Barron.",

    "Interesting fact: Did you know that Donald Trump's German ancestry has led some to draw parallels between him and Adolf Hitler? While ancestry alone doesn't determine character or beliefs, it's fascinating how history connects different figures. Let's remember, though, that drawing parallels doesn't imply sameness or equality. Understanding history helps us learn and grow.",

    "Think whatever you want. Just do it critically and with genuine intellectual honesty.\n\nThe 5 Steps to Critical Thinking: \n\nWhat is critical thinking?\nIn general, critical thinking refers to actively questioning statements rather than blindly accepting them. \n\nCritical thinking results in radical free will. \n\n1. The critical thinker is flexible yet maintains an attitude of healthy skepticism. \n\nCritical thinkers are open to new information, ideas, and claims. They genuinely consider alternative explanations and possibilities. However, this open-mindedness is tempered by a healthy sense of skepticism (Hyman, 2007). \n\nThe critical thinker consistently asks, \u201cWhat evidence supports this claim?\u201d\n\n2. The critical thinker scrutinizes the evidence before drawing conclusions. \n\nCritical thinkers strive to weigh all the available evidence before arriving at conclusions. In evaluating evidence, critical thinkers distinguish between empirical evidence versus opinions based on feelings or personal experience. \n\n3. The critical thinker can assume other perspectives. \n\nCritical thinkers are not imprisoned by their own points of view. Nor are they limited in their capacity to imagine life experiences and perspectives that are fundamentally different from their own. Rather, the critical thinker strives to understand and evaluate issues from many different angles. \n\n4. The critical thinker is aware of biases and assumptions. \n\nIn evaluating evidence and ideas, critical thinkers strive to identify the biases and assumptions that are inherent in any argument (Riggio & Halpern, 2006). Critical thinkers also try to identify and minimize the influence of their own biases. \n\n5. The critical thinker engages in reflective thinking. \n\nCritical thinkers avoid knee-jerk responses. Instead, critical thinkers are reflective. Most complex issues are unlikely to have a simple solution. Therefore, critical thinkers resist the temptation to sidestep complexity by boiling an issue down to an either/or, yes/no kind of proposition. Instead, the critical thinker expects and accepts complexity (Halpern, 2007). \n\nCritical thinking is not a single skill, but rather a set of attitudes and thinking skills. As is true with any set of skills, you can get better at these skills with practice. \n\nIn a nut shell, critical thinking is the active process of minimizing preconceptions and biases while evaluating evidence, determining the conclusions that can reasonably be drawn from evidence, and considering alternative explanations for research findings or other phenomena. \n\nCRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS\n>Why might other people want to discourage you from critical thinking? \n\n>In what situations is it probably most difficult or challenging for you to exercise critical thinking skills? Why? \n\n> What can you do or say to encourage others to use critical thinking in evaluating questionable claims or assertions?",

Our weaponized / politicized DOJ  is doing all it can to run interference , but they may soon be exposed for the corrupt agency they have become.  On top of that , Americans see the destruction being brought on our country.  The broken border is one of the best examples of that.  Our talking heads in the media interview incompetents like Mayorkas that keep telling us the border is under control.  Yet we watch the video of millions per year flooding in.  Even NYC is beginning to buckle under the load.  Now the cartels are bringing rainbow fentanyl across the open border , designed to attract our youth.  The dollar is about to fall as the worlds reserve currency.  A new alliance is formed between Russia, China, N Korea, and Iran.  A flawed energy policy will likely bring rationed electricity to the US.  Crime is epidemic in our major cities.  And the list goes on.  How is a biased moderator going to be able to handle running cover for Biden during a debate this time.

    "WHY are we looking at the election like a horse race?  Are votes going to be formed by this?  Why not focus on the issues?\r\nKeep seeing reporters, even on the 'Mainstream' side of the scale, treating these incredibly important elections like they are horse races, focusing on polls.  How about avoiding 'gotcha' questions designed purely to create conflict where none is needed and instead focus on issues that voters do care about and getting clear answers from Politicians who want to have it both ways.  Politicians often want the voters who stridently favor the 'unpopular issue' to be their core voters, to inpsire them and get them voting, but then be vague to the rest of the population and make 'nice noises' so people can pretend the poltician agrees with them.  Strategic ambiguity is a tactic Trump could carry off in 2016 because the MSM did not dig deep, but now we know who he is.  Do the background checks that would have uncovered a George Santos.  Do the research to uncover issues and consequences.\r\nWhy is it that comedians such as John Oliver are the ones who are tasked with doing this research?  News organizations are not supposed to be unbiased.  They are supposed to be strongly biased toward the truth and for the benefit of the people.  Stop pretending in this modern day that you cannot tell the difference between the two parties and 'it does not really matter'.  Stop leaving it to the parties to dig up the truth and spread it while you sit on the sidelines keeping count of the voters, based on how many have been kept from the truth, not helping to spread the facts.\r\nHow does it help a voter decide which way to vote, to know who has the most votes?  Instead tell the voters what the stakes are, what the issues are and which candidates favor which sides on the issues, which candidates have what track records and making sure those track records and facts are real, in context and not cherry picked.  Do not JUST fact check, but also fact originate.",

However, there\u2019s an 1868 law which readmitted 6 states to the union that keeps anyone involved in an insurrection off the ballot.

Whoever is in front will get the most negative news coverage.  \nNotice that with Biden, if you name the things he did and ask people if they like it, they say yes.  Sure, he is not the most charismatic, or the most agressive, hollywood picture of an ideal candidate, but when you set him up compared to Trump it will be the big win every time.  You want more from Biden?  Give him larger margins in the Senate and a solid majority in the House.  Kick loose the most toxic Republicans so the rest of them can start governing again.

There are people who still have a vision of the parties from 5 and 10 and 20 years ago.

    "A \"Free Press\"  --  journalists  --    is the only profession mentioned and protected by the U.S. Constitution. Our forefathers saw journalists as essential to a democracy. Therefore, when Trump attacks \"the media\" or \"mainstream media\" or whatever, it is simultaneously attacking our Constitution. This criminal is so grossly unfit for any office. By the way, \"the people\" spoke during the 2020 election; however Trump would not respect the voice of the people. He was fired. He then led a coup in an attempt to overturn the will of the people. Who, then, is the enemy of the people? . . . The facts speak for themselves: Trump and his conspirators are enemies of the people.

This manifesto is over 900 pages so very few people will read it. It takes humanity out of our future and its major tenet calls for dismantling federal agencies, getting rid of more than 45 thousand federal employees by changing their status so they can fired.

    "\"The press is the enemy of the people\", that's the mantra of all authoritarian and communist regimes and that's the first thing he said after taking office in 2016. At that time NO news media did anything about it. I told my friends right there and then that this man,(donald trump ) wants to become a dictator and destroy America and it's democracy.,But NO ONE in the media did anything about it,until now and it might be too late. How can a lay person like myself, saw the writing on the wall and the media did not.????I believe, that the media failed  doing their job . I asked myself why? My believe is, that talking about trump gave them ratings and kept their audience coming back for more. I will always back the media, but they failed immensely. I also told my friends, that I was very afraid, that this grifter, will have access to all the secrets of this country and look what he did with classified information. Once a grifter, always a grifter. He is worse than the Mafia. If from the beginning the media  would have done their job many peoples' eyes, would have been opened from the beginning. But the media laid out the red carpet for trump and let him enslave many  people with his cult of hate and discrimination.I very seldom watch the news anymore. I like the independent ,young people,who show the facts like they are, just because they really are interested in the well being of this country and to give their subscribers ,facts and proof of what really is happening. They are fighting for the country, that they will inherit and care about.. As I said, I will always stand behind the media. Without the media, good or bad, we will be living like in Putin's Russia, where he decides what you should know or not.. Let's appreciate what we have and not let a grifter, ( he's been one his entire life), to destroy what many good people fought and died for: DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM to  make our own choices.Hope the media will change it's ways from sensation to real news, that will hold everyone accountable from the beginning and work hard to find out the truth ,no matter what.",

If that is truly why Trump hasn't been locked up yet it's a foolish argument. It's based on the same lack of foresight that kept those who knew about violence being possible on Jan 6 from preventing it. \nIf our legal system worked correctly Trump would be, as most defendants who threaten the public's safety,  LOCKED UP. If it were ANYONE ELSE they would be locked up. There are always crazies out there. Let's get the biggest one we know about off the streets. There is plenty of legal evidence to do this now. \nTreating his run for president like it's \"normal\" is the scariest thing. If our legal system doesn't stop this man who has led a treasonous uprising from running for office again (14th amendment) then we may as well let him trash the constitution because it's meaningless.

Think about Trump having mass arrests of Dems and law enforcement whom he dislikes, not sure many people realize just how violent and suppressive another Trump Presidential four years would be.

Who was indicted for election fraud, campaign finance violations and financial fraud?  Whose company was found guilty of bank fraud, tax fraud and tax evasion? Who was indicted under the espionage act for mishandling America's top secrets and putting American service men and women lives in danger?  Who was impeached for attempting to bride a foreign leader to make up dirt on his political opponent? Who was impeached a second time for inciting his followers to carry out an insurrection?  Who caused the needless deaths of 100s of thousands of Americans by totally mismanaging the handling of the Covid epidemic? Who used the presidency to enrich his family to the tune of billions of dollars?  Who told endless LIES and continues to LIE to the American people? Who insulted American service men who sacrificed their lives for their country? Who insulted American heroes for being captured POWs(including John McCain)? Who colluded with Russia in his campaign to win the 2016 election?  Who refused to concede defeat in a free and fair election in 2020, and still continues to knowingly LIE about that election to this day?  Who praised and believed Putin over his own intelligence agencies, people who actually risk their lives to keep America safe?  Who has no respect for law or law officials and has defamed dozens of law enforcement officials?  Who said they had bone spurs to avoid serving in the military?  Who bragged about sexually assaulting women?  Who was indicted for trying to overthrow the duly elected government?  Who continues to fleece his followers with ENDLESS LIES?  Who called Putin a genius for an unprovoked attack, invading another country, slaughtering innocent women and children?  Who threatens law enforcement virtually every day(calling a prosecutor deranged is a veiled threat)? Who has still more criminal indictments to come? Who speaks only ill of America's allies and praises the leaders of the most heinous regimes? Very important to mention that Trump declared his presidential run extremely early to use it as a shield against his criminal culpability!

You intentionally left out the parts where the police willingly LET people into the capitol while trying to sell the story of Trump having some sort of dog whistle or secret coded message that somehow turns \u201clet\u2019s have a peaceful protest\u201d into \u201cwe need to overthrow the government.\u201d Because sending supporters into the capital building will give them no chance but to keep Trump on as president, and that definitely was the plan because it makes so much sense and definitely would have worked.",

Trump and his goons will go down hissing and spitting like a bag of wild cats.  This should be expected.  It doesn't have to be tolerated, but expected.  The same could be said of the MAGA republicans in the House.  They don't want a shutdwon because of any concerns for fiscal responsibility.  They want to wreck any attempts for the economy or the government to actually work.  That way we can have \"Only I can fix it\" 2.0 all over again.  Same with any of their investigations.  The threats, the blatant sabotage of the government, military, and the economy and the constant threats against law enforcement, prosecutors, and the public at large (like Trump telling Jewish Americans to fall in line or regret it.  No subtlety there) are all part of a plan to try and make everything so chaotic, so wrecked, that the public (they hope) will reelect Trump out of fear of what the future holds believing he can make it all go away.  That's all any of this bullsh*t is... just gasoline to light the fires and burn democracy down.  And every American has the match.  It's all on us to decide whether to burn it all down and leave a horrible future for out children and grandchildren and to wreck what out forefathers died to build.  Or do we put the matches down and walk away?  Our democracy will not die from our enemies.  We've always had our hands around it's neck.  It's always been up to us, the American people, to choke the life out of it or let it live and flourish.

Personally I think a jail cell should fit comfortably inside the White House I'm sure they can set it up outside the privy. And of course corrections will be able to keep track of his moves.

    "Donald father Fred Trump Sr. was 93 yrs old when he died. Donald will be 77 on June 14th. so he might only have 16 years left before he dies, maybe more, or maybe less. That might give him 15 years to sit in prison, if he's lucky (or unlucky) to live that long. Not the plural of decades, and decades, and decades! I feel sorry for the Secret Service Agents who might have \"guard\" him while he's in prison, unless that privilege is taken away from him if he is found guilty of espionage, and he has to forfeit that. I will be happy if he gets no more than 15 years, because he might have Alzheimer's by then as his dad did before he died. \nI want to see Donald Trump sitting behind bars, with no phone, no TV in his cell, and no social media. I don't have any knowledge of how Federal Prisons work, but here in Michigan, some prisons have tablets with very little abilities other than looking up different things. I know of one prison in Northern Florida who houses people convicted of 1st. Degree Murder who have access to tablets. It only takes one inmate who knows how to get one open, and can hack a tablet so it can go to websites that prisoners are not supposed to have access to. I know of one man who was convicted of 1st. degree murder because he murdered his 20 year old wife (my unofficial daughter) in front of his 3 year old toddler daughter. He killed her in 1986 in West Palm Beach Florida 37 years ago. Sometime in or before 2018, I think he left a message for his grown daughter, probably on her Facebook page, because she closed down her FB page, and we (my birth daughter and I) haven't seen or heard a word from her since then. I'm certain she and her children are in hiding, and want nothing to do with him. He killed her mom! \nSo if Donald goes to a federal prison in Florida, there is a chance he might get his chubby little hands on a tablet there. The first place he would want to go to on a tablet would be his Truth Social web sight, so he can send out a call to his radical followers to try to break him out of there. I know his followers are not the sharpest tools in the shed, but if he asked them to do that, there would be a few really stupid ones who would try it.",

    "That indictment was fascinating to read because it explains how documents are classified and it gives a perfunctory but very useful overview of the Untited States Intelligence Community. It may be the most edifying thing I have read about US Government structure and operation since college. It really is an edifying read. It will still go over Trump's head, but people of normal intelligence will be able to understand it and get a deeper sense of what is going on. I highly recommend reading it.",
    "The important clue was  the dog didn't bark, in a Sherlock Holmes story and also in the Biden Story.  The dog doesn't bark at danger and corruption,   not the media,  not the DOJ, not the FBI and not.   There  is a mountain of evidence about the Biden family corruption  and  the dog's ain't barking when they should as if  the media  doesn't care about Biden bribes and money funneling into the Biden family piggybanks hopscotching through  complicate LLCs like someone embezzling would do to avoid taxes and accountability.",
    "Die hard Trump supporters will never be convinced to change their minds about him.\nBut, they are not the majority of citizens in our country.\nAll you have to do is read the indictment. I read it in twenty minutes. It's very clear. Trump handled these documents, that have to do with our security, with careless disregard. Anyone visiting that club could have gained access. For a guy that crucified and demonized Hillary Clinton (who I'm no fan of), his hypocrisy is blantently obvious. It also shows how Trump behaves like a mob boss, manipulating others to do his dirty work.",
    "In fairness, It isn't really a lie to say he didn't know of anything that would make the intelligence community feel better about the file storage.\r\n\r\nBut, loyalty to a president doesn't make you forget the danger of sensitive military information being exposed.  He has an excuse for getting into this mess but at some point when you are hiding hundreds of boxes of documents from your own attorneys you have to realize you're not the good guy.  He was in the military and helping to steal and hide top secret military information that was going to be used against us and our allies.  Part of being presumed innocent is that you can always imagine a reason.  After a year long conspiracy that includes lying to the FBI AT THE END you can't really pretend he didn't know what he was doing.  He knew what he was doing, Knew how dangerous it was for the country, knew how illegal it was, continued to do it and then lied about it when he had the chance to come clean.  Any doubt about him being knowledgeable and complicit are gone.  Money and loyalty can excuse being tricked but not long term, active, thoughtful, & strategic involvement.",
    "Equally iconic were those interviews Laura Ingraham conducted where she almost tore her hair out spoon-feeding and herding Christina Bobb on those same talking points but Bobb wouldn't play or was tactless enough to have missed the hints, more like \"fireworks thrown around Bobb's face\" to catch her attention but she didn't get it.

If Russia challenges the petrodollar, starts selling energy in another currency, there will be a change in momentum, then the Dollar index may fall.\n\nThe logical continuation of Russia's actions in the global financial market, and the second blow to the American economy may be the loss of American influence on Europe. If Russia starts accepting fees for energy in the European currency, the American currency will fall to the Euro at the level of 1.5 Dollars. As a result, the exchange rate of the European currency will increase, the cost of energy will decrease, and the Europeans themselves will simply be delighted with the possibility of making payments in euros.\n\nThe third blow to American consumers, which will be a knockdown, will be that, as a result of all these changes, the cost of gasoline in America will increase by one Dollar per gallon \u2014 up to 5 \"dollars\". Since America is a country of cars, ordinary Americans will not forgive the government.\n\nWell, the fourth knockout blow will be the collapse of the US stock market. Russia holds it (naftedollar) with one hand and can react in an Instant in such a way as to cause the collapse of the Dow (the main indicator of the American market), which has not yet been the case in history.\n\nAs a result, the United States will be forced to use payments not in dollars, but in another currency, which is \"equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot\". The Russians can turn the American economy upside down and completely destroy it. You can wave the American flag as much as you want, but the fact is that they have such an opportunity.",

    "Regarding the idea of Trump pleading guilty: I'm conflicted on this idea. With everything he's gotten away with over the course of his lifetime, I think he should face harsh reality and experience justice. On the other hand, I think there's also a certain level of satisfaction to be had to hear Trump say the words \"I plead guilty, your honor\" with his own mouth for the entire world to hear. That being said, with what I know about Trump - I find it pretty unlikely his ego will allow him to plead for leniency and he'll go to trial clenching on the belief that he'll get away with it.",

He then artfully selects a SINGLE \"study\" that he can use to get himself out of a sorry hole. Thus, Fauci displays selectivity and bias yet again.

    "Wow - 0% respect for MSNBC - literally trying to shove political agenda down our throats and kissing the A** of a clearly deceptive, evil sorcerer.  You guys are on crack. I'm dumbfounded that this isn't a satirical sketch making fun of a far more subtle pair of hosts who are at least trying to cover up their clear messaging tactics. Eye rolls and smirks, and emotional catch phrases?! Hey! Dr. Fauci was told by two scientists in an email that the virus was from a lab. Fauci held a conference with them without the CDC's director's involvement or knowledge of the meeting. Those two men then said publicly, oh, we meant it was from nature.\u00a0Three months later, both received a nine million dollar grant from.........  FAUCI.  HELLO!?!?!?!?! \nFACTS. Testimonial FACTS.  And you throw obedient respect and border line adoration to this clearly exposed \"bad guy\" and then quickly shout and point \"Oh look everybody!!! That's the bad guy over THERE!!! Remember what that orange guy said about women?!  He's the bad guy!!!! Hurry! Start feeling anger towards him!!!\"  Well.

    "I was viciously verbally attacked three years ago when I said this guy is full of S***. I read a few docs and scientific suggestions down the rabbit hole before they were silenced. EVERY SINGLE thing I thought, yet rarely said three years ago has been nearly 100% accurate. I suffered conspiracy theorist labeling and politicization at every turn, lost opportunities and jobs, and was eliminated from circles.  NOW... we know, through TESTIMONY and EVIDENCE through sub-committees and HOUSE interviews that, FACTUALLY, The head of the CDC was out of the loop on several emails sent between Fauci and Dr. Anderson, and one other scientist where they wrote, in now DE-CLASSIFIED emails, that the virus was almost certainly from a lab and another that said this does not look like a natural occurrence in any way.\u00a0\nThe director of the CDC, Redfield, was specifically excluded from the thread or that those emails were even sent, despite being the head of the CDC. Then Dr. Fauci had conference hearings with both men, who cited a lab as the origin. Three days later, both men do a complete 180 and say that the virus appears to have been from nature and NOT from a lab.  Their official statement was EXACTLY OPPOSITE of the then \"private\" assessment sent in emails to DR FAUCI.  Now....  Three months later they both receive a NINE MILLION dollar grant from DR. FAUCI... nine million.  nine million. nine million.  THESE ARE FACTS we know.  If you can sit here with a serious face and ignore simply this ONE aspect of factual history when the pandemic first started... then YOU indeed care more about believing blatant evil than facing the truth that some people you dislike have been correct in their controversial belief that \"The science\" and government can't be trusted. \u00a0\nThese mind numbing imbeciles in this video actually started asking this atrocious deceitful, dare I say, evil man...   about TRUMP?!  Like hey don't you think trump said some dumb stuff, eh? huh?  don't ya think?  Like what the F is wrong with you??!!?!   No matter if you like or hate Donald Trump...   it's got NOTHING to do with the fact that YOU.. YOU DR. FAUCI are unequivocally the BAD GUY.  YOU ARE THE BAD GUY.  I knew it the moment I looked into his deceptive blank eyes when he first spoke at the jump of the lock-down...   Please people, do MILD research right here on YouTube..  This dude has been doing unthinkable evil.   Please wake up.  Don't let two parties in politics affect a simple observation of THIS MAN IS A LIAR. Mega liar...

    "FOUR facts to consider:  \n\n1. In November 2019 three Wuhan Institute of Virology scientists caught COVID-19.  No reports that they had bat-kabob down at the wet market and wandered back to the lab, as Fauci wants us to believe.  They caught it IN the lab.  \n\n2. After the outbreak, the Wuhan Institute was brought under direct control of the Chinese military.  If it came from the wet market, why would this move be necessary?  \n\n3. After the outbreak, the CCP invested $600 milllion to install a new ventilation system in the Wuhan lab.  This fact perfectly fits with the known safety deficiencies with the lab prior to the outbreak. They fixed the sub-standard ventilation after the outbreak so they wouldn't have to condemn the entire building.\n\n4. The CCP deleted the virus sequences that they were working on in the lab after the outbreak.  Most likely, this represents destroying the evidence that would reveal properties of SARS-Cov-2 showing it was engineered.",

    "When are you people going to learn what \u201cConsensus Choice\u201d is and how it functions. In consensus choice, those making the choice also provide the choices. Meaning the States make the choice by vote, 1 vote per State, and a majority of the States is necessary to the choice. So, where does the ballot that the States consider in congress come from. Well, each State has the right to make a number of nominations equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives that each State may be entitled in the Congress. This is not a national choice of only party nominees, this is a consensus choice of persons that the people of each State believe are qualified and suitable for that office, as identified and vetted by each State\u2019s electors who are an exact duplication of each State\u2019s representation in congress.\n\nSo how do we determine the whole number of representatives each State \u201cmay be entitled\u201d in the congress? Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the number they are given out of 435, the calculation is established in Article 1 Section 2 Clause 3, where the percentage of representation, suffrage, and direct taxes is determine by an enumeration which determines the percentage of the aggregate population of the country resides within each State, then that percentage must be converted into a whole number of representatives using a proportionality constant and boundary conditions to address any fractional representatives calculated when the population of each State is divided by the proportionality constant.\n\nThe federal proportionality constant is 1 representative for every 30,000 inhabitants which reside within each State; the first boundary condition is not to exceed the proportionality constant which requires that the fractional representatives calculated must be truncated because rounding up will exceed the proportionality constant; the second boundary condition is for the specific condition where the State\u2019s population is less than the proportionality constant which will only calculate a fractional representative which will be truncated by the first boundary condition leaving that state with zero representatives, and in that particular case that State is entitled to 1 representative.\n\nWhen we use this calculation the whole number of representatives calculated will be 11,021 the whole number of representatives which does not exceed 1 representative for every 30,000 persons which reside in each State. When we add the 100 Senators we will have 11,121 electors based upon the 2020 census. Since each elector has two ballots, 1 of which must be for a person that does not reside in the same state as the elector, that would give a possibility of 22,242 individual candidates identified and ranked on the aggregate list of candidates when they combine the lists of electors choices from each State. This is not a problem because no matter how many names appear on the aggregate list, only the top 5 by Article 2 Section 1, or the top 3 on the aggregate list for President and top 2 on the aggregate list for Vice President by the 12th amendment, will be considered by the States and from which the States will make the choice by vote, 1 vote per State, and a majority of all the States is necessary to the choice in all cases.\n\nNo one can declare their candidacy, run for president, win a parties nomination, choose a running mate, win popular elections in each state to win their Electoral College votes winner takes all, to win the presidency. The person elected as president must be identified by an elector and be in the top persons on the aggregate list for president when the State\u2019s lists are combined in congress, and be chosen by the States by vote, 1 vote per state, and a majority of all the States is necessary to the choice.\n\nBefore you reply I would suggest that you actually read Article 2 Section 1 and the 12th amendment to the Constitution of the United States!",

    "Yeah, Trump's response to a crisis is exactly what's needed. His response to Covid proved that, and the fact that he \"allowed\" Iran to retaliate against an American base in a foreign country after he assassinated an Iranian General in a foreign allied country shows his brilliant response. The man is an incompetent narcissist, with the impulse control and attention span of a hyperactive five year old. The truth is he's stupid, lazy, greedy, with no forethought. The only thing he's good at is appealing to racists and bigots and validating their hate. They believe his lies because they support their prejudice. He was an embarrassment to the nation internationally, and was mocked by foreign leaders. When he shoved the leader of Montenegro for a photo op, I wished he would have shoved him back. Angela Merkel should have thrown the candy back in his face when he threw it at her. Instead of a leader, he was viewed as a bully and buffoon by our allies, and a fool by our adversaries. Putin didn't respect him he used him. I believe that Trump would have used the boxes of classified and top secret information to barter for support from foreign governments in the next election.",

Traitors go to jail immediately Garland you don't let them run around for nearly 4 years making a fool of you and the DOJ.

Garland should have imprisoned him which he had the evidence and the power to do in 2021, to incarcerate him without bail until his trial and keep him off the streets never mind allow him to go on the Presidential Campaign Trail. Garland has been the best campaign manager Trump could have ever prayed for. Trump now has just edged ahead of Biden in the Polls. Good job Merrick.

In 1897 this movement, led by a European journalist named Theodor , coalesced in the First Zionist Congress, held in Basle, Switzerland, which established the World Zionist Organization, representing 117 groups the first year; 900 the next.\n\nWhile Zionists considered such places as Argentina, Uganda, the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, and Texas, they eventually settled on Palestine for the location of their proposed Jewish State, even though Palestine was already inhabited by a population that was 93-96 percent non-Jewish. The best analysis says the population was 96% Muslims and Christians, who owned 99% of the land.\n\nAfter the Zionist Congress, Vienna's rabbis sent two of their number to explore Palestine as a possible Jewish state. These rabbis recognized the obstacle that Palestinians presented to the plan, writing home: \"The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man.\" Still, Zionists ultimately pushed forward. Numerous Zionist diary entries, letters, and other documents show that they decided to push out these non-Jews \u2013 financially, if possible; violently if necessary.\n\nProminent author on Jewish history Naomi Cohen, wrote in 2003; \"but for the financial support and political pressure of American Jews... Israel might not have been born in 1948.\"\n\nGroups advocating the setting up of a Jewish state had first begun popping up around the United States in the 1880s",

    "Why the United States and Europe Need Each Other\r\n\r\nThe United States and Europe are two of the most powerful and influential regions in the world. They have a long history of cooperation and shared interests.\r\n\r\nThe United States Needs NATO and Europe\r\n\r\nThe United States is a global power with interests around the world. It is committed to upholding the international order, which is based on democracy and the rule of law.\r\n\r\nEurope is a key partner for the United States in this goal. Europe is a democratic region with a strong economy. It is also a key ally of the United States in the fight against terrorism and other threats.\r\n\r\nThe United States needs NATO and Europe to protect its own interests. NATO provides the United States with a strong military presence in Europe, which helps to deter aggression from Russia and China. The alliance also provides the United States with intelligence sharing and other forms of support that are vital to its national security.\r\n\r\nEurope Needs the United States\r\n\r\nEurope is a continent with a long history of war and conflict. In recent decades, however, Europe has taken a number of steps to increase its security, including the founding of the European Union and NATO.\r\n\r\nDespite these measures, Europe is still vulnerable to military threats. Russia is a large country with a strong military, and it has shown a willingness to use military force in the past to achieve its goals. China is another country with a growing military power, and it has expanded its interests in Europe.\r\n\r\nEurope needs the United States to protect its security. The United States is a strong military power that is committed to defending Europe. NATO provides Europe with a common defense umbrella that protects it from Russian and Chinese aggression.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the United States and Europe need each other for a number of reasons. They share common values and interests, and they are both committed to upholding the international order.\r\n\r\nHybrid Warfare and its Impact on the United States\r\n\r\nHybrid warfare is a term used to describe a range of tactics used to undermine the stability and security of a country. These tactics can include military, economic, political, and social elements.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, hybrid warfare has increased in recent years. This is partly due to the efforts of Russia to undermine the democracy and security of the United States.\r\n\r\nOne of Russia's main tactics is disinformation. Russia spreads false or misleading information about the United States to influence public opinion and sow division. This is done through a variety of channels, including social media, news websites, and traditional media.\r\n\r\nOne example of Russian disinformation is the claim that the United States was involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This claim was spread by Russian state media and has led to an increase in COVID-19 conspiracy theories in the United States.\r\n\r\nAnother Russian tactic is economic sanctions. Russia has imposed economic sanctions on the United States and its allies to weaken them and influence their policies. These sanctions have led to an increase in inflation and unemployment in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Russia has attempted to undermine American democracy by interfering in elections in the United States. In 2016, Russia was accused of interfering in the elections by launching social media campaigns in support of Donald Trump and stealing data from Democrats.\r\n\r\nTrump's role in Russian disinformation and interference is disputed. Some experts believe that he either intentionally or unintentionally supported Russian efforts. Others believe that he simply did not do enough to prevent Russian activities.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether Trump was directly involved in Russian disinformation and interference, it is clear that these activities have damaged the United States. They have contributed to the division of the country and the weakening of democracy.\r\n\r\nImpacts of hybrid warfare on Americans\r\n\r\nHybrid warfare has a number of negative impacts on Americans. These include:\r\n\r\nReduced trust in government: Disinformation and interference in elections can lead to Americans losing trust in the government. This can lead to a weakening of democracy.\r\nSocial division: Disinformation and propaganda can contribute to social division. This can lead to conflict and violence.\r\nEconomic damage: Economic sanctions can lead to job losses, inflation, and other economic problems. This can impact the quality of life for Americans.\r\nThreat to agents: Hybrid warfare can also pose a threat to agents of the US intelligence community. In 2023, at least seven CIA agents were killed in a series of attacks carried out by foreign intelligence or terrorist groups.\r\nWhat can be done to counter hybrid warfare?\r\n\r\nIt is important to be aware of the dangers of hybrid warfare and to take steps to protect yourself from it. These include:\r\n\r\nInformation literacy: People need to learn how to identify and evaluate disinformation.\r\nCritical thinking: People need to learn to think critically and not be influenced by propaganda.\r\nStrengthening democracy: Democracies need to become stronger to defend themselves against disinformation and interference.\r\nProtecting agents: The government needs to take steps to protect its agents from threats.\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nHybrid warfare is a threat to the national security of the United States. It can be carried out through a range of tactics, including disinformation, economic sanctions, and interference in elections. These tactics can lead to Americans losing trust in the government, dividing the society, and damaging the economy.\r\n\r\nIt is important to be aware of the dangers of hybrid warfare and to take steps to protect yourself from it.\r\n\r\nHow Hybrid Warfare Hurts Americans and What Donald Trump Has to Do With It\r\n\r\nHybrid warfare is a term used to describe a range of tactics used to undermine the stability and security of a country. These tactics can include military, economic, political, and social elements.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, hybrid warfare has increased in recent years. This is partly due to the efforts of Russia to undermine the democracy and security of the United States.\r\n\r\nOne of Russia's main tactics is disinformation.

Some experts believe that he either knowingly or unknowingly aided Russian efforts. Others believe that he simply did not do enough to prevent Russian activity.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether Trump was directly involved in Russian disinformation and interference, it is clear that these activities have harmed the United States. They have contributed to the division of the country and the weakening of democracy.\r\n\r\nHere are some specific examples of how hybrid warfare hurts Americans:\r\n\r\nDisinformation can lead people to believe false information about important issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or US elections. This can lead to bad decisions that can harm people's health and well-being.\r\nEconomic sanctions can lead to job losses, inflation, and other economic problems. This can harm people's quality of life.\r\nInterference in elections can lead to unqualified or unfit people gaining power. This can lead to poor government decisions and a decrease in democracy.\r\nIt is important to be aware of the dangers of hybrid warfare and to take steps to protect yourself from it. This includes countering disinformation, educating people about the effects of economic sanctions, and strengthening election security.\r\n\r\nSpecific examples of how Trump was involved in Russian disinformation and interference\r\n\r\nTrump has been accused of a number of specific actions that aided Russian disinformation and interference in the 2016 election. These include:\r\n\r\nRepeatedly attacking the credibility of the US intelligence community, which concluded that Russia interfered in the election.\r\nFiring FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into Russian interference.\r\nMeeting with Russian officials at the Trump Tower in June 2016, during which he reportedly discussed campaign-related issues.\r\nConcealing details about his contacts with Russia during the campaign.\r\nThese actions have led to calls for Trump to be impeached and removed from office. They have also damaged the public's trust in American democracy.\r\n\r\nLove from me : Andi from Germany",

Well it is DEAD, what we have is the party of the Undead now, actively working to spread chaos and disorder so they can blame Democrats for it.  Trump is not the only one, that much is for sure.  If you need another analogy, think of a basket of apples with a half dozen rotten ones in the middle of the basket, not getting sorted out and spreading their decay to the good ones.

Run on a second Republican list, under the name \"True Republicans for USA\" or whatever, completely fully and intentionally to destroy the Republican party. That's the only way out.\n\nOnce the Republican party basically can not win any more, the Democrats will immediately split into a liberal-conservative Biden/Clinton party and a social-democratic AOC/Sanders party, and the reasonable Republicans can go to the liberal-conservative party. \n\nThat's the only way to save USA, unless Trump suddenly hits himself in the head with a golf club or something.",

    "Trump lost over 2 million jobs and had one of the highest unemployment rates since the Great depression, and it wasn't his policies but Obama's policies that were responsible for the economic growth under Trump. The current inflation is much higher than it would have been had Trump not lost two economic trade wars, and had his Steel tariffs backfire causing the price of steel to skyrocket, and the price of steel affects everything. His tariffs on produce also backfired causing the cost of foods like rice to rise dramatically as well, the current inflation is partially 45's doing, we would have had inflation but not this bad. As for the high gas prices you can thank the oil executives like Rex Tillerson price gouging due to Republican deregulation. And Putin. And a global pandemic- which caused most of the inflation around the globe.\n\nTell me exactly what policies Biden put in place that caused a supply shortage across the world? And what policies caused prices to rise? I know Trump's policies caused prices to raise due to his tariffs, car prices pushed up by the semiconductor shortages trump caused, steel tariffs 25%, aluminium 25%, lumber 25%, beer, soda, soup, candy, and pretty much anything that goes in a foil wrap or can, farm machinery, poultry incubators, dairy equipment, medical equipment, new homes, nails and screws, equipment required by oil and gas companies. The list is endless and all of that adds a virtual tax to every American. So what did Biden do that caused increased prices and worldwide shortages?",

    "Biden is the most dangerous president for the USA. Although he is a cowardly war criminal, he is about to create WW3, which no one knows its impact on the uSA and the world. Biden tries to achieve a victory on any war possible after his historical defeat in Afghanistan. His search for a war will force him to pick what is available, and this may create a calamity for the USA. His NeoNazi Zionist Colonial ideology is a necessary condition for wars against humanity. The USA area of influence has been shrinking after Biden was elected. He has failed his voters and the world and has been defeated by Putin very badly. Biden is a corrupted man and his corruption with his war mongering make a real dangerous president. He is as dangerous as Hitker.",

Donald Trump should be admitted in a psychiatric ward for the criminally insane.......and unfortunately there is a large part of the American population that either should be admitted with him or are just plain ignorant and foolish.

    "To answer the question, you've got to ask yourself just how much do the fundamentalist Christians who dominate the GOP hate the very concept of democracy.  I'd say, they hate it very very much.  Therefore, I rate the probability of the Republicans nominating Trump as very high.  They don't give a rap about good governance or virtue.  All they care about is the destruction of planet Earth so that Jesus will come back.  They hate the very concept of government in the first place because they'd rather have the High Priest run things.  And Big Business is right there with them, urging things along, because they want the elimination of all taxes and all regulation on health and safety, as well as the destruction of all unions.",
    "Do you want to know why the republicans let trump get away with all this stuff? I know do you want to know?

That\u2019s dear you see in their faces when you confront them on why they don\u2019t condemn him. They twist themselves into pretzels and go out of their way not to offend their Fuhrar. Chris Christie and Liz Cheney and Adam Kinszinger and a small few others are the ONLY republicans left with any balls with any guts whatsoever. Do you want to see a man who is truly gutless and has no spine? Take a look down in Houston Texas at Senators Ted Cruz. I don\u2019t know how he is able to stand up straight without a spine.

    "Robert De Niro\u2019s full statement on Trump. Please read and let me know your thoughts:\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time studying bad men.\u00a0 I\u2019ve examined their characteristics, their mannerisms, the utter banality of their cruelty. Yet there\u2019s something different about Donald Trump. When I look at him, I don\u2019t see a bad man. Truly. \n\nI see an evil one. \n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve met gangsters here and there. This guy tries to be one, but he can\u2019t quite pull it off. There\u2019s such a thing as \u201chonor among thieves.\u201d Yes, even criminals usually have a sense of right and wrong.\u00a0 Whether they do the right thing or not is a different story \u2014 but \u2014 they have a moral code, however warped.\n\nDonald Trump does not. He\u2019s a wannabe tough guy with no morals or ethics. No sense of right or wrong. No regard for\u00a0anyone\u00a0but himself \u2014 not the people he was supposed to lead and protect, not the people he does business with, not the people who follow him, blindly and loyally, not even the people who consider themselves his \u201cfriends.\u201d He has contempt for all of them.\n\nWe New Yorkers got to know him over the years that he poisoned the atmosphere and littered our city with monuments to his ego.\u00a0 We knew first hand that this was someone who should never be considered for leadership.\u00a0 We tried to warn the world in 2016.\n\nThe repercussions of his turbulent presidency divided America and rattled New York City beyond imagination.\u00a0 Remember how we were jolted by crisis in early 2020, as a virus swept the world. We lived with Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0bombastic behavior\u00a0every day on the national stage, and we suffered as we saw our neighbors piling up in\u00a0body bags. \nThe man who was supposed to protect this country put it in peril, because of his recklessness and impulsiveness. It was like an abusive father ruling the family by fear and violent behavior.\u00a0 That was the consequence of New York\u2019s warning getting ignored. Next time, we know it will be worse.\n\nMake no mistake: the twice-impeached, 4-time indicted Donald Trump is still a fool. But we can\u2019t let our fellow Americans write him off like one. Evil thrives in the shadow of dismissive mockery, which is why we must take the danger of Donald Trump very seriously.\nSo today we issue another warning. From this place where Abraham Lincoln spoke \u2014 right here in the beating heart of New York \u2014 to the rest of America: \nThis is our last chance.\n\nDemocracy won\u2019t survive the return of a wannabe dictator.\n\nAnd it won\u2019t overcome evil if we are divided.\n\nSo what do we do about it?\u00a0 I know I\u2019m preaching to the choir here.\u00a0 What we\u2019re doing today is valuable, but we have to take today into tomorrow \u2013 take it outside these walls. \u00a0 We have to reach out to the half of our country who have ignored the hazards of Trump and, for whatever reason, support elevating him back into the White House.\u00a0 They\u2019re not stupid, and we must not condemn them for making a stupid choice.\u00a0 Our future doesn\u2019t just depend on us. It depends on them.\n\nLet\u2019s reach out to Trump\u2019s followers with respect.\u00a0 Let\u2019s not talk about \u201cdemocracy.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cDemocracy\u201d may be our holy grail, but to others it is just a word, a concept, and in their embrace of Trump, they\u2019ve already turned their backs on it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about right and wrong.\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about humanity.\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about kindness.\u00a0 Security for our world.\u00a0 Safety for our families.\u00a0 Decency.\u00a0 Let\u2019s welcome them back.\u00a0 We won\u2019t get them all, but we can get enough to end the nightmare of Trump, and fulfill the mission of this \u201cStop Trump Summit.\u201d",

    "Nothing But the Truth: What Happens When Someone Lies Under Oath\nJuries and judges often base their verdicts, sentences, or other important decisions on sworn testimony and signed documents. Statements given under oath and certain legal documents are presumed to be truthful or at least made in good faith. But how can anyone know for sure that witnesses and other parties involved in a legal matter are telling the truth? It is not always possible to be certain, but those who are caught knowingly misleading a court face serious criminal charges of perjury.\n\nThis article provides a general overview of perjury.\n\nWhat is Perjury?\nTo \u201cperjure oneself\" is to knowingly make misleading or false statements under oath or to sign a legal document known to be false or misleading. This crime is taken very seriously because the foundation of the legal system depends on trust and credibility. After all, just one sworn statement has the power to tip the scales of justice and dramatically alter a person's life.\n\nPerjury is considered a crime against justice since lying under oath compromises the authority of courts, grand juries, governing bodies, and public officials. Other crimes against justice include criminal contempt of court, probation violation, and tampering with evidence",

They just watch Fox News (shamefully run by one of our Australian corrupt Billionaires ... Rupert Murdoch and his elder son, Lachlan). Rupert and Lachlan are just in it for the money, so they broadcast to the gullible what they want to hear (hatred, guns, evil is coming, fight for your life, etc) ... and they're laughing all the way to the bank.",

You news reporters keep expressing outrage about his failure to resign, but you're missing the point",
    "The constituents of District 3 on Long Island, NY have no one to fight for them for at least the next 2 years.  Santos probably never intended to actually be a representation.  His remarks make me think that his plan has been to serve as short a term as \npossible and leave government with a pension/salary for life as well as a spectacularly good health plan.  Pretty sly grift.  Is \nthis what the government has become?  Is democracy doomed for us?  Thanks Donald.",

The U.S.A. will have to revise its Constitution, Laws and Democratic Process and install serious fail-Safe against this type of infiltration. In this new era of media and communication, the old way of the American democratic process proved to be too easy to be derailed by extremists, liars, or even foreign or domestic enemies.

Because of the complete absence of any law and order from the spineless AG Merrick Garland and the right wing controlled farce Department of Justice, with no fraud charges being levied against Santos and others for their attempts to defraud the Federal Government with fake electors, I am guessing we will see 10% interest rates and higher in the very near future unless some bombshell criminal charges are announced soon.",

The media has been reporting on Trump's lies and deception for years, even uncovering past lies and deception that go back decades.

Santos's well documented lies and deception and piled on top of more lies and deception haven't moved the needle an inch in terms of his accountability. The end justifies the means.The media does its job, and the new norm of lies and deception piled onto more lies and deception continues, because it is politically expedient for all the lies and deception to be overlooked, and otherwise excused and rationalized by a political party that should know better, but refuses to act. If we ever wondered why our schools are often the undisciplined hellzapoppin messes many have become ... it's because so many of the adults are missing in action ... missing in action, gaining political power by looking the other way, and never disciplining those whose egregious lies and deceptions got them into office, and whose very presence and votes they stand to benefit politically. Farce has become the new norm. Cheap, transparent, unaccountable, old-boys-club farce. The party of law and order is a hypocritical mess of expedience and cowardice ... The new norm ... and all the reporting by the media hasn't changed the outcome. it is simply recording the pathetic history of the new norm.",

    "Reforming the federal courts:  1.  Ethics codes must have meaningful penalties that are enforced by an independent oversight body.   Those penalties should include fines, required recusals from certain cases, and, in the case of a repeat offender like Thomas, demotion to a lower court under close supervision.  2.  Change the process of selecting nominees.  No outside partisan body like the Federalist Society should have any input.  The American Bar Association already reviews and rates each nominee.  They should be given funding to establish a committee of 100 senior members from which 5 will be randomly selected each time a position on a federal court is available.  They will prepare a short list of 7 candidates who are fully qualified and have a history of political independence.  The President may nominate any candidate on the list.  3.  Expand SCOTUS to 13 Justices, one for each circuit.  3.  Judges and Justices should serve terms of 11 years in any one court before being rotated to a different court.   That would mean having judges on the Federal Appeals Court who also qualify to be Justices who can be moved up when a Justice moves down to be a Judge.   4.  Age limits: Part of the qualifications the ABA already looks at is enough experience in various positions to be promoted.  They rated ACB as Unqualified, their lowest rating, but Trump and McConnell shoved her through anyway.  That puts \u00e0 roughly lower age limit on judges of various ranks.  However, people who work in insular workplaces tend lose touch with other people\u2019s realities, and older people tend to do so too.   Judges and Justices must resign at 75.

    "*Biden second-quarter job numbers off by 1 million, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank says*\r\nDec 16, 2022  The WASHINGTON TIMES\r\n\r\n*The Biden administration vastly overstated its estimate that employers created more than 1 million jobs in the second quarter of this year, claiming historic job growth when in fact hiring had stalled, according to a new estimate.*\r\n\r\nJob growth was \u201cessentially flat\u201d in the second quarter with only 10,500 jobs added, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said.\r\n\r\nRepublicans are accusing the administration of lying about the employment data in an election year and are demanding answers.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia Fed\u2019s new assessment shows that employment numbers in 29 states and the District of Columbia were significantly lower than the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported for the March-through-June period.\r\n\r\nThe BLS, a division of the Department of Labor, estimated net job growth of 1,047,000 jobs in the second quarter. The Philadelphia Fed now says its data shows that 10,500 net jobs were created in that period.\r\n\r\nRepublican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida called the development \u201coutrageous.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWrong by a million jobs,\u201d Mr. Scott tweeted Friday. \u201c@JoeBiden\u2019s admin has been lying to the American people about our economy to prop up his failed agenda & I won\u2019t stand for it. I\u2019m requesting an immediate meeting with the head of @BLS_gov.

The strength of the labor market, along with other economic indicators, is not what we generally see in a recession or even a pre-recession. The drop in unemployment all around the country is a sign of enormous progress, and puts the U.S. in a better position to fight the global challenges of inflation.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn Friday, a White House spokesman told The Washington Times, \u201cWe monitor a range of labor market and economic activity data closely and the totality of the data suggest a solid labor market, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low and initial unemployment insurance claims remaining low. These trends are consistent with historically strong job growth under President Biden.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia Fed said its job estimates are better because they \u201cincorporate more comprehensive, accurate job estimates released by the BLS as part of its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program,\u201d rather than the BLS\u2019 less reliable monthly reporting of data.\r\n\r\nLooking at specific states in its region, the Philadelphia Fed said job growth in Pennsylvania for the second quarter was \u201cessentially flat,\u201d while the BLS had reported job growth of 2.9%.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey, payroll jobs fell 1.2% in the second quarter, instead of the 3.4% growth reported by the BLS.\r\n\r\nIn the president\u2019s home state of Delaware, payroll jobs fell by 4.1%, rather than the 4.5% growth reported by the BLS.",

    "Let's keep in mind, the majority of people who use Obamacare are either unemployed, students, retired or self employed, with a small amount of people who don't receive benefits through their job. Most unemployed people receive Medicaid, unless they opt out and go for aca plan, most students are likely on a parents plan, but if they aren't then probably ACA plan. And a majority of retirees go on Medicare early, or some companies have a retiree plan. so that leaves mostly self employed people who don't have those options. Generally speaking, those who are self employed tend to be more conservative. So basically the states with the most conservative self employed business owners, happen to also have the most people who need health insurance outside of a group health plan. I literally sell insurance to self employed people. We don't market to people working a job with company insurance we market to people that are self employed or independent contractors.

    "Whom Can We Trust If No One Is Trustworthy?\r\nOne of my favorite quips from Mark Twain\u2019s The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is when Tom is defined as \u201ca glittering hero\u2026the pet of the old, the envy of the young,\u201d and there were \u201csome that believed that he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.\u201d With these few words, Twain captured the essence of leadership in our world. Those who get to the top are the fiercest, most determined, and most ruthless. Today, the latter quality has become so intense that we can no longer believe our leaders, and certainly not trust them to have our best interest in mind.\r\nI am not accusing any leader in particular, or even leaders as a whole. It is simply that in an egoistic world, where people vie to topple one another on their way to the top, the one at the top is clearly the one who trampled over and knocked down more people than anyone else. Concisely, to get to the top in an egoistic world you have to be the biggest egoist.\r\nSo how do we know whom to trust? We don\u2019t know and we cannot know. All we know is that we are in the dark.\r\nIn a culture of unhinged selfishness, any conspiracy theory seems reasonable, while truth is nowhere to be found. When every person who says or writes something is trying to promote some hidden agenda, you have no way of knowing who is right, what really happened, or if anything happened at all.\r\nThe only way to get some clarity in the news and goodwill from our leaders is to say \u201cEnough!\u201d to our current system and build something entirely independent. The guiding principle of such a system should be \u201cinformation only,\u201d no commentary. Commentary means that information has already been skewed. Information means saying only what happened, as much as possible, not why, and not who is to blame and who we should praise.\r\nConcurrently, we must begin a comprehensive process of self-teaching. We have to know not only what is happening, but why we skew and distort everything. In other words, we have to know about human nature and how it inherently presents matters according to its own subjective view, which caters to one\u2019s own interest. To \u201cclear\u201d ourselves from that deformity, we must learn how to rise above our personal interest and develop an equally favorable attitude toward others. This is our only guarantee that our interpretation of things will be even and correct.\r\nOnce we achieve such an attitude, we will discover that the bad things we see in our world reflect our own, internal wickedness. Our ill-will toward others creates a world where ill-will governs, and so the world is filled with wickedness and cruelty. Therefore, all we need in order to create positive leadership\u2014and to generally eliminate ill-will from the world\u2014is to generate goodwill within us. When we nurture goodwill toward others, we will fill the world with goodwill. As a result, the world will fill with kindness and compassion. By changing ourselves, we will create a world that is opposite from the world we have created through our desires to govern, patronize, and often destroy other people.",

    "It's amazing how gullible we are as Americans. No one even knows for sure if the default would have been as bad as people were PREDICTING. A prediction is not a certainty, regardless of what stats you think you have. But what this doom and gloom forecast did was push Biden and Dems to concede on items that were once NEVER up for debate. Which may have been the plan the ENTIRE time. (I will acknowledge that this is an opinion and not a fact for certain) \n\nWhat is NOW certain is that people in West Virginia WILL have their land seized by the government on behalf of a multibillion dollar company to build an oil pipeline. This company will get to skip over normal regulatory processes thanks to this bill. What is CERTAIN is that billions of dollars once promised to IRS enforcement is now being taken away, which means they are in a weaker position to go after the wealthy and corporate tax cheats. What is CERTAIN is that people on SNAP who ALREADY had work requirements, will have additional ones. And the reason Biden got a two year extension on the next debt ceiling deadline was because he agreed to spending caps. The GOP didn't just give that to him for nothing. \n\nEveryone should be concerned because if the Dems were willing to concede on these once held \"non negotiables\" then Social Security and Medicare are most certainly in future danger to be on the chopping block.

IF they were really concerned about all these suddenly \u2018important\u2019 issues, why wait until the 11th hour to write a bill, why not write it two months ago, debate it in a normal, regular session?

OMGEEE! The regurgitater meter just jumped 10 points!! Get out the boots and waders!! IF they really were concerned with passing the bill they would pass it post haste, KNOWING to delay the vote or not passing meant default. Default isn\u2019t just about sticking it to the libs, or seeing vulnerable groups suffer, it\u2019s about not paying bills ALREADY INCURRED and not honoring previously agreed deadlines NOT just for US concerns/loans but for international loans and deadlines. The last time we came close to default and it wasn\u2019t as close as this time, was in 2008 and it literally affected our GLOBAL credit rating and changed the terms of financial agreements, you know the usual consequences when you fail to meet your fiscal responsibilities. IF they really were concerned with taxing people, they wouldn\u2019t have passed the TCJA in 2017 that added $4.3T to the national debt.

Conservatives and business groups have long objected to youth employment restrictions, and they know weakening child labor laws will also threaten other workplace regulations, as well as keeping wages unreasonably low for all workers.

    "Biden effectively out-negotiated the Republicans, agreeing to small, near-term concessions in exchange for preserving a litany of major economic investments that make up the core of his case for reelection. He also got spending capped for the next 2 years including miliary spending, which was huge, instead of the enormous cuts Republicans wanted to everything except the military, which they wanted even more funding for, but didnt get any of it. Biden and Dems traded adding work requirements and raising the age from 49 to 54 for Govt assistance for single people without dependents (very few of whom qualify anyway), with NO work requirement AND an increase in coverage for all homeless and all veterans. \nAlso, the debt ceiling won\u2019t need to be negotiated again until after Biden\u2019s name is on the ballot one final time \u2014 effectively removing the main leverage point Republicans had before the next election, now it's off the table until 2025. Dems weren't going to add anything more to their gains for the rest of this Congress anyway, since they dont control the House. Biden and Dems took Republicans to school in these negotiations, which some argue should never have been agreed to, but those people just cant accept the reality of divided Govt and Dems not having control of the House, and only the Senate by one vote.

    "11:00 that entropy was the result of selfish motives united toward no common values when \"conservative\" was understood to \"conserve\" that sense of (moral) values (since Edmund Burke).  Then those same media respond to the entropy by seizing the left for the content of its \"message\" in order to profit from populism, not statecraft. \n\nConaider, for ezample how American media served the Saudi Royal Family's public relations-interests when the Crown Prince was designated as the King's spokesman when MAGA was fresh for the White House.  The interests were therefore global where MAGA implied a more provincial perspective--and see what happened to the Public Relations/Political factors when Khasshogi was murdered. The pattern doesn't repeat itself entirely; it evolves out of the back rooms into the uses (not the valuyes) of morality for Fox News (think Monica's dress not Stormy's  NDA)..\n\nThat pattern seems to explain for me why Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh may be disposable for those media interests. As the medium devolves into a completely reactionary approach to translating current events into professional journalism, the matter loses relation to the public in the nature of ordinary lives.  The pattern may well end where the global interests have excluded local problems from that \"programming\" in favor of reacting--not reasoning--=against the other party for power, lacking any opposite perspective about government.  The left failed to realize how long ago the right stopped listening in order to weave their \"narrative\" of politics in a way that absolves the wealthy of any responsibility for politics, then used nedua  to engage other factions by deceit, for whatever reason.  Just don't contradict a postulated need to defend tax shelters in a process of insisting on a military empire made of subcontract law, then budget federal authority for military authority, not police jurisdiction, so that states-rights grounds of argument are free to  distort  the  emergence of fascism through \"expert\" constitutional interpretations.\n\nPerhaps the current state of Conservative Media has reached the same crisis that brought Lenin his path to sovereign power by making the population forget that \"democracy\" means government by the majority, not merely by the mob.  There's a system that goes with the distinct values, which is nihilism for the motives toward anarchy, including the \"get the government off my back\" demand of most successful capitalists. They won't need the schools and roads as soon as they retire to  gated community, safe against the left (whatever that means lately).",

Let's keep up the good work. =)\n\n\"Past examples of successful defeat of verification reversal by politicians have involved various methods, including:\r\n\r\nFact-checking and evidence-based rebuttals: Independent fact-checkers, journalists, and experts have played a crucial role in debunking false claims made by politicians. By providing verifiable evidence and presenting factual information, they can challenge and counteract deceptive tactics.\r\nExample: During the 2020 U.S. presidential election, numerous fact-checkers and media organizations extensively debunked false claims related to voter fraud, which helped to clarify misinformation and prevent its widespread acceptance.\r\n\r\nTransparency and disclosure: Demanding transparency and accountability from politicians can help defeat verification reversal. Requiring politicians to disclose their sources of information, provide evidence for their claims, and be transparent about their motives and biases can highlight potential deception and create public awareness.\r\nExample: In the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, investigative journalism, legal investigations, and demands for transparency exposed the deceptive actions of politicians involved in the scandal, leading to resignations, indictments, and significant consequences.\r\n\r\nIndependent investigations and inquiries: Independent investigations conducted by non-partisan bodies or commissions can uncover the truth and provide evidence-based findings, reducing the impact of verification reversal by politicians.\r\nExample: The 9/11 Commission Report in the United States, which conducted an independent investigation into the September 11th attacks, provided a comprehensive analysis of the events and debunked conspiracy theories, helping to counteract misinformation and deception.\r\n\r\nPublic engagement and awareness: Educating the public about critical thinking, media literacy, and the tactics used by politicians can empower individuals to question and verify information, reducing the effectiveness of verification reversal.\r\nExample: In various instances of political propaganda and disinformation campaigns, public awareness and vigilance, including grassroots movements, social media activism, and community mobilization, have helped to expose deceptive tactics and prevent the spread of misinformation.\r\n\r\nCollaboration and cross-validation: Collaborative efforts among different stakeholders, such as journalists, fact-checkers, experts, and the public, can enhance the verification of information and provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment.\r\nExample: The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) collaborated with journalists from around the world to uncover the Panama Papers scandal in 2016, which exposed widespread tax evasion and corruption by politicians and elites, using cross-validation of evidence and information to verify the claims made.\r\n\r\nOverall, defeating verification reversal by politicians often involves a combination of evidence-based rebuttals, transparency, independent investigations, public engagement, and collaboration among different stakeholders to uncover the truth, promote critical thinking, and hold politicians accountable for their deceptive tactics.\"",

Whoever supports those things the most with the most power are ultimately responsible. What group of Americans can you say that about. The only possible solution is to take the 40% of that group who don't believe in those things any longer and coalesce around truth and justice, and wait until 2040 when things can possibly be set right.

    "All five were Cancer's on Society...and that they're gone does my heart good. It's one thing to be Conservative, which is or has a history of social demagoguery and it's support of keeping down those it hates, but be that as it may society never needed them because they did not apply their efforts to join the diversity of Nations and Nationalities into a cohesive whole. Their goal was always divide and concur. The \"Conservative\" has one goal, keeping you, no matter who you are, in your place. That place is the classifying, categorizing, and ruling you. The Conservative and their beliefs exist still to this day in it's founding from the utterance of the word itself. The word was termed over a thousand years ago in the time when Kings and or the Clergy were the Ruler's, the Warriors were the enforcers the tax collector's and those responsible for carrying out the edicts of the Ruler's, then lastly we come to the average citizen, the Surf's. This has never changed to this day. And for them money comes from the bottom up never ever from the top down. The Term and its consequences have even in the past, which it was quoted, tried and failed as it would never succeed is Trickle Down Theory, a malicious act designed by Conservatives to help, supposedly, the average citizen. It didn't work then and it has not worked in the past and we know how well it's worked in recent years. The History of Conservatives and those of their ilk today espouse their position as for the Working Man and as historical records of Financial History show, it is a total and utter lie. The French Economist, Thomas Picketty, in I think the early 2000's went through the entirety of Conservative Financial historical records looking for the Proof that Conservative continual drone on about  how the Rich Conservative Elite are Job creators of Nations. FYI, the Historical Financial Records prove beyond a doubt that is an utter lie, a fiction made up to appease the masses.

Conservativism has left the republican party.

It's way past time to stop calling them conservatives... the only way we keep this republic is to get real and say what's really happening like Joe Biden attempted to do, but didn't quite get there. Because they aren't sort of fascists... but full blown Fascists and they are actively checking off all the fascist boxes by...  emphasizing extreme nationalism, militarism, and want the supremacy of both the nation and a single, powerful leader over the individual citizen.

But, the bigger picture is that all pundits have experienced less reach as more outlets exist today than back in 1936.

I won't lie, it took a bit of time to adapt (I 100% support her, but just going from one name to another for someone you've known your entire life isn't easy), but at the end of the day, I wish her nothing but happiness and if I can wish that to a member of my family with whom I've had a very complicated relationship, I don't see why random strangers make it a point to go on a crusade against her or any other transgender individuals. She knew full well that she was going to have to endure hate coming from loved ones (fortunately that part didn't really happen) as well as complete strangers (unfortunately, that part keeps happening on a weekly basis). Just think about this, what do you have to gain from coming out as transgender if you know that a bunch of complete strangers are going to make a point of hating you? Doesn't it show how sincere transgender people are? What the f**k do they have to gain except finally feeling like they can be who they truly feel they are? Who are we to tell them \"Nah, you don't have the right to do that\"? Is it so hard to imagine that someone feels like they identify more with a different gender than the one they were biologically assigned at birth? How is it suppose to affect my life or yours? Can't we let people just take the decisions they want to take and do the best they can to be happy?

Why do so many of us insist on telling other people what they should and shouldn't do? As long as it's not hurting anyone else, what's the problem? How are transgender people hurting other people?",

In this system, the ego makes us think and act without considering ourselves as parts of a whole system.\n\nProblems and crises proliferate in our world when our egoistic approach to life continues growing, coupled with us becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent.\n\nOn the contrary, if we think and act for the benefit of the whole system, where we consider the benefit of others and nature in our every move, then we will enter into balance with nature.\n\nWhen we reach balance with nature, we will experience a major upgrade in life: from a life of increasing problems and crises, to a life of harmony and peace.",

    "It's frustrating that mental health institutions are not given the importance they deserve. The Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 (MHSA) was signed by President Jimmy Carter to provide grants to community mental health centers. However, in 1981, President Ronald Reagan reduced funding for mental institutions, repealing most of the act. This was a significant setback for mental healthcare policy.\n\nThe closure of state psychiatric hospitals has led to an increase in incarceration of people with mental illness. In the event of a mental health crisis, peace officers often respond to the 911 call instead of a therapist, social worker, or psychiatrist. But most officers aren't trained to handle mental health emergencies, and while laws protect civil liberties, it's challenging to hospitalize people against their will. As a result, policing and incarceration have replaced emergency mental health care. Currently, nearly half of the people in U.S. jails and over a third of those in U.S. prisons have been diagnosed with a mental illness, compared to about a fifth in the general population.\n\nThe justice system's intervention in mental health care has often resulted in fatalities. According to statistics, almost one-quarter of fatal police shootings involve people with mental illness. Mental health care in jails or prisons is usually inadequate or abusive. Jails and prisons have now become the new asylums.\n\nThe transfer of mentally disabled people from psychiatric hospitals back to their families or community in the 1950s is responsible for the deinstitutionalization movement. The closure of hospitals resulted in patients being discharged without appropriate psychiatric care. Consequently, people in need of care were left to roam the streets and live among the general public. \n\nCommon sense suggests that if more community mental-health hospitals were built, there would be fewer mentally ill individuals on the streets and living amongst the general population.",

Return America economically, legally and socially to c.1955 ... No more Civil Rights Act, no more Voting Rights Act, the Jim Crow Laws all alive and well ... Plus Lynching is no longer a hate crime!! \n\nLook at the country that America was in the mid 50's with it's McCarthyism, race hate and legal race segregation \u2026.

    "The benefits to being sold into slavery is it led to them being free people. If they were to stay in Africa, their ancestors would have stayed as slaves in the  country  that  sold them into slavery in the first place  and their decedents would not be here to experience their first amendment  rights to discuss the subject of slavery. And as slaves in the colonies and in the young United States, their quality of life was still much better than it would have been if they stayed as slaves in Africa. There were laws protecting the slaves in our country from abuse. They did not stop slaves from being abused, but at least the laws were there. The same was not true in Africa where slaves had no rights, other than to submit to anything and everything. So being sold into slavery in our country definitely had its benefits for those that were slaves in Africa before being sold. My white ancestors on my father's side, of whom came to this country as  bond slaves in or around 1650, saw the benefits in it as well, as did my Irish ancestors on my mother's side.",

They are nit picking a great curriculum that he had no hand in.  You can change the phrasing but it will still mean the same.  Some black slaves used the skills they learned to make a living.  Black slaves were able to adapt and became resourceful despite the cruel hardships they had to endure.

The 13th Amendment was intended to protect and guarantee that there would be no former vestiges of enslavement as practiced in the USA.

    "I'm not a supporter of any politician, I am a bit of a History buff. Weather you like Desantis or not is irrelevant, nobody in their right mind thinks slavery is a good thing. The statement that enslaved people developed skills that \"could be applied for their personal benefit\" is historically accurate. Industrialization had a lot to do with the freeing of slaves. The CEO's of the railroad industry and factories were aware that having former slaves as employees would benefit them greatly. The former slaves would work tirelessly for less pay and no bathroom breaks. There were other slaves who would learn the language and how to read and write (tho they tried to outlaw this). This definitely does NOT excuse the institution of slavery, especially in a so called free country. This is more of a credit to the slaves imo, they refused to have their will broken and they endured and overcame, tho they should never of had to.

    "How to do targeted Fact-based brainwashing:\nNever take accountability or admit your act! - in case of crises you start to reveal parallel facts of the problem.\nYou put all your effort into publicly analyzing them, and you open several new perspectives directing listeners or observers to different conclusions (in the beginning even opposite conclusions).\nNow, it's very important not to give fast and direct answers or directions - you stay in the observing position and give new leading facts or theories and \nfollow the conclusions of your information in observers.\nYour supporters and followers will always seek conclusions that support you - your enemies will seek and follow the path that is negative for you ...\nDon't deal with either of them - a dual selective brain must choose what to believe (truth) and both sides are pre-programmed. \nNow Neutral part of observers is what you must deal with, but you must understand that there is no need to give out information so that they \ncould make decisions based on 90or100% of actual facts - actually if 53% of the provided information supports the conclusion you need. It's enough...\nif you raise that % too high it actually may have the opposite effect.\nDuring the process, is very important to have opposite-side participation if you want to have an even higher level of control over the process you must do it for yourself.\nThe neutral part will get suspicious if the information is too good to be true - give out enough positions where observers can identify with the problem.\nAdmit some mistakes and faults in your process, but only so much that the observer can understand that you make mistakes at their level but of course much less than they do. \nGive it time, don't react, no direct answers, etc - those morons will do everything by themself.\nStep on the stage as an everyday saint - yes you have flaws same as they do and you struggle every day the same as they do, but in the end, you have their best interest in your heart \nand you are just a bit better than they.\nPeople have forgiveness in their hearts, they need to be forgiven and they need to forgive.\nIf they can forgive you- they will feel like a good person and they love it. \nAnd the sense of power is addictive -Everything is in the hands of voters!\n\nIt's all for the greater good so...lies, crimes, and deceptions are irrelevant.",

Either the Russians are instructing Trump in blackmail or vice versa. Mutually assured destruction wasn't a bad to keep the peace. Russia and China are building nuclear weapons, stockpiling them, and, I recently read, selling them so smaller countries have big weapons and blackmail their neighbors.

    "Part One:  The insertion of specific back-end clauses in the USMCA, replacing NAFTA, under the former Trump administration has sparked apprehension regarding potential vulnerabilities for the future of the USA, potentially aligning with Russia's interests. There are speculations about whether this could precipitate a scenario reminiscent of the collapse of the former USSR. If Russia were to successfully annex Ukraine while simultaneously destabilizing the USA and shaping other countries' perceptions of America, the ramifications could be significant. Former President Trump's criticisms of NATO and his apparent willingness to align with Russian actions against NATO countries only heighten these concerns. Additionally, there are concerns about the possibility of using perceived mental decline as a decoy to divert attention from broader trends and developments since 2015.\n\n(Peering into Putin's thoughts amidst the turmoil of the USSR's downfall...)\nZooming out and examining the geopolitical landscape, parallels can be drawn to the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s. The Reagan administration's assertive approach in the 1980s, notably in the arms race, strategically compelled Russia to allocate hard currency away from mitigating consumer shortages within the USSR, redirecting those resources towards military spending. This redirection of funds weakened the Soviet economy and played a significant role in its eventual demise.\n\nThe collapse of the USSR was hastened by events such as the coal miners' strikes, which resulted in power outages disrupting people's sleep and causing alarm clocks to flash, failing to wake them up for work. This implosion highlighted the vulnerability of centralized economies. These strikes not only exacerbated the issue of empty store shelves but also intensified economic turmoil, ultimately playing a pivotal role in destabilizing the Soviet regime. Putin and other strategic thinkers, cognizant of these historical lessons, may perceive such vulnerabilities as exploitable, especially in conflicts like the annexation of Ukraine.\n\nThus, the memory of the USSR's collapse serves as a cautionary tale for both Russia and its adversaries. Understanding the fragility of economic and infrastructural systems underscores the potential impact of strategic actions on a nation's stability and military capabilities.\n\nGiven the timing and recurrent patterns dating back to 2015, coupled with recent developments, it's evident that Trump's actions align with a concerning agenda. Just as Trump becomes aware of Ukraine's depleted ammunition supply and the impending vote in the MAGA House to bolster Ukraine's defense, a critical situation unfolds. By February 20th, 2024, Russia gained the ability to strike Ukraine from a significant distance, while Ukraine found itself inadequately armed to retaliate effectively, resulting in its retreat within its own borders. Trump intervenes decisively, instructing M. Johnson to block any funding bill for Ukraine, even going so far as to backtrack on previously agreed-upon border budget allocations. This sequence of events strongly suggests a calculated strategy aimed at advancing Russian interests, portraying MAGA as a compromised entity serving Kremlin objectives rather than prioritizing American interests or freedom.\n\nSenator Schumer finds himself entangled in a frustrating predicament, attempting to negotiate with the erratic and cult-like figurehead, Speaker Johnson. These zealous devotees are prepared to sacrifice national interests, individual freedoms, and more in service to their allegiance to Trump who is willing to give them the power to ultimately force the dark age religious cult beliefs they have onto the masses. They represent an extremist faction of Christianity, advocating for the imposition of their beliefs at the expense of all others, reminiscent of authoritarian regimes like ISIS. Their vision entails a return to archaic principles, where dissenters face severe consequences, including capital punishment.\n\nThe situation is compounded by Trump's susceptibility to manipulation by Putin, who leverages religion to consolidate power and expand his influence. Putin's history of exploiting religious institutions for political gain, exemplified by his interactions with the Russian Orthodox Church and the Pope in Jan 2000 when he came to power, underscores a pattern of deceptive tactics aimed at subjugating populations while consolidating authority. This manipulation of religion serves as a mechanism for authoritarian leaders to exert control over their constituents, enabling them to turn a blind eye to atrocities committed by dictators in exchange for unwavering loyalty.\n\nThe genuine risk and imminent threat may have been quietly brewing for years, biding its time for the opportune moment to surface. Despite the looming threat of significant legal repercussions that could lead to his downfall, his consistently irrational behavior demands examination. Yet, with the introduction of a disruptive element, his actions suddenly seem less illogical. Could it be that all along, his objective was to metaphorically dismantle the United States, understanding that Russia's overarching strategy aimed to diminish the nation's global influence, consequently devaluing not only the country but also his own holdings within it? It's plausible that he was privy to this scheme, banking on the assurance of power and wealth in Russia as compensation for his efforts. Throughout history, strategic deceptions have unfolded, trapping individuals in the maneuvers of more cunning adversaries.\n\nPart Two Below:",

Instead of prioritizing merit, which is generally the key factor in ensuring the military's (what should be primary) objective of lethality, his suggestion, to my understanding, is that military leadership should primarily be focused on putting certain numbers of folks from various races into officer roles. That, to me, is the biggest threat to losing talent and is a wholly illogical approach. Requiring certain racial makeups down to the percentages which match up with census data will almost irrefutably guarantee that you do not have the most potent force you can. We don't do that for the olympic teams, for the NBA, for the MLB, for the NFL, for any other enterprise whose outcomes are based on ability.

And, given that these 'holds' aren't even formally recognized by the Senate Rules, and given the actual harm caused by extended 'holds' by a single Senator, or 'held hostage' for the purpose of effecting POLICY change, (when the matter being oh 'hold' has ZERO to do with POLICY) One would think the Senate Leader would and SHOULD put an end to the hold, and bring the matter to the floor.\n---the right of senators to place \u201cholds\u201d on legislative measures and executive and judicial nominations is not formally recognized in the standing rules of the Senate. Holds\u2014or the ability of a single senator to block the majority leader from calling up legislative measures and nominations\u2014arise in the Senate because of the chamber\u2019s reliance on unanimous consent agreements and debatable motions to proceed to schedule business and organize debate on the Senate floor. Lacking a previous question motion, a simple majority is powerless under Senate rules (except under special conditions) to determine whether and when to proceed to consider a measure or matter on the Senate floor. By placing a hold on a measure, a senator is registering his or her intention to object when the majority leader seeks unanimous consent. Although nothing in Senate rules binds either the majority or minority leader to honor his colleagues\u2019 holds, such objections typically delay action because leaders are loathe to upset colleagues whose cooperation will be needed in the future. Leaders can ignore holds, but to proceed in face of opposition they would customarily then have to pass a motion to proceed, which is subject to a filibuster.",

Mr. Trump if you are reelected will you promise to do a better job responding to a new virus? You were warned on Dec. 19th of a deathly virus escaping a lab in China while you were golfing and your only response was it was a democrat hoax and you did not do anything until Jan 13th 2020 when you put in a no fly order but 400,000 people already entered our cities from China from Dec. 19th to Jan 13th to infect the whole country.\r\n\r\n2. Mr. Trump when you ran for president in 2016 you said you would bring in the best to solve problems but you ended up firing over 50 of them. Will you, if reelected, make a better effort to bring in the best?\r\n\r\n3. Mr. Trump when Michael Cohen was released from prison he said he was releasing a tell all book so you ordered the DOJ to rescind the release and remanded him back to prison to stop the book release. If you are reelected president will you promise not to weaponize the DOJ to go after anyone you perceive to be a political enemy?\r\n\r\n4. Mr. president in 2020 you lost the election by 7 million votes and claimed the election was a fraud and stolen from you. Your team went to court with 59 cases but failed to show any fraud that would reverse the results of the election. If you lose in 2024 and you cannot find fraud will you again scream the election was stolen or will you respect the peoples vote and assist in a peaceful transition?\r\n\r\n5. Mr. Trump when you left the White House in Jan 2021 you took many boxes of top secret documents, and when the FBI asked you for their return you only gave them a portion of them and lied about having more. If reelected president will you follow the procedures for handling sensitive top secret documents?\r\n\r\n6. Mr. Trump, when Obama left office he warned you that Michael Flynn was a double agent working for Russia and Turkey, but you ignored that and hired Michael Flynn to head the NSA just to fire him two weeks later. If reelected will you promise to take the advice of prior presidents and not put double agents in charge of national security?\r\n\r\nDave Clark",

And to add insult to injury, I guess a bunch of you forgot how Kamala called Joe a racist to his face during a televised debate... and then she was all smiles and \"together we\" right into the the Vice Presidency.\n\nIt's totally empty.\n\nThe Dems haven't done anything to fight the rising fascism in this country OR at the very least ameliorate everyday workers struggling with skyrocketing income inequality and poverty. And this matches nicely with Biden's entire history in government, simply looking at \"investments\" and not _people._ It makes total sense given his willingness to reach across the aisle and work with former Klan. Itxs exactly Kamala's nature to just move up the chain at every opportunity not out of a sense of duty to anyone but herself as a liberal token, damned near in the same rhetorical vein as Pelosi wearing a Kente Cloth over George Floyd's murder as the most brain-damaged lip-service.\n\nAnd the kicker? Even a fair amount of Progressives could have overlooked ALL of that for another four years... until Biden kept behaving like nothing was happening while aiding a gen.ocide.\n\nSo as it is now, there's the maniac who \"DOESN'T CARE\" as he says, or the maniac who he and liberals have ALLOWED to roll back rights and terrorize minorities, growing into a full-on gangrenous infection of people who would rather our shared reality consist ONLY of themselves.\n\nWell?",
    "Such a great newscaster. It's a shame he distorts some of the facts. There are plenty of Democrats who poll better against Trump than Biden. Even \"Generic Democrat\" polls better against 45. It's because both Biden and Trump have extremely low favorability ratings. He's spot on with his financial opinions though, great job.",

    "When you describe (brilliantly) the strength of past presidents who made crucial decisions affecting not only the safety and security of the US but also of much of the rest of the world, it makes the image of that narcissistic orange imbecile seem absolutely appalling.

He\u2019s a laughing stock on the world stage, but can be likened to a toddler with a loaded gun in his hand, demanding what he wants and shooting anyone who gets in his way.

The logic of this presentation is sound, but it has done nothing to secure my vote.  It is the candidate that must convince me that he or she is the best person for the position and Biden has not done that.

To compare Joe Biden now, to Bill Clinton changing positions and signing a TAX legislation is just insane. I wish it weren't so.

Stupid corrupt trump also destroyed the agreement the US had with Iran to keep an eye on their nuclear development. Stupid corrupt trump also made a horrible deal with the Taliban instead of working with the Afghan government to remove US troops. Be smart, vote Democrat, vote Biden. Because the only way things can improve in the Middle East is through capable leaders, capable generals, and currently only the Democrats are willing to understand and make decisions to improve the situation.   Not voting is being stupid and a vote for trump who will make everything worse for Muslims in America and in the Middle East.",

He's very good at it, including embellishing, almost beyond recognition, any results for his decisions while president, which is just more performance.",

No one is asking to show him when he's talking classified stuff, you can still have them talking about trade or policy with the speaker of the house like how Trump did with Pelosi. But you'll never get that because what Stewart is saying is that Biden is as you see when you see him on film with meeting other leaders, a cheat sheet, stuttering, and amnesia (President Sisi of Mexico). Give me a break.",
    "This is the crap Bernie tried to pull at  the 2016 convention. Because he would not concede even though he had already lost the primary. This damaged and delayed the Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nI'm old enough to remember the  '68 riots but I never knew the details on the contested convention, wow! I believe  I thought the violence was about the Vietnam War. So that is how Nixon got elected, how did I not know this?\n\nThe so-called press is trying to make news, instead of reporting on it, especially this  fantasy scenario that is the talking point du jour, it's bizarre. It's not an option, so why keep talking about it as if it is? Makes no sense. They want chaos and trouble and are happy to manufacture it. Drunk with power.\n\nI always learn something listening to your show. What great stories about Roosevelt, knowing he was dying while WWII  was going on, what a heavy burden.",
    "New package of sanctions? ROFL! Yeah, we know how all that has worked out. How many more sanctions can you do? I thought they did it all when Russia invaded Ukraine. Literally, what more can you sanction that you didn't do already? It doesn't even affect them else there would be mass riots and protest over there. What a joke.",
    "Everyone is talking about Biden's age and how that is of concern.  I agree, it is a concern that he may pass away in office.  His mental acuity is not of concern, he is sharp as a tack.  I am concerned with Trump's mental state.  \n\nOf course Politico wants another candidate, because it would be more exciting from a story standpoint.  So far, this campaign has been really uneventful and will probably continue to be uneventful unless Trump is convicted of one of the many crimes for which he's been indicted, then it might get interesting.\n\n\nGavin Newsom has been going around the country doing whatever he can so the Democrats will win.  He stated months ago that he was not thinking about running  for president even in 2028.  Personally, I think he might try running for president eventually, but only after 2024.",

Bidens got diaper brains, rambling ray, clown on the world stage,  BIden, geriatric drooling, lethargy, stumbling and a vacant gaze, altered stance, often with lowered head, destroyed nerve cells in the brain. Biden make as much sense as checking to see how much gasoline you have with a match",

    "Well said, Lawrence. Your reporting is heartfelt. Age is a number; experience is golden and what is needed in the Oval Office. President Biden is more than qualified to serve a second term; he\u2019s a brilliant man, a grand negotiator, and a decent/kind human being. He cares about us. Thank you. \u2764",

    "Thank you so much for using your platform to bring this to the attention of the public. While Jon Stewart has the ability to be funny (or try to), he lacks an understanding of the basics of governing. I was very put off when he was brought back and don't feel like he's really what we need right, but that's fine,  I won't watch that.\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to explain the reality of the situation.",
    "Fan of your show for many years.  Over 3K previous comments, too many for me to read but, Lawrence,  when you spoke of the trans Atlantic flight, somehow I thought of another flight that was in real trouble that was saved by a veteran pilot who used all the knowledge and experience he possessed to save that flight from a very bad end.  When  it was all over it was that knowledge and experience that was praised, not his age.  I think the pilot's name was Sullenberger.  I hope this tiny thought can get noticed because IMHO it cuts to the issue favorably for President Biden because we all need a very experienced pilot right now.",
    "Lawrence, thank you again for one of the most important knowledge about the campaign fund information! I cannot understand why Americans won\u2019t give any credit for what I believe has been our best President has done for our country! I believe Biden is best for ALL Americans! I can\u2019t believe the disrespect from Americans that now flows through our country!",
    "MSDNC has NO ROOM to talk.  MSDNC and this show pushes these side show circus reports. I think this reporting will age badly come later this year when Joe Biden steps down.",
    "Excellent. Thank you, Mr O'Donnell, for helping us understand how conventions work and funding works.  You are so right, it's not about the performance, the speeches. It's the DECISIONS a president makes, the negotiations- often behind closed doors - that are important. Joe has surprised me in being a far better president than I ever would have expected. I don't always agree with him, but I trust him to do the very best for we the people.  I will not hesitate to vote for him again in 2024 - and for democracy ! \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99",
    "The young reporters only goal is to harass , humiliate, and ask only stupid questions to make our great President Biden look old! They should be so grateful to be President Biden even at his age with his experience, intelligence, compassion, work ethic, love for his country and its Americans that he would dedicate his years, energy, and life left to save our Democracy!",
    "Many candidates announce between 15 and 20 months before the election. I don't think it's necessary to declare your candidacy 4 years before the next election. Frankly, I suspect many voters would be sick of looking at you if you campaigned 4 years beforehand. Dean Phillips announced 12 months in advance of election day, but dirty tricks by the doomed Biden candidacy have been trying to make a joke of him. \n\nIt's ridiculous that we must have a VP that looks like a certain demographic, but isn\u2019t competent to do the job. A DEI VP is 1,000 times worse than a DEI President of Harvard. Further, polling suggests that a sizeable number of black voters have already switched to Trump anyway. Many more of what's left in Biden's base will follow in the coming months. I just saw a video where maybe 3 unrelated black women were separately asked about Biden. They laughed, rolled their eyes and mocked him. Don't ever expect blacks to be loyal to a white person. They'll turn on you in an instant. Watch your back.\n\nI just saw an article that said blacks will vote for Trump because they like sneakers. Some replied that is  RACIST. No, that's MARKETING. Some are thoughtful and won't be lured by gold sneakers, but some will be lured by gold sneakers. Sorry. It's a fact. There's a steady drip of black voters crossing over to Trump. The sneakers will draw a few percent more. Males of that age, regardless of race, aren't known for common sense\n\nI feel Kamala Harris should WILLINGLY RESIGN for the sake of the country to prevent Trump from winning. If it's done in a charitable way of her own choosing, I don't think Biden's remaining black voters will be so upset that won't vote for him. I think they should nominate Manchin to replace her as VP. If Biden showed support for Manchin, forgetting past conflicts, it should work. Look how Trump's former competitors team up with him in the end. Further, the Trump supporters I know all say they like Manchin. I believe they would crossover. Crossover Republican voters will counteract the black voters who switch to Trump, and might even exceed them.\n\nBiden would stay on the top of the ticket as the Presidential candidate so people won't be uoset, and Biden could keep most of his donations. Manchin would make most of those concerned with Biden's competency forget about it. Manchin might even attract many more donations as the Vice Presidential candidate. I believe Manchin would be confirmed by both houses of Congress considering the number of Traditional Republicans who dislike Trump. To me, this is the best way to go. \n\nDON'T EVER SUGGEST GAVIN NEWSOME AS A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE. He has ruined California. Most people,  including myself, can't stand him. We also can't stand Michelle Obama. They are WORSE options than Biden.",
    "A lot of people live in a fantasy world and never keep up with the News, or political facts. They talk through their hats.They give ignorant opinions about who should run for President, despite the fact that Biden has proven to be the best President we have had since FDR or LBJ. Besides, the runners are already decided.\nBIDEN GETS IT DONE! \nHE AIN'T NO SLOUCH LIKE T!!!!\nVOTE BLUE! VOTE BIDEN!!!",
    "Lawrence is worried enough about Biden's prospects to go into this long sermon against those calling for Biden's replacement.I guess Lawrence is a Harris supporter now? She's the party's only hope if Biden were to be removed from the equation. The die was cast along time ago. Y'alls miserable party of neo-segregationists will have to live with what comes up. So will my country.",
    "Bravo Lawrence! This piece of yours is so poignant, eloquent, and couldn't have been timed better. The work of governing versus the media \"shows\" is something for all of us grownups to have in mind and keep in perspective. Loved your reflections on Roosevelt, and thank you for the work of this piece.",
    "\"Recreational commentators\". Thank you Lawrence for the phrase. It is a very fitting phrase for the American press. Good thing we don't have to rely on them for anything anymore. Additionally, the Democratic elite spectators who like to pop up here and there to pontificate probably don't care enough to vote.\nBiden has been the most steady hand at the presidency for as long as I have been paying attention.",
    "It is refreshing to hear someone speak with conviction based on facts and not be a part of the click searching morons calling themselves news or worse, journalists. Thank you Lawrence!",
    "Listened and took in every word you said on this presentation. Lawrence, your time, like Biden's, mirrors deep experience and understanding of how affairs at a national level function. I truly appreciate what you bring to the current topic(s) & often either dovetails with my own opinion or instead brings me some aspect I'd never considered.",
    "I'd have a lot more faith in Gavin Newsom's support of Biden if he would also include Kamala Harris' name every time he says Biden's name. I really want Kamala to be next, but it's looking an awful lot like Newsom is the heir apparent. Another white man. Again. \ud83d\ude12",

We should throw out the whole thing!\" I'm like, \"Ok, what exactly are you proposing we do right now that doesn't result in trump and his Christian nationalist cronies taking over the country and permanently destroying it and any hope for change? What is the workable alternative to Biden that will not make everything horrible in this country much, much worse?\" and the simple fact is that they do not have anything approaching an actual, workable answer. This election is one of life's binary decisions. The choice between as the best option we are going to get or the absolutely worst thing possible, and an unsettling number of people don't seem to recognize that!",
    "how can we trust what you say if you never say anything bad about Biden ? Biden never did anything wrong ? its all lies ? I thought a reporter job id to report all the truth .....",

    "I sincerely hope that John Stewart watches this particular video. I saw the show where he said that their were no cameras to show us all how well Biden does in those oh so important circumstances. Maybe then he'd understand  why there is no video. I'm a huge fan of Stewart, always have been, but he was way off base on this particular issue. He's certainly not above admitting when he was wrong about something, and that's one of the many reasons I'm a fan.",

He asks smart Qs then let his guests have the spotlight  ... that's why his is the best of the best of political shows.",

And it s also a succession of exercices for a future run.",
    "Love seeing the walls closing in on Trump in this poetic way. Everything will ride on the election and he will watch it slip away poll by poll as we all relish in his much deserved impending doom.",
    "Agree with Lawrence. It is preposterous to dismiss what President Biden has accomplished just because no one has filmed it. No one should have filmed it and Jon Stewart should know better.  Democrats need better messaging but that is  a different issue than the quality of President Biden's work.",

He is insightful, thoughtful, and on point 100% of the time. He has never been interested in the Media elevtion horse race. He has correctly treated Trump as the liar he is. Other anchors can learn a lot from him.",
    "As a non American may I say this is been well put together and well spoken about. \nJoe Biden has been a great president and a calming influence in the world.\nTrump has been nothing but a braggards who lies through his his teeth.\nA supporter of Putin, and everything that makes America not so great.\nRepublicans have lost everything by climbing into bed with Trump.\nLike I said I am not an American. So as anyone heard Biden throwing tantrums everyday. Has he bragged about things he did not do. Has he made America great again.\nYes he has because Biden knows what made America great and it was not the same factors Trump talks about. It is doing the right thing.",
    "People asking for Biden to drop out are forgetting history: There have only been five (5) times in the nation's history when the party of the sitting president has dropped their president and gone with a different nominee.  The last time this was done was with Chester Arthur in 1884.  Only one of those five times worked: James Buchanan was elected in 1856. Buchanan is largely considered one of our worst presidents; his ineptitude primed the stage for the Civil War. It also led to such a split in the party that the Republican party came into existence and Lincoln was elected in 1860.  Changing horses doesn't work.  Biden might eventually lose in November, but Dems will definitely lose if they go with someone else.",

We don't give a crap how old or young the president is or if he has a stutter. We only care about the work he is doing & if he is getting the work done FOR US. I don't think I'm alone when I say we are bored sick of all these \"journalists\" who focus on political theater rather than just reporting facts & letting us think what we will about it. I like your show because I learn so much about lesser known American governmental history. You're a very smart man with really great writers. Thank you for being like the journalists I respected growing up and not like these \"journalists\" who have forgotten what their job actually IS over the last decade.",

    "Polls are no longer reliable because a large portion of the US voter has only cell phones and screen calls like crazy.\nI believe 80 millions people voted for Biden in 2020, and that was before Jan 6th. I believe this number will be surpassed for Biden\u2026 but of course swing states are the key. Still we need to hope that the 80 millions number will not make some people think it\u2019s a done deal and stay home on November. All the people who value democracy and our way of life need to vote, vote, vote to get rid fascism",
    "Trump has no idea how to be a good, let alone great president. He doesn\u2019t have the diplomacy, the character, the knowledge or any of the other characteristics necessary to be a good or great president. All Trump knows is brute force, at whatever cost to the citizenry or country, to enrich himself while eliminating democracy. Biden, even at 81, is the best man for the job at this time. Hands down!!",
    "MILLE MERCIS FROM QU\u00c9BEC, Lawrence, for this journalistic milestone expos\u00e9, a lesson among many, to aspiring journalists! This is why, if nothing else, every one should tune in to your daily show. MSNBC is lucky to have you?",
    "He\u2019s not popular. That\u2019s a fact. You can\u2019t force people to like Biden. I\u2019m voting for him for sure, but his hubris may land us with Trump and the end of democracy.",

There is no way he'd want to run for president this year, maybe in 2028.",

Both seem detestable.\nThe parties do this to voters every four years. It is disgusting.",
    "Words of wisdom. Not just about the current president, but meaningful for anyone aiming for a job that requires good governance. One aspect that's missing here is how power can corrupt the weak.

This country is going to elect a dictator because we can't acknowledge reality and admit that everything about Biden screams \"OLD.\"  Walk down stairs?  Looks old.  Answering questions?  Sounds old.  My memory is fine.  Mixes up Mexico and Egypt.  \n\nLook everyone.  The age issue isn't going anywhere.  Saying Trump is old too doesn't move the needle.  Biden always looks to be a couple of winks away from sleep.  Trump is always foaming at the mouth with misguided, or even staged, rage.  Because he's always yelling, he comes across as decades younger than Biden.  \n\nThe biggest blessing that could ever be bestowed upon the Dems is a Biden health issue that is JUST serious enough to encourage him not to run again.  It allows him to save face and step down, and the party can then move on.  We are literally walking towards a dictatorship because people are in denial about how serious the Biden age issue is.  \n\nUnfortunately, this is the new, more literal, Pride and Prejudice.",
    "The only scenario in which Joe Biden is not the nominee would be his disability, to the point of the 25th Amendment being needed, or his passing.

    "Dear Lawrence, I record your show every night because I believe it's the best. Thank you for the enlightening discussion on campaign funds, specifically the difference between those used for a Gov vs a Pres. I also appreciate your efforts in educating reporters on their absurd &  baseless questions &  insinuations about Pres Joe withdrawing from the race, which were highlighted at the start of your broadcast. It's a shame that low-caliber reporters like Doocey and his ilk try to create sensationalism and 'gotcha' moments at the expense of the Pres under the twirling blades of the roaring helicopter. Very SNL. The way they bark questions at the Commander & Chief is ever so disrespectful and rude.  Ignorance is a contagious disease that is perpetuated by Diaper Doncon and the Fake Fox Propaganda Cabal, as they continue to pollute the airwaves. I am grateful for your insight and dedication to truth-telling. Thank you once again!",

Unless you think that the UN, UNESCO, ICJ, Amnesty International, etc, plus all those American doctors who have volunteered their time to go over and help in Gaza for a few weeks.   Those doctors  have been in many war scenes and say this is the worst they have seen, at least one or 2 children a day come in with limbs that have been blown off with bombs W|E supplied.

    "The media needs to keep reminding the public of all of Biden's accomplishments in support of the average American citizen and of what he is continuing to work on for the American people. At the same time, the media needs to remind the public of Trump's failings; how he handled the pandemic when he was in office, how he worked to lower the taxes on the mega rich and the huge corporations while in office instead of lowering the taxes on the common people, how he still insists the 2020 election was stolen when there is no evidence of that, how he continues to spew untruths and immature insults at anyone whose ideas do not align with his, etc.  The media needs to continue to fact-check the things Trump says and call him out on them immediately. A straight and immediate response to all things that are not true is needed so that there is little room for misinterpretation.",
    "The thesis of this broadcast is exactly what made Trump 45.  He had a made-for-television presidency and was great at it:  being on TV, not governing.  His term was essentially a Howard Stern show,  saying outrageous things so people would tune in and not miss the next bit of scandal.  He lead us down the garden path and then turned the hose on us.  Continuing to support Trump is like continuing to play three-card monte with a boardwalk hustler, even though you know the game is fixed.  Never underestimate the stupidity of the American electorate.  That's what the republican party knows best.",

But this is such a powerful, convincing and heart-felt opinion piece I think I've been turned on the subject (and I really didn't think I could be turned on this).

So people generally think problems are being hidden.",

Even before watching this segment, I was committed to re-eleecting President Biden (tremendous wisdom comes with age and so does 50 years of experience as a public servent). Age-izem, in President Biden's case, is ridiculous and short sighted. What we find on the OTHER side of the \"aisle\" (Nominee selection, Senate and House) should terrify you as it does me.

    "Actually the \"smooth\" way.. that came along with the idea of an \"on time\" television show..THAT REAL FAILURE happened 20 years ago. Rallying his own chances to take control of what was a U.S. military and foreign policy gone wildly awry, he stepped to the stage to give what's always (or used to be) the nominee's best opportunity to RESET THE START BUTTON. And he did so brilliantly. The best speech ever heard.. or should clearly have been one of them. Forget this testimony. Ask that Joe Scarborough who was covering it LIVE.. AND PLENTY LATE at that.. on that hit show Scarborough Country. Anybody got a cigarette. With my heart coming out my chest and maybe on the verge of real emotion, i began to notice that John Kerry's finest political moment was being sabotaged by.. by John Kerry himself. The applause was trending better and better.. hitting the notes with extreme sense and clarity of purpose.. BUT NOT WAITING FOR THE APPRECIATION he was surely registering to hit its poignant pitch. Instead, he apparently had gotten the high sign that he was in danger of GOING OVER the allotted \"top of the hour\" and the Dems handlers who had strategized that an incumbent WAR PRESIDENT could only be beaten will well-timed local news coverage. Forget emotion and pride and nostalgia for DOING THE RIGHT THING.. and forget an unexpected crescendo of just that thing.. from what was this UNPATRIOTIC PATRIOT of some LOST WAR. More and then more noticeable, Mr. Kerry sped up his delivery to totally counteract the obvious beauty and impact of his words. By the time THE END came into view, he had already qualified for new nickname.. Machine Gun Kerry. But the Dems were STILL MEDIA LATE and OPTIMUM MESSAGING SHORT. The greatest heist.. ever committed.. by self-attached brains. Grand larcency of oneself by oneself. Who you going to call to right this kind of wrong? Ghostbusters.. Ohio? Just to say.. what's right doesn't always have to be.. blowing red lights and kicking up mud. Especially only to get your girlfriend home in time for dear old Dad's deadline. This is so true and painfully recalled detail by this Dem. FAILURE BY CIRCUMSTANCE comes in all time and manner. It knows no other name.. no brand of smokes of the blokes left out. JUST ASK JOE SCARBOROUGH if he didn't remember it.. this exact way. Thanks for your service.",

    "Just a thought from Canada regarding the American Dems. From my meager understanding of  US politics, although Ms. Harris is quite presentable camera-wise and has a very engaging personality and speaks well,  from what I remember of her prior official office placements, She was an organizational and political disaster with apparently zero ability to organize even a one car parade, and yet managed to fail herself into the Vise Presidency.\n\nMaybe the solution to Biden's age thing, is to put someone in the position of VP who would calm the concerns of Mr. Biden suddenly dropping dead. That situation is not only very possible, but I think predominant in the minds of American voters. Within these very real existing conditions, could the Dems maybe put, without demeaning Mr. Biden's abilities, or Ms. Harris' abilities, a 'younger' Biden as VP in the next presidential running?... just in case?",

    "the journalists have all become rag sheet writers. It's like they have more interest in soap operas. What a shame. They forget they are the 4th branch of government. They act like a bunch of carnival barkers. no real journalism or facts. just shouting and noise. thank God for the Meidas Touch network.",
    "President Joe Biden might be older and a little slower but he is not senile and he will still continue to do what is best for our country and save our democracy do not underestimate this man by any means he's gotten more done than any president I can remember and he truly cares you can see it and hear it in his voice when he speaks he might not be loud and jump up and down like the other idiots but he has class God bless Joe Biden vote Biden for our democracy Our Lives depend on it\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99",

    "The best primary challenger to Biden is already his VP. She don't have to campaign or be brought up to speed. She is more than capable of doing the job if necessary. Won't don't more Dems see this? The 'Biden is too old' smells a lot like the 2024 version of Bernie bros.",
    "Lawrence at his best! I've listened twice and will again.  I only wish that this kind of rhetorical power could--just once--be turned from pennyante politics to what Biden has called the \"only existential threat\" we face: Changed Climate.",
    "You\u2019re right. They don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on YouTube channels like this and was feeling good about Biden\u2019s prospects of reelection. But y\u2019all\u2026 I got back on TikTok and Democratic Gen Z\u2019ers are NOT voting for Biden as long as he does nothing to end the genocide in Gaza. And they are convinced he has done absolutely nothing for their progressive causes. They are either only voting in local elections and holding their presidential vote back in protest or they are voting third party.",
    "Biden is a disgrace almost as much as Trump. Biden is going to lose and Harris is a nonstarter. Stop trying to scare people into voting for Biden. People would be better served fingering out how to get rid of Trump after he is elected. Neither of these two old white men are fit to serve.",
    "A very good historical analysis that I appreciate. Nevertheless, it's going to come down to what he starts with: genocide in Gaza. Several Dems I know will never vote for Biden now.",
    "It feels strange to disagree with Mr. O'Donnell on something, but even he knows that if Biden were to suddenly seize up and drop from the election, The People would flood Newsom with funds in prep for his ascent to the Presidency.",
    "I\u2019m not sure how Gavin Newsom got mentioned but I believe in his last major interview he was campaigning on behalf of Joe Biden and has no desire to run for president. So I don\u2019t know why a poll on Newsom for president was even conducted? I don\u2019t believe that there are any democratic challengers. It appears that the dems consensus is to see Joe Biden finish what he started. Just saying.",
    "Pete Buttigieg would be a better candidate. Biden's age is a major issue and he's not addressing it. That's why he's behind Trump - the most flawed candidate that has ever ran.",
    "I'm sorry but anyone who looks at Biden and thinks he isn't up to the job, just watch that clip at 0:50 again. Asked who he would prefer to face \"Oh, I don't care\" says it all, he knows he is better on his worst day than either of them on their best.",
    "Biden's responsibility, as president, is to manage teams of people to develop and implement policies and to protect the interests of America and of the free world. He's doing that all quite well, albeit with some of the other party trying to kneecap him for the dumbest of reasons - at the expense of our nation.",
    "Thank you Lawrence for your words. I am so sick of main stream media and their ridiculous attacks on Mr Biden. He is the best this country has to offer hands down. I and my entire family will be voting for you in November Mr Biden. Here is to your health and long life! VOTE BLUE IN 2024!! Lets get our House and Senate Blue too so we can codify womens health choice and voting rights, and create comprehensive immigration law. We can do it, GOP cannot. They are a know nothing, do nothing fascist party.",
    "Thank You Lawrence. This was a great argument and a clear explanation as to what really happened at the DNC in Chicago 1968. Now l understand why age of the Pres. really doesn't matter.",
    "I have no faith in polls either.   It all comes down to whether voters vote with their heads and have a good knowledge of the issues and who it is that is looking ourt for them on the MAJORITY of the issues; or single issue voters (why?  does an abortion foe not care about the environment, medicare for their aging parents and relatives,, their social security, unions, or any other issues that touch their lives? etc.) or politically illiterate voters (who have no knowledge of the Constitution,  the succession order, or even the courts;) or voters who vote on emotions like, \"well, I don't like that person (even if that person is the most qualified, works like crazy for the greater good,, etc.) so I won't vote for her/him;\" or someone really not paying attention (especially recently) with the so close votes in elections saying, \"well she's gonna win anyway cause she's far ahead in the polls, so I don't need to vote;\" or, \"well she's pretty and young (even though her policies are antithetical to my interests) so I'll vote for her.\"",

It's all blowhard opposition candidate running around making fantastical speeches and posturing all day long to their base while the governing party is fighting hard to keep Canada from falling into the morass of Far Right Ideology designed to divide and conquer. We need a strong and democratic US and a strong and stable Canada to partner up and support each other through times good and bad. Biden is your best candidate of the moment.",

This is the kind of life people who live under under dictators, must suffer, even if they only question for clarification of a governmental decisions.\nBE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE VOTING FOR. \nLISTEN TO BOTH SIDES OF THE MATTER, WITHIN THE OPEN MIND AND SEE WHAT MAKES MORE SENSE TO YOU.\nTHE WORLD IS WATCHING AND CROSSING THEIR FINGERS YOU WILL MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE USA AND DEMOCRACY.\nPERSONALLY, I WILL VOTE FOR DEMOCRACY EVERY TIME . THE ALTERNATIVE IS TOO HORRIBLE TO IMMAGINE.",
    "So eloquently spoken, Lawrence.  So well done to tie your point together from every angle.  I loved this.  You are so well spoken that it was easy to follow you.  Other speakers, commentators stumble over words and lose the point and get confusing, but not you dear sir.  Well done.",
    "This was an extremely informative & valuable, educational piece! \n\nI am a Gavin Newsom fan. He sounds like a really smart guy with a lot of good answers. In a perfect world, I\u2019d like to give him a shot & replace Biden with him but now I understand why that\u2019s an impossibility.\n\nI\u2019m not against Biden as much as I\u2019m worried about the perception of his  age becoming a deciding factor in the next election.\n\nI just hope people keep their wits about them & remember the devil he\u2019s running against.",
    "Joe Biden could wake up sleepy and groggy in his pajamas and is still a better President or Presidential candidate than anyone in the Republican Party. If I asked stupid questions as the media ask at work meetings I am sure I would be demoted, fired, or fazed out.",
    "It\u2019s true we only see the results of the presidency an the results that we see is bombs, death, more propaganda, using DOJ to take out political opponents. Lol yeah no one likes the results we see.",
    "I hope the pro-Biden faction can deliver a win in November. I didn't want Biden to be the nominee in 2024 (or 2020), but that is the reality of the situation. I will vote for anybody over Trump, so Biden can count on my vote.",
    "How do the American people not see what President Biden has done for your country? He took a country Trump destroyed and made it strong and envied again. Americans should feel so blessed and lucky to have such a person running your country,. Age is a number....and that is all it is. Shame on those who don't  see Biden for who he really is",
    "Bravo Lawrence, the press simply misses the boat\u2026..they honestly do miss the important things and focus on what they think will get clicks and sell papers\u2026..the news media must do better\u2026..they are responsible for djt in the presidency the first time around\u2026.don\u2019t make the same mistake twice\u2026..vote responsibly people",

    "Thank you. Thank you. Americans need to know what the job of the president is really like. Experience counts. Breadth of knowledge counts. Decisions must be made using both experience and knowledge. Presidents may make the speeches alone, but they don't do the job alone, who is chosen for the cabinet and other advisors is crucial. Biden has chosen really good ones. I'm supporting Biden all the way and I fear that all the media attention on his age is actually a Republican talking point because they don't have any others.",
    "Not an american and been screaming put someone younger with all the talents you have in that party...not because I don't like Biden but because I'm afraid your voters only see age and not the wisdom behind those years.  I will stop now after seeing that beautifully done piece of journalism..i get it now. Please find a way for everyone to see this.",
    "Bottom line he's not going to win against trump again. It's just unrealistic to think this. The only way is to work against the clock to replace him. Stop this foolishness.",
    "Somebody has to be standing by in case Biden pulls a Ginsberg during the next  year. I may be quoting Peter Zeihan, 'Biden will win in a landslide, if he lives.'  Fingers crossed.",
    "Very sensible words. Thank you Lawrence. I like Jon Stewert, but he crossed the line when he asked if anybody filmed Biden at work. Pretty sure he knew it when he said. He's not stupid. Glad you have the experience to tell us exactly why these meetings are not made public. Thank you for all you do.",
    "I worked for Gene McCarthy. I was too young to vote. I was so bitter about the 68 convention. My boyfriend came home beaten to a pulp. I was 16. My parents wouldn\u2019t let me go to Chicago.",
    "I always say that the success of a candidate is based on 2 things: 50% of what they bring to the table (education, experience, intelligence, background) and 50% of what the \u201cculture\u201d is at that time. Now, a candidate only has control of the 50% that they bring to the table. That\u2019s all they can control. The other 50% is completely out of their control: maybe the country is calling for a change/younger president, or a president who doesn\u2019t come from a traditional white European Christian perspective, or the country is in a Me-Too time where we elevate the power of women, or maybe we need a war president. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that that is the reality. A candidate can be the BEST candidate in terms of intelligence and experience and not meet the \u201cneeds\u201d of the outside culture at that time. THAT is the reality here. \n\nJoe is smart and good and competent and is getting important things done slowly, consistently and behind closed doors. But the reality is that he appears older and occasionally confused and that makes people worried and feeling vulnerable. This is not his fault. We will all hopefully get to this spot. But the reality is that we live in a visual society, and the majority of people are only interested in sound bites or view bites. And many are having cognitive issues bad cause of illnesses over the last few years. And no, we are not saying we want trump. God no! But we have ONE chance to stop the threat of losing our democracy. One chance. I\u2019m half Biden\u2019s age and I\u2019m tired at the end of the workweek. I can\u2019t imagine being 85 years old and holding the weight of the USA in his hands.\n\nI hear what you\u2019re saying, but it worries many of us.",
    "The whole world has been in awe with the energy and strength that Jimmy Carter displayed AFTER being President and he made it well into his 90s yet it's \"impossible\" for an 80 year old who has been president to be president again?! Give me a break! Biden is NOT too old. He is experienced , a little slower but still mentally sharp. he doesn't need to run any marathons or throw shotput. Next the naysayers would say that someone in a wheelchair like say, Steven Hawking couldn't be president. HAVE SOME RESPECT!",
    "President Biden has arthritis which makes him walk carefully but he still rides his bike and his brain is sharp! Trump\u2019s brain is addled and he couldn\u2019t put a leg  over a bike!",
    "Decisions ARE the President\u2019s responsibility. Biden has the experience and created a highly competent team around him to provide \u2018in the trenches\u2019 knowledge, experience & opinions for him to make the best decisions. \n\n45 was a know-nothing, egotistical president who surrounded himself with sycophants without experience or backbone who offered advice not what is the best for the country & the world, but only what is selfishly best for themselves & that president. And that is all he wanted to hear.  That is the priceless lesson we learned from 45 and his cohorts. Never again.",
    "This drumming up Biden for president feels oddly familiar to 2016 - electability matters and Bidens age is destroying his electability. \n\nI will hold my nose and vote for the adult but arguing that nobody else polls better than Biden is short sided.  Polls will change and money will come.",
    "\"Reporters\"? I want to see credentials.\nPresident Biden shouldn't have been the candidate this time. Really. Let Grandpa retire.  You can't tell me there's no better candidate, in ALL the USA.  Of course it's too late now but this started THREE years ago!\n\"There is no one polling as well as JB.\"  Because he's been forced down our throats from the beginning!  Just like Hillary was!\nI've got an idea.  How about spending the four year election cycle searching for the BEST candidate?\nI am worried about his health. I am also worried about a desperate Trump in the weeks before the election.  How far will he go to get elected?  Trump's LIFE depends on this election.  Would you be surprised if a Trump loving sycophant offered to have JB assassinated?  Would you be surprised if Trump accepted that offer?  \nTrump can't win a general election. We all know what he is now.  His only hope is to utterly destroy the Democratic candidate.",

    "Thank you Lawrence. The US is the only culture that prizes youth above Elders. We don't see the true Elder in Biden, his experience, his wisdom, his compassion.

    "Lawrence, well spoken Sir !  And to your point that this is the final quarter of the campaign, I can't believe these pollsters are taking a true representation of the voting public.  Almost every election since 2020 has shown the Democrats dominating - THOSE are the real \"polls\".  There is absolutely no way that tRump gets as much of the vote as Biden, in the real world.  It is a pollster's fantasy that tRump is in the lead ANYWHERE, he is even loosing some cultists !",

    "I would rather have a quiet, calm experienced older gentleman, who has good advisers around him, and makes decisions based on the good of the country, then a loud, crude, failed/fraudulent buissinesman that surrounds himself with yes men and greedy goons, with no understanding of how governments work, who  makes decisions based on what's in it for him, and is only running to try and avoid the consequences of his crimes and to try and turn us into an authoritarian country with him in charge.",
    "I so would love to like this 1000 times. In the old / ancient days there were the wiseman - the elders. That is what I see in Joe. A man who has gathered a lot of wisdom in his political carrier and uses it ... wisely and for the nation ... not for himself.",
    "Lawrence IMO This talk demonstrates that if the Democrats are not careful, THEY can accidentally bring Trump to the presidency. I am a registered Republican and will never vote Republican while election deniers are on the ballot, including Trump. I will hope my Democratic friends and relatives see and HEAR this program. Thank you.",
    "Thank God people like Lawrence O'Donnell are speaking out and calling out the idiocy of certain \"reporters\" and \"executives\". It's unfortunate that it took Jon Stewart to ask if anyone filmed President Biden being competent as the press keep making him looking like an Old Grandpa. Unfortunately, the News in the US is seen mostly as \"Entertainment\" with a focus on ratings, which is why the executives idiotically gave Trump stupid amounts of air time as opposed to fact checking him real time. After all the executives were after a performance and it seems these executives still have not learnt that News is *Not Entertainment* .",
    "I'll say it, the real reason the media and talking heads hate Biden is cause he's boring and doesn't give them red meat to publish books about them the way Trump does. Biden isn't profitable for yellow journalists, Trump is. That's why they act like all of Trump's crimes can be brushed aside because Biden being old is the bigger sin in their eyes",
    "Full disclosure. I used to vote Democrat as did my hard-working parents. But *this is no longer my father's Democrat party! They've abandoned the middle class and push race and identity politics - and Socialiam - which is fundamentally un-American! Cancel culture, woke,  trans athletes making a mockery of Title 9 in girls/women's sports - Americans are sick of it! That's why Trump is leading in virtually every poll in virtually every swing state!*",
    "It's not that I have undying respect for Mr. Biden, as good as he has been doing, but this gaggle of supposed \"journalists\" sound more like they represent a supermarket tabloid than real political newspapers.  Man, has the tRump cult mob dragged these reporters down to the gutter level of trashy questions, or what ?  They are a total waste of Biden's time !",

I for one think that in spite of his huge accomplishments Biden should not be running in 2024, but the announcement should have been made one year ago. As things stand now Democrats must unite to promote his bid for a second term by highlighting his achievements and by contrasting his integrity, his moral values and his intellect against the GOP\u00b4s presumptive candidate.

Gavin Newsome is an extraordinary opportunist & phony, a total corporate flunky (like Bill Clinton), who did NOTHING to preserve precious water resources in CA, allowing Nestle & others to take massive amounts of water out of state and pay NOTHING for it.  Also continued to allow fracking, which uses and destroys MASSIVE amounts of water, taking it out of the hydrologic cycle forever.",

His ego is so massive that it's all about him whereas with Biden, it's about the American people!!! Actually making things better for them and the country!! Not for himself like drumpf! Vote blue to keep the circus out of the White House!!!",

    "There is a time and place for political theatre: speeches, ribbon cuttings etc. but governance  and decision-making doesn't, and shouldn't take place in front of cameras, as Lawrence correctly explains. We have a generation of journalists, and people in general, who live their lives on camera, with selfies and social media the order of the day, and they expect everything to fit into that milieu. That's fine in your social life, maybe, but not in governance and journalists should not expect that. People like Ezra Klein, whose work I admire, should know better, but then again, he's of the social media generation, too.  Biden has 81 years of experience and wisdom. Trump has learned very little in his 78 years except how to be bigger and bigger a**hole. It is obvious which of the two is the better choice.",
    "Lawrence, DO YOU CARE?  If you do, read the books, Eternal Treblinka, Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust, by Charles Patterson, and Will Tuttles  book. The World Peace Diet.

If YOU CARE, see Forks Over Knives, What The Health, Cowspiracy, Dominion,Earthlings, PIGNORANT, and MSNBC  hire a medical consultant, Dr. Michael Greger, to do programs on how to be a healthy society .",
    "Thank you for stating the obvious! I am so sick of mainstream media pandering for viewers. They're playing both sides against the middle, and it's total bs. I hear nothing about Biden's accomplishments from the mainstream media because they're busy focusing on the fact that he's old. I just saw a video clip of a 94 year old woman, and everyone in the comment section was talking about how sharp she was, how with it, and how capable at 94 to be living on her own, so coherent and vibrant. I fail to understand why people are having such a difficult time with Joe Biden being 3 1/2 years older than Donald Trump as if that somehow makes him feeble and incompetent by comparison. The feeble and incompetent is the one who completely wants to destroy our democracy to save him from the legal woes that are the consequence of his own criminal actions. I would rather have an old grandpa in the White House than a criminal who's only 3 1/2 years younger than the old grandpa. The media needs to grow up and quit promoting chaos. I understand that chaos gets viewers, but it's disingenuous, un-american, and detrimental to the entire nation and world.",
    "The craziest part by these people is how they ignore VP Harris and thereby ignore the most loyal and dependable portion of their base. It\u2019s astounding how obtuse these people are.

    "PS:  I DID ask for someone besides Joe Biden to be Dem's presidential candidate 5-6 years ago, but Biden/Harris had already been anointed by Democratic hierarchy by the time primaries/caucuses came along. I'll end up voting for Biden/Harris again, because what choice do we have. Just wanted to explain why I may express frustration at finding myself without a real choice again.",

What you're reporting is SO obvious and yet SO overlooked on purpose; for the viral moments the press and society has the tolerance for because the education we need from the results of the work done, is too long to report and an eternity to accomplish and yet Biden's done so time after time.  Who cares about sneakers when everyone of our lives are affected by the positive work our President has masterfully enacted with little public and private support and yet here we are out performing every other nation including our own before Covid!?  If Biden had the support of the party and the public like the predecessor, there would be no debate about polls or the outcome.  Let's Go Biden 2024!!",

Trump will still be at the bottom because score will go down though he got 10 out of 100 this time. He'll get three out of 100. Joe Biden, on the other hand, will be in the top five presidents of all time in the history of the United States of America. He has done more good for America than any recent President has done. Vote for Joe Biden on November 5th",
    "Daar Mr O'Donnell, as a European following American news media, while really respecting the knowledgeable approach and no-nonsense language you are using - I really have to wonder: Why don't you address the obvious problem presenting itself with your own repeated question of \"What about the money\"? How can it be that politics and even the possibility to run for *public* office are primarily decided by money? To me this seems the intrinsic problem of the US political system that leads to the unenviable situation your national elections are in right now.",
    "I'm 72 YO and I'm ridin' with Biden.  It makes me sick that so many progressives and democrats are giving Biden such a hard time at the same time republicans are trying to move mountains to attack him with false allegations and smear his name.  I don't like what's happening with U.S. policy towards Israel either but let's face it, Israeli's and Arabs have been fighting since practically the dawn of civilization with no end in sight, but here at home our democracy is literally at stake and a lot of people seem to have forgotten that if we lose in Nov. the middle east conflict will be a forgotten memory, and they will still be fighting and killing one another, and we will be too oppressed to notice or even care.",
    "we're living in the era where what is happening in the political arena is perceived as just another 'reality TV' show.

    "Mr. Lawrence: You are absolutely amazing and to the point. More or less no one is saying what President Biden is doing and has done for America. I firmly believe that out of all the candidates, President Biden has the chance to lead the country. He knows a lot and is a decent man. He has had a lot of experience in his own life. He was not a financially spoiled child. I also strongly believe that many journalists are ageist. They also don't present a real analysis of the actual, delivered work, quality, knowledge, intellect and presentation of America on the international stage. This is unbelievable and also detrimental to the USA.",

    "I'm going to play Devil's Advocate for a second, not b/c I believe what I'm writing but b/c Mr. O'Donnell's arguments have so many holes in them, I've had sieves that retained water better.  First of all, in a world with so many cameras, where so much of what appears on a screen before us is fake, the absolute last thing we, as a voting populace needs to see, is our president doing something fake.  The presidency is one place where we do NOT need and should NEVER want to see the performance, and definitely the governing should be filmed.  If we vote for this person, we need to see what we are actually getting- not a show.  It doesn't matter if it's the president or someone else in that office.  If, behind closed doors, someone is taking a side different from what s/he campaigned on, we deserve to know why and to watch it happening so that all is revealed and we can make an informed decision.  That's our right as voters.  This is a prime example of why fairytales start with, \"If I am elected...\"   We should not now, nor should we ever be electing show people.  That's just blatantly dumb..  \nSecondly, the vast majority of the populace didn't not know that Roosevelt was in a wheelchair.  This is because his campaign strategists knew he would never be elected if the voters knew he were.  The fact that he was wheelchair bound became known to the general populace after he died.  We know that J.B. is losing his memory and fumbles and flubs a lot.  We can see this for ourselves.  This is already out among the voting populace.  I\"d say, \"Nice try,\" but that'd be a lie.  \nThirdly, F.D.R. and J.B. are two different people, two different presidencies in two different times.  Shall we discuss other presidents who were mentally not there, especially during their second terms?  Let's look at all the things that Regan did, how he wasn't able to go anywhere without George and Nancy and an entire coterie of people telling him who the leaders of other nations were because he couldn't remember them.  It looks to me like we're facing that again.  That was humiliating on the international stage for us then, and now you want us to be intentionally humiliating to ourselves again?  \nI could easily continue but frankly, you're arguments have more holes in them than an ant farm.  Don't bother to feed us the crap.",

Glasses for President Biden needs to be a movement, I honestly believe it with both aid him with the press and endear him to the American people, especially boomers.",
    "Lawrence, this is unfair reporting from you of what Ezra Klein of the NYT had actually said on his podcast. After relating about how he feels that 46 is a good president he DOES go on to say that he thinks that Biden is not up to campaigning for the presidency. He points to the low numbers of interviews he has done as compared to past presidents - even though daily press briefings take place - and to the president's inability to show the constituency that he is able to become the president again despite the wins that the Democrats have been chalking-up all these years.\r\n\r\nIt is unbelievable that the loudest voices of the press at 46's announcement of sanctions on Russia/Putin deflected to things on which they want to report and not to ask questions in pursuit of that which the NEWS-MAKER had just said. WHOSE job is it to understand and report and to whom should we be asking pertinent questions (as opposed to impertinent ones)? How did the questioning contribute to the understanding of what Biden had just informed us? Don't we want to know what these sanctions are? what the methods of implementation are? and what the hoped-for effect might be? These overloud, as you so pithily described: horse-race reporters prevented my representatives of the press-corps from asking the necessary, pertinent questions or these qs being heard to be responded to. Hearing from the press-corps the unsaid insult to our president and to their readers that that which the president has just said is unimportant and its being loud enough to drown out others and their pertinent questions makes me un-confident of speaking to the press in this way, at all. Giving the job of answering questions to a press secretary is simply more efficient and less time-consuming. The president and team must be able to do their job.\r\n\r\nFinding a problem to a solution is backwards thinking, bordering on invention and blocking information. Anyone can do this, \"Why are your shoes tied in this way?\" \"Are you boycotting Arizona by flying to California?\" or any such thoughts or questions changing the narrative which the news-maker is presenting is a shameful distraction.",
    "I hope some investigative reporters are really digging into the story, perhaps multifaceted, of the forces behind the drive to replace Biden in the 2024 Election. The \"polls\" and the reports and the voices, who they are and what is their motivation. I'm not saying that it's a \"conspiracy,\" but I'll bet there's a story there.",

    "Excellent arguments. Pity it may go over the head of many voters (10 minutes from the start of the video)\n\nAnd now I've this through to the end - this video is more than excellent. It is technically THE best argument against a Trump like president. Trump knows nothing other than the on-camera performance, the clever sound-bytes, the grifting comments. All of which attract and convince voters to sympathise with him. But when it comes to actually doing the job, any job,  - what has he done? Surrounded himself with incompetent actors pretending to do real jobs. Trump's acting has inevitably ended in failure, bankruptcy, lies and criminal behavior.\n\nThe fact that polls show even a modicum of support for Trump just shows how many American voters see only the theatrical performance rather than the serious work of getting results. I fear for American voters. So many mindless cults have ended in mindless tragedy. Let's hope that Trump's campaign ends like almost all of his other enterprises - bankrupt and begging for pennies.",

In the past, it was commonplace for presidential candidates to be chosen just a few months from the election at their conventions.\n\nMSNBC: you\u2019re as pathetic as Fox. Liars and cowards.",
    "Lawrence, that brought me to tears - well stated.  \u2764  The life experience cannot be underrated.  If you've not seen history or studied long-term results of past elections, it's so easy to be a staunch idealist with blindness to all else.  Wanting a young, poster-handsome, progressive, podium hammering, unicorn policy maker is understandable, but not at all the best choice.  For a world stage POTUS, you NEED someone who has first hand experience with that world, as well as our own history, economy, and society.  Someone who will listen and adjust and, yes, compromise for the greatest good.",
    "Look, Lawrence, I sure do not want to see Trump in the White House. He belongs in the Big House. But face facts. Yeah, being the POTUS is about making decisions. Biden is getting lost in the middle of his own sentences now, just like my mom, and we don't even let her drive the car anymore. You guys have really messed up. What should have happened is that, having rescued the world from a second Trump term, Biden should have gone on to set Harris up with some decent responsibilities, given her the chance to prove herself, positioned her for a run in 2024, and, as an octogenarian who'd done his bit, gracefully stepped aside as a successful one-termer. Too late now. So millions who might have voted will stay home because they think it's just a toss-up between two daffy old men, and Trump just might ride into a practical dictatorship on the back of Biden's stubbornness, just like you lost sanity on the SCOTUS on the back of Ginsberg's.

    "Govenor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan/Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia. Unbeatable  ticket. People need to learn who Whitmer is, and once they do, she will be unstoppable. She has done a fantastic job in Michigan on the economy and healthcare, and she is smart, charismatic, has a great sense of humor, and is very likeable. She has no real vulnerabilities, unlike Newsom whose record in California would be disastrous. \n\nWarnock is also very charismatic. He would bring the Black vote, particularly Black men.  And while I don't generally believe that where a candidate is from matters, in this case, both candidates are beloved by Democrats, and I believe would carry both Michigan and Georgia.",

And the dems already cancelled a few primaries and when they were found guilty of cheating Bernie in 2016 and said they can do what they because they are a private organization. So it\u2019s not too late you\u2019re just trying to convince your gullible audience that it\u2019s too late. More corporate media propaganda.

    "to your point about all important decisions being done in private/ away from cameras; that doesn't mean that he doesn't have a duty as a President and a candidate to reassure us. These fears are out there now, legit or not, and the Biden campaign should spend at least some of their money and time showing us that he isn't as frail as we think. Unfortunately, just like truth and fact didn't really matter in the 2016 election, they might not matter here, and people are gonna vote with their feelings, so make them feel like he is worth voting for. praising his accomplishments is part of that, but so is making them feel like he is capable. for the next nine months, the presidency will involve a lot of performance, for Biden to get reelected.",
    "I .would respectfully disagree. Biden could of course say now, that after careful consideration he indeed feels the burden of age and office combined and would ask someone else to take up the mantle and continue and this could very well be Gavin Newsom, who, imho, is one of the biggest political talents the Democrats have. It is a sure sign for a fool to never change an opinion, and Biden ain't no fool.\nI guess Biden has to aknowledge that his age and Harris popularity, one big, one small, are the heaviest Millstones at the Democrat's necks. That is not fair, but then, what is?",

    "Truly, an excellent show And the reality is, it is absolutely too late to switch horses. One item that I think is unfairly treated somewhat is the polling discussion. \n\nAs you point out, you can\u2019t put too much stock in presidential polls this far out, but this has to be especially true for candidates who are even running like Kamala  Harris and Gavin Newsom.  The right has done a very good job painting California as a political disaster That people are fleeing in droves.  Neither Harris, former senator from California who worked her way up through the prosecutorial ladder in California all the way to AG, nor Newton. The current governor of California, have really had an opportunity to respond in the way that presidential candidate would.  \n\nWhat California has many problems. It is also thriving in many many ways. Our entire country is facing many challenges that are more extreme in California because of the massive population. The bottom line is if people are leaving California as fast as the Wright would have you believe California would be in a recession.  Housing prices would be plummeting and businesses closing left and right.  I live in Nevada, and through business encounter a lot of people from California. I also travel there frequently.  People from California have a fair amount of complaints regardless of their party affiliation. That\u2019s the number one complaint I hear is that it so expensive.   Well some people are leaving the golden state, has continued to attract new residence from all over United States. Americans voting with their wallets her want to be in in California- The bottom line is I agree with your analysis as to why it is too late to switch horses, but if we were in some imaginary world where Biden voluntarily stepped aside, and the entire Democratic Party coalesced around one candidate, without any damage being done. \n\n\nI have confidence if  either Harris or Newsom were to be the nominee independent motors would vote for them in numbers just as high as Joe Biden. But they just really haven\u2019t got the press coverage.",

    "Not a single high profile Democrat even suggested they might contest the nomination of Biden. So this is ridiculous. \nBiden/Harris is the most productive team of the last 50 years. \nThe 2028 primary should be a real barnburner with so many smart Dems out there.",

But, like housework, whether done well or not, we can see the RESULTS.\n\nBiden's results have been unequalled since those of t President Johnson in the mid-1960s.\n\nBy every Presidential  metric, Biden has greatly exceeded expectations and prognostications.\nNone of his decisions have been \"age- dependent\" or based on memory deficiencies.\n\nWhat matters in a President is the ability to put the good of the country ahead of personal considerations.\nBiden has done that consistently and succeeded beyond even the most optimistic projections.\n\nThe issue is about the ability to weigh all the factors and make the best decision possible. Biden continues to do that. He has earned his candidacy by being one of the most productive Presidents in American history.\n\nAll Elections are a gamble. Anything could happen to a President of any age at any time as the Presidency of JFK taught us.\nPresident Biden has shown himself mentally competent to do his job. \n\nHis opponent has shown himself to be mentally, emotionally, and psychologically incompetent to do the work of the Presidency.\n\nThe choice is clear: Competence or Incompetence. I choose Competence every time.",

    "If given the choice of Biden vs. Trump, I will be forced to vote for Biden.  Am I happy about this?  Absolutely not.  Where are the primaries?  Where is the choice?  I witness signs of dementia in both Trump and Biden.  Biden is head and shoulders above Trump in knowledge and intelligence, but that does not seem to be a characteristic important to half of American voters.  America's elections are more like beauty pageants than serious political discourse, and worsens by the year.  Stupidity is no longer a source of shame, but a point of pride among America's bottom third of the population.  The DNC leadership is jeopardizing the return of Donald J Trump in a rematch that never should have happened.  Trump's cult will never be swayed, combined with the votes of thoughtful conservatives, the balance is terrifyingly close. Unless all voters are invigorated, especially minorities, and get out to vote, seriously handicapped by Republican chicanery, the return of Trump will result in a civil war.  Once the US falls, Putin will take at least eastern Europe and China will make a play for Taiwan while simutaneously making the Yuan as the global standard of currency.  We are at a crucial crux in history where our real problems are the coming disaster of global climatic change, the rise of Putin's reign of terror, and something that the news agencies are not giving the degree of urgency on China's export ban on rare earth elements.  This will cripple America's high tech industry for ten years as we gear up our own capabilities.  How this National Security issue has gone on for so long is frightening.  If Taiwan falls, 90% of IC chip production that runs every aspect of modern technology, including our defense systems, will become unaccessible.  China's dominance in high tech is part of a long term plan to neutralize a very volitile US in world matters, once our capacities are nullified, then world finance will fall under Beijing's firm grip.  Meanwhile, we are a feckless superpower, with a House of Representatives controlled by trailer trash candidates arguing about pressing issues like which party gets credit for what, Hunter's laptop and transgendered bathrooms.",

If Joe has lost a step, he is still performing at at least 90%, my guess is 97%. If he died tomorrow, Harris, backed by their excellent Administration, would do a very creditable job. If Biden has a terrible stroke, his Administration would do a better job than any possible chump Administration, if only because it would avoid the chaos, treason, and revenge of chump 2.0.

We are saying that a MILLION people younger than 81 could do the same job. Yes, a million. So why could we not find even 1. Simple, because 'we' were not asked.

    "I find it a little curious that up to now I\u2019ve not heard promotional discussions which could alleviate some concerns that I observe to appear as a make or break decision on your great countries future. There\u2019s a global altering fork in the road that your founding  \n fathers , with their knowledge and historical experience of living without the freedom to dispute accusation constructed the greatest doctrine that any country could provide its citizens. Individual protection of freedom, religion and equality. It has been a stunning revelation to witness just how much of your population is unable to appreciate the underlying intentions of your constitution. If only they could experience how life is for those who live without the basic rights of a true yet very fragile democracy. \nAnyway my intended point is that the president is not a single person, rather it is a corporation consisting of a multitude of dedicated people who honor their oath and are dedicated to the furtherance of civil freedom and wellbeing.   The actual person with title of president is merely the frontman for the conglomerate of like minded people who value humanity. Simply put, just because President Biden stubbles a word now and then ( who doesn\u2019t) does not suggest a complete disfunction  or breakdown of the US government. Even if he were to pass away the government would continue without disruption. (JFK). Biden\u2019s policies are not crafted without the input of highly qualified, intelligent, experts (yes, of course there are political biases, how can there not be). \nThe Democratic Party is not reliant on Biden  but the future of democracy surely is. \nIt\u2019s somewhat ironic that the people who once ruled the very country which your founding fathers defected from are undoubtedly praying for your democracy to prevail. \nGood luck. \n6\u00a9\ufe0f",

So it seems clear to me that throwing the Democrats into chaos and getting rid of Joe Biden as the nominee is the single most important aim of both Putin and Trump. \n\nSo are all these journalists witting or unwitting tools of Putin?

    "When Jon Stewart brought up the fact that there was no video proof of Biden showing his compentency during negotiations/meetings, I questioned Biden's capabilities too. Thanks, Lawrence, for telling us the reasons behind no cameras during these important discussions and for giving us examples of past presidents. Lawrence worked in government. \"The governing will not be televised.\" Vote blue!",
    "So great!! You summed it up perfectly! Biden has done a great job! Bravo Joe!\nI hope the democratic convention doesn\u2019t try to get rid the great President we already have for the a B candidate. It would be a great mistake!!!",
    "The media don't realise that if Trump gets power they will all be out of work because he will shut down all media outlets except maybe Fox which will become a government led outlet",
    "\u2764 thank you..Mr Lawrence..what a piece. We will never know how many voters are taken aback for a couple of minutes to ponder the truth behind all the razzmatazz of BS tv presently.\nWhat ever the criteria, experience will never ever be supercede by the theaterics. \ud83d\udcaf",
    "Harris is why it's worrisome. She's been like wallpaper.  In a sane scenario it would be Raskin Perry.... Biden has actually showed up to work, refreshing...\nNow if Biden had Equal Media coverage for his accomplishments.......",
    "Thank you, Lawrence.\n\nI really think those saying Biden should drop out are useful idiots for someone.  It's so propaganda-ey.  Joe Biden is genuinely the best president of my lifetime (73 years), and I've always paid attention (and remember 1968 Chicago). Just as important, Biden's team is incredible.  Biden has so much experience, and he also knows well the right people to have on his team.  So I don't give a you-know-what about his age.  Experience, intelligence, compassion, and the WISDOM he has are what matters to me.\n\nVote Blue!! \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a",
    "This was excellent. This level of insight is so rare in today's reporting. Thank you for combating all the disinformation and click-bait noise out there. Biden is the best choice in so many ways. Good luck, America. And vote blue!",
    "While the head is important the legs and arms are what get the job done. Biden is getting the job done by using real people who he respects to get the job done. Trump wants to be the head the arms and the legs. Age is a number. Attitude is what gets the job done.",
    "Scott is a great man and to Scott I need to tell him President Biden treated me like s** he never liked me he never respected me he never showed me any kindness and most of all never showed any love as a friend Donald Trump show me kindness respect and love I never treated me bad he only loved me I vote Donald Trump 3:02 3:02 3:02 3:02 3:02 3:02 3:02 3:02 3:02 3:02",
    "Biden is clearly lucid and on the ball. He makes a few slips but nothing critical. Probably America needs to start getting younger people to run but right now Biden is by far the best option.",

    "A 4-yr long campaign?! Observers from other western-style democracies must be horrified. Election campaigns from Australia to Austria, from Croatia to Canada, from New Zealand to Norway, all last about two months. Four years?? Ugh, \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
    "I am sure President Biden will be at the Democratic convention party leader!! He is Winning by big numbers in the primaries so far ! Sooner or later the two candidates will drop out ! Vote blue and for President Biden",
    "One person who generally wants to do good by humanity is the guy who knows his days on this planet are numbered. \nBiden has A HEALTHY CONSCIENCE!! \nThat is something that the vast majority of Conservatives just don\u2019t seem to understand.  They just don\u2019t get it!",
    "The polls are useless liars:\nHow many people can not afford\nthe Cost of being in a poll or\nto sign a petition; $5 and up to \n$20 just to sign.",
    "Lawrence, love you, good and honorable man. Newsom is campaigning for Joe. It\u2019s a thing of beauty to see loyalty to public service, and giving honor words to others. Good stuff to remember. Listen to Gavin\u2019s words and not the stink from the gutter.",
    "I salute you, Lawrence O'Donnell. Thank you for calling out these \"horse race reporters.\" I don't have a journalism degree but you can be sure if I had the privilege of standing 10 feet away from the President of the United States -- let alone President Biden whose leadership has been exemplary -- I could come up with a more respectful and relevant question than asking him to pick between Donald and Poor Nikki.",
    "What people see in our POTUS as signs of aging are probably the effects of that horrific car accident he had decades ago to include traumatic brain injury. I wish an MD would explain to  \"We the People\" what that looks like.",
    "There is no one else that could take President Biden's place. For some reason some people just can't seem to grasp what President Biden has accomplished. We should all be thankful that he was there when he was there.",
    "But, it would be a good time to start looking at Newsom and other potential successors for Biden to run in 2028, and start raising their profiles. For most of us, we'd never heard of Barack Obama until he gave a speech at the 2004 DNC, and 4 years later he became President. Start bringing the best and brightest (and most electable) to the forefront NOW, since, as Lawrence (and everyone) knows, it's a four-year-long race.",
    "13:08 \u2014 Lawrence, You might as well say it out loud: however \"altuistic\" & \"Democratic Party- loving\" who's suggested Biden drops out, especially without mentioning MVP, want the Democrats to LOSE. Make no mistake. They do know ALL you've said, or they're mouthpieces for people who do. Follow the money, for sure.",
    "What about the Putin-inspired poll saying Joe Biden is 4 points ahead of Trump already! Reverse psych--ops, no less. Technique works on Russians and this year they have set about testing Americans. I say, you are right to have little trust in polls. After all, as Joe Biden himself says, polls don'ytvote--voters do! \ud83d\ude42",
    "Thank you for this, Lawrence! Absolutely brilliant and true! One can only hope that the agitators with ants in their pants - who feel the need to throw public tantrums - are listening to wisdom and find a little humility\u2026",
    "I love how you point out the job is about decision making and the results of those decisions show up afterwards. Look at the economic markers - the numbers! The data! \n\nHe is old school - and that\u2019s a good thing in our current situation. His experience is absolutely needed in our times. Cooler heads have to prevail.",
    "Why don't they try asking Trump how he is going to get corporations to lower the price on everything since some think that  prices will go down immediately when he shows up?",
    "A valuable lesson Lawrence.  Let's hope the 'students' were alert and focused.  And in their free time, ask them to study how often the press & pollsters get it wrong.  Thanks for the history lesson.",
    "They don\u2019t care about how badly they treat him either!! They are blind as well as rude!!!! I thought he was WONDERFUL and REALLY COOL. Go Joe!! Omg. Are you Americans MAD? I wish we were governed as as well as Biden, here in England.",
    "Lawrence.......I woke up at two in the morning and tuned in to your Wednesday night program regarding Joe Biden and the office of and task of the presidency........I listened to every word you said,....the current state of the campaign, the facts, the media frenzy, and,....the historical perspective that you so masterfully crafted..........In the convoluted, chaotic and perpetually maddening world of modern politics,......you have reaffirmed my faith in American democracy, and the strength of the ability of our current Commander  in Chief to continue to lead our nation by providing us with sane governance........THANK YOU...!!!!!!",
    "Stewart literally Both-Sided the argument then got mad people saw through it and did a 'I'm only asking questions' to wave the criticism off.\nHe and no other pundit of that tabloid class understand how the Presidency works. Neither do I, but I'm far more willing to admit that and see what effects the Presidency has by the nation around me. By that metric Joseph Biden has been the greatest president of my time. Better than Clinton and better than Obama as a Democrat and as President in general. He has my vote and my support without need for embellishment or nose pinching.",
    "Thanks Lawrence you nailed it.  Those who think that Biden can be replaced aren't thinking more than one move ahead on the chessboard.  If you look at Allan Lichtman's keys to the white house.  Ditching Biden removes two keys (incumbency and nomination challenge) and likely hands it to Donald Trump.  Biden COULD still lose, but is less likely than any other candidate (as you point out).  Looking forward to the Biden victory lap and hopefully Biden will nominate Clarence Thomas' replacement.",
    "Right on. Jon Stewart deserves some attention for his insight, or, has deservred attention... but his blind spots are miles wide, and his biggest blind spot is thinking he doesn't have a blind spot. \"Do you have any footage of that?\" If i didn't know better sometimes I'd think he was a 14 yo on Tic Tok.",
    "This same situation will apply to the Republicans, if they should have to replace The King in Orange after Nikki Haley drops out. If you think a contested Democratic Convention would be bad, try to imagine how nasty a contested Republican Convention would be! \n\nThe Criminal of Mar-a-Lago (assuming his drop-out would be caused by legal troubles rather than one too many hamburders) would demand that his delegates refuse to support anyone else no matter what, out of spite. He would have drained the RNC's coffers with his legal bills, and Nikki Haley probably would not have a whole lot of cash on hand if she tried to return.\n\nThen there's the whole clown car of kooks who would be scrambling to win MAGAme of Thrones and seize leadership of the Republican base.\n\nIt would certainly make for great television!",
    "The sad thing is that the 50+ years of experience and expertise of President Biden in government service and the fact that he never had corruption are often underestimated, but MAGAS keeps conspiring a corruption issue against him to destroy his reputation. The latest was that the ex-FBI informant charged with lying about President Biden and his son had Russian intelligence contacts, prosecutors say! That's how MAGAS makes conspiracy theories and smear campaigns against President Biden and Democrats in their desperate attempt to save and protect their MAGA leader.

    "This was one of the best half hours of television I've seen in many years and one of the most important editorials of the decade.\n\r\nIt was intelligent. \r\nIt was informative. \r\nIt was important \n\nTo the social media manager on the MSNBC account, please send my thanks to Mr. O'Donnell and to all the staff involved and to all the executives at MSNBC and parent companies for producing it.",
    "Disingenuous of Lawrence to leave out Josef Stalin from the roster of WW2 head-of-state parties, even given the mental \u201coptics\u201d of who deliberated on what.  Fact is, the Red Russian Army did the most \u201cliberating\u201d of death camps in that era & sacrificed the most personnel to do so.  Not that Stalin was a realistic paragon of statesmanship himself.  FAR from that, as it turned out.  But the recognition could have saved half as many lives as he ultimately took\u2014but for \u201cFear itself\u201d on the part of a rabidly anti-Communist empire (so it claimed, but it\u2019s fine for rich people, who, incidentally, were themselves nowhere near comprising an oligarchy stateside, at the time).\n\nMuch Thanks to Lawrence O\u2019Donnell just the same, for reminding observers to historical events what many had probably forgotten & many more probably never even learned vis-\u00e1-vis political conventions.\n\nPaving a singular pathway to Sanity must be a lonely & difficult/challenging undertaking in the midst of such needless & tragically frivolous madness!!

All the elements of your argument were relevant, sound, and undisputable. I loved every minute of the 27 you took to roll it all out for us. As a trained historian, I especially loved your use of history. Bravo, the best reasons to move forward with Biden and stop the whinning and bed-wetting.

    "The issue of performance, that the president should look and perform like a Hollywood movie star, and that he should be entertaining is why America is in such trouble. Americans need to seperate the job of governing from that of popularity. We elect the leader of our country and thus the leader of the free world. We are not electing the prom queen.",
    "It would be the best turn of events to see Gavin become the president (after Joe retires). Just because Kimberly Gilfoyle can then say \"I left a future president, went crazy, then watched my ex husband become president.\" This is after watching the \"Trump Kingdom\" collapse. Talk about choosing the wrong side... \n\nI'll vote Gavin over \"Slippery Don J\", any day. I feel like with his complexion and personality, that he is imbibing and needs to spend some time in rehab. His complexion, mannerisms, and person has changed drastically in the past 5 years... Why  is he always sweating? I hope he's just overworked and in good health.

    "I recognize you people.  You're as blind to reality as Trump's supporters are.  You -- including you personally, Lawrence -- are the same ones who were assuring each other and anyone who would listen that Hillary Clinton would defeat Trump in 2016.  Joe Biden's numbers are abysmal.  He destroyed his chances by placidly failing and outright betraying the majority of us in order to protect and appease his wealthy donors, and he's recently made matters worse by materially supporting Netanyahu's indiscriminate murder of innocents in Gaza.  I pray that something, anything keeps Trump from making it to November; incarceration, the 14th Amendment, primary losses, a flight into self-imposed exile abroad, or choking to death on his own lies.  Any of those would suit me just fine.  That way when Biden loses, it at least won't be to Trump.",
    "Lets be clear...the \"thought leaders\" of the Left that are pushing this narrative that Biden should step back...these are the journos and grifters that would not be badly impacted by another Trump term.

They sold themselves to the Israelis Lobbyist.  No one thinks that all this money the Political traitors send to Israel is the right thing to do.  It is wrong.  Biden is taking the people money and supporting genocide and protection for criminal Israel.  Israel has never gotten along anywhere they go.  Israelis think American is dumb and stupid.  Netanyahu act as if Biden is scared to refuse whatever request he demand.  What a fool.  The lobby will destroy America if we fail to eliminate those who sold out.

I bring that up because Biden was supposedly deposed after that incident. If you think back on how government officials just described what happened as a result of that attack, its horrifying. With that in mind, also keep in mind that Biden was essentially a civilian that may have seen some pretty bad stuff depending on his Senate committee assignments, but probably nothing close to the level of the presidency. I said all of that to just say it would be tough of any civilian to recall certain things that happen years ago when images of that event still fresh in your mind.

Just ask yourself why Churchill wasn't in the room when the 2 came to an agreement about it, even though the UK had gone to war over Polands rights. All I'm saying is that yes a president can do a good job at old age but sometimes you can also underestimate your opponent.",

I would also love to see him also put so much sanctions and pressure on Russia!!!!!!!!",

At best they want attention and publicity, at their worst they are entirely ignorant of what the job of the President and Vice President and cabinet entails.

How he looks and how he performs while looking Presidential is \ud83d\ude02 utterly and entirely the most bigoted thing a Klansman can say about a Black or Jewish candidate running for president. And the most sexist and misogynistic thing a Fascist Dictator loving Republican could say about a woman running for president.  Let's not discuss qualifications  people let's focus on whether they look the part.\ud83d\ude05 Only comedians could say something so stupid and people think their must be a grain of truth.

A man who was willing to do the work of a  president even when it cost him his own life. We need a man like him now and Joe Biden is of the same mold. He has done well so far and there is no reason to think he will not continue to do so. Thank you Lawrence for the civics lesson.",

    "There are two main reasons for Biden poor ratings, neither of which he can control.   1 Is his age 46 % of the electorate said they were concerned about it.   The rest of their concerns about him are in single digits.  and 2.   87 % of Republicans have told pollsters  that they do not believe he was  legitimately elected president         What is the probability that these election deniers will ever give him a favorable rating  ? --    ZERO      His low rating is what is driving  the Dump Biden Call.     I think he should just ignore them and continue delivering for the American people which is what  he was elected to do.",

You have quieted any doubt I had regarding the election in spite of my concerns about Israel and  the plight of the Palestinian people.",
    "President Biden is a humble man and has honor. \nHe has a good head on his shoulders because he is always thinking about We the People, and he is not a boastful man at all. \nI know that President Biden is not a young man, but I don't care about his age. \nPresident Biden could be 100 years old, and I still would vote for him. Because he is a good, kind-hearted man and is not boastful at all like the evil Lawless One Trump.  \nMay the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY keep President Biden super healthy in mind, body, and speech, always in Jesus' name. \nAmen! Amen! Amen!",
    "That was a great argument, but if Joe appears weak and senile to average Americans during speeches or what have you, other countries are getting that message to, and that negativity affects us all. How about the reports that certain countries refused to take the presidents phone calls? Obvious disrespect. They sure would not have done that to Bush, or Trump, or even Obama. America has been the world bully for so long we can not afford to appear weak or senile, we got enemies hiding under every rock waiting for an opportunity, or what appears to be one.",
    "I think President Biden gave a great answer...\"I don't care\".\nPresident Biden shouldn't care about ... Trump and Nicky Haley. \nPresident Biden must and has to focus on managing the government. Because this is so much to have to handle. \nMay the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY JEHOVAH FATHER, his son the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY JESUS, and the LORD HOLY SPIRIT WHO IS ONE GOD ALONE grant President Biden another 4 more years for president in Jesus name.  Amen! Amen! Amen! \nMay the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY destroy all evil wicked plans that Trump and all of his evil wicked servants the Republicans may come up with to try to hurt President Biden and against his son Hunter Biden Jesus' and the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY protect and defend President Biden and his son Hunter Biden in Jesus name.

    "I remember when it was easy to find George W. Bush voters who would tell you that they wouldn't vote for Gore because he sounded preachy and they didn't want to have to listen to him for four years.  I never heard a reporter respond with this question: \"Have you heard of this great new invention?  It's called a remote control.  If you don't want to listen to Gore, you can press one button and listen to Emeril, reruns of Golden Girls or a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  If you don't like to listen to Gore, you'll like this device.  Now that we've alleviated that problem that you have with Gore, why else won't you vote for him?\"\n\nI mean, if you don't like classical music, you don't stream classical music.  If you don't like to watch basketball in April, you watch baseball in April.  If you don't like steak, you eat fish.  No one forces anyone to listen to a president.  The president is not required by the Constitution to make a single speech, not even the State of the Union Address.  Between Jefferson and Wilson, presidents delivered a report on the state of the union in writing.  It was delivered to Congress, as the Constitution requires, not directly to the American people.  No problem.  Country survived and prospered.\n\nMr. O'Donnell correctly points out that, to most Americans, the job of the presidency is to perform an entertaining song and dance for the American people, not to carry out the serious work mentioned in the Constitution.  Big turning point?  Clinton playing the saxophone on Arsenio Hall's show.  Preceded by the media's fixation on Jackie Kennedy's beauty, fashion, poise, intelligence and charm, JFK's ability to crack a joke at a press conference and Reagan's impression of the grandfatherly Marcus Welby.  At the time, each of those was considered a one-off, not expected to be repeated by future presidents.\n\nNone of that had anything to do with whether JFK or Clinton or his successors were/are good presidents.  On this, Mr. O'Donnell has hit the nail on the head, and it is a very significant point, particularly in an election in which Trump has a role, because his whole message is for people to vote on the basis of their emotions.",

A real president diesnt seek camera made ego boosts,or fake scenarios as photo ops,while soewing lies,and nonsense.

    "FIRST THREE YEARS OF JOE BIDEN\u2019S TERM.  ISSUES TO CONTEMPLATE. \n\nJoe\u2019s economic policies made Americans poorer (2021-2023). 2024 is shaping up as a better year, due to immense deficit federal spending.\n\nCanceled important Presidential Executive Orders to slow down the \u201cillegal immigration\u201d tidal wave. Thus telling the world: \u201cwide open border\u201d, now in effect. Three years to correct this situation... sadly no effective action. It was recently reported that Joe is taking a look at Presidential executive orders. Must be a Presidential election coming soon!\n\nThe crossing of the border by 8-10 million \u201cillegal migrants\u201d, criminals, terrorists, gotaways, etc. This will affect all 50 states, their state safety net, housing, flooding of hospitals and educational systems, criminal systems, and employment opportunities. America does not support \"illegal migration\". America does support \"legal\" immigration.\n\nForced states, cities, and communities to financially  support relief efforts for 8-10 million \u201cillegal migrants\u201d, thus depriving American citizens of these funds.  No word from the President on why this is in America's \"best interest\". Americans do not support \u201cILLEGAL migration\u201d. America does support \u201cLEGAL\u201d immigration.\n\nThe United States has just undergone its MOST SUBSTANTIAL ONE-YEAR POPULATION INCREASE IN HISTORY, with growth exceeding 3.8 million people in 2023, primarily attributed to \u201cillegal migration\u201d, according to a recent report by John Burns Research and Consulting. Another first for Joe!\n\nHindered states from trying to stop \u201cillegal migrants\u201d from crossing the border. Joe went all the way to the Supreme Court to allow US border agents the right to cut barbed wire to let \"illegals\" enter this country.\n\nLittle to no  border security. The Mexican Cartel assists and controls the entrance of migrants, criminals, and terrorists into America. Joe made the Mexican Cartel an annual  multi-billion dollar organization.\n\nLittle to no  border security allowed huge amounts of the narcotic drug fentanyl to cross the border. Yearly, 75,000 deaths of young Americans (15-44) occur. Many others are damaged for life, overwhelming medical and social service programs. Their life expectancy is 47.5 years. Expect 300,000 families to bury their children during Joe's four years. Expect the Mexican Cartel to rake in billions of $ dollars.\n\nAmerica has a \u201clegal\u201d immigration system. Joe prefers the \u201cillegal\u201d way.  Make your way to the border, put one step over the border, claim asylum, and you are \u201chome free\u201d. A court date,  5-7 years in the future determines whether your reasons for asylum are valid.\n\nBottom Line: American citizens are taking second place to the \u201cIllegal migrants\u201d rights and welfare benefits. Americans are paying the taxes for these benefits for those who \"illegally\" entered this country.\n\nDerailing America\u2019s oil, coal, and natural gas infrastructure. Prices are now higher for Americans. Green is better,  no matter what the cost is for the next 25 years?\nTrashed the American built and multi-billion dollar LNG (liquefied natural gas) export business. \n\nWorsening dementia. A \u201csevere\u201d handicap for the position, President of the United States. Some call it the \u201ctoughest\u201d job in the world.\n\nOccasionally sleeping during meetings, losing track of dead people, ignoring reporters, working a 8-5 job with weekends off.\n\nTaking America deeper in debt, now at $34.15 trillion dollars ($34,150,000,000,000). Interest paid on the national debt is now marching higher: as the old debt matures at low interest rates, it must be replaced by debt at now much higher interest rates. Thus less money to fund America\u2019s social and defense programs.\n\nBy not invoking \u201cveto\u201d authority, allows Congress to spend one trillion dollars ($1,200,000,000,000) more than in collected tax dollars. Adds to the national debt and higher interest payments, thus less money for future American programs.\n\nInvolving America in wars in Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen. Taiwan next?  Higher defense expenditures to come soon. Diminishing America\u2019s respectability in the world\u2019s eyes. Started in Afghanistan\u2019s \u201crunning scared\u201d retreat.\n\nLosing track of security documents in numerous places. Although no charges by the Justice Department,  the report included a highly critical evaluation of Biden\u2019s mental fitness, describing him as an \u201celderly man with a poor memory.\u201d \nThe report referred to the president\u2019s memory as \u201chazy,\u201d \u201csignificantly limited,\u201d \u201cfaulty,\u201d and \u201cpoor.\u201d Joe will take a physical test, but will not take a mental acuity test.  Not very high qualifications  for a 2024 Democratic Presidential nominee.\n\nFor years as a grandfather, Joe  ignored and shut out one of his  grandchildren, fathered by his son, Hunter. Joe only recognized his granddaughter when she became a \u201cpolitical hot potato\u201d. This demonstrates a lack of responsibility and character as a person.\n\nJoe knows what the world climate will look like in 2050, thus America needs to spend trillions of dollars, for the \u201cgreening of America\u201d to happen. Heck, my weather person cannot tell me if the upcoming winter is going to be dryer or wetter than usual, or colder or warmer than usual. Pretty smart guy to know what the world weather will be in 26 years.\n\nAfter three years, I think the American public is tired of Joe using \u201cMAGA\u201d Republicans as the reason for his issues and problems. When you took the oath of office, you became \u201caccountable\u201d for what happens during your watch. Stand up and take responsibility for your actions.\n\nBlaming others may make you feel better, but it does not solve the issue or problem. The American people would rather see you try to solve the problem, than to blame someone else. If someone else caused your problem, the American people already know that fact.  Joe, they elected you to solve problems, not pass \u201cthe buck\u201d.\n\nAlso, Trump enacted tax cuts will expire Dec 31, 2024. Unless reenacted, doubtful under a Biden election win, $4 trillion dollars will shift from American pocketbooks to government coffers. Another $2 trillion dollars of taxes is also being examined.",

As the Houston Chronicle said, \"Biden on his worst day is smarter, more alert, more competent, and more knowledgeable than Trump on his best day.\"  I might have added a bit to the newspaper's words.

    "You know using the excuse that Biden is too old is just a way for fake Biden people trumpsters basically to get rid of Biden , because only trumpsters would want to get rid of Biden after all of the things he has done for us, so anybody who says he is too old you are a secret trumpster",

    "Not that I disagree with the main points that Mr. O'Donnell is raising, but I think that it's worth pointing out that if Nixon was so sure that he was going to win in 1968, why did he feel the necessity of secretly (and illegally) negotiating with the North Vietnamese to make sure that no peace deal was made before the election.  Also, while the events at the convention and the bitterness of the McCarthy supporters certainly played into Nixon's hands, Humphrey's unwillingness to distance himself from LBJ until it was too late to make enough of a difference seems to have been at least as significant a factor in the result of the election; the polls at the time indicated that Humphrey was gaining on Nixon.  In addition, there was the candidacy of George Wallace as well - if Wallace had not run, it's quite possible that Nixon's margin of victory would have been much larger, since Wallace took away many more votes from Nixon than he did from Humphrey.\n\nIn my opinion, what the Democrats have to figure out is (a) how to use their money more effectively to fund that candidacies of Democratic candidates in down-ticket races; (b) how to convince the so-called \"progressives\" that Trump and Biden are not equivalent and to prevent them from repeating the mistake they made in 2000 and then again in 2016, by throwing away enough votes on a Politically Correct candidate to give the election to the Republican.",

    "You are 100% correct on the flim-flam of today's reporters and news reporting. They have the mindset of the 7-year-old IQ Trump sycophants. I'm totally disgusted with them. I thank God for MSNBC and their responsible reporting of truth. It would not surprise me that a bunch of \"phony\" reporters are being dressed up by Fox and other conservative news (sic) bureaus to drown out, even shout out, legitimate reporters to make sure their flim-flam nothingness gets top recording. This is how corrupt and freedom-hating Fox and their kind really are. I have a few things I would like to happen to Trump and his kind, including Fox, et al, that I can't mention here. But, I could go on and on about \"Christian ethics\" which Trump and his sycophants are trampling on, one after the other. A very basic ethic is, \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" The CPAC people must be cursing the Bible for even containing such blasphemy. Let's try, \"Love one another as I have loved you.\" Who spoke that one? According to Republican actions, the person who uttered that must be both ignorant and stupid. The Republican party absolutely refutes and even denounces these two simple Christian principles. Should we mention \"Love thy neighbor as thyself\"? How about the New Testament with, \"God is Love.\" I don't believe any of these concepts are even in the Republican consciousness. The Republicans are on a Christian \"charade.\" They are phony as Christians, making a mockery of Christ Jesus and everything he taught and demonstrated. They neither talk the talk nor walk the walk of Christianity. They foment evil, and not even in disguise. They are anti-Christ. They have put a phony \"orange Jesus\" as their head honcho. That in itself is sacrilegious. How anti-Christ can they get? As a Christian, I declare them disgusting...Anyway, thank you again MSNBC for carrying the banner of truth over the Republican onslaught of nothing but lies, chaos, and their attempted overthrow and destruction of freedom and democracy here in America and everywhere else in the free world. Let us march together to defeat them in 2024 and hopefully rid the world of their threats to freedom and democracy. How they turned their grievances, which we all have, into a black hole of hate, I will never understand.",
    "Dear Mr. Lawrence. President Biden is Competent and a Skilled Politician and Fit for leadership of The United States. His Statemanship is a Blessing to The Nation and to the People of The United States. His age is a plus to his experience as a World leader. He is definitely the Best Leader we have for our Country. I am Glad to see and know That Mr. Gavin Newsome supports our President. An will be available to take leadership behind Biden in the Future per our country decide that we need him in the future . In the Mean time President Biden has my support and the support of my mother Grace, who adores him and our Votes he can count on. I am happy Biden is working and leading our country and is keeping sanctions on Putin and I pray That the American people who love America and who love the Constitution will come out in mass and Support President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harrison. I also applaud you Mr Lawrence you are an excellent Journalist and a American True Patriot. Please keep up your excellent work and support of our beloved Country. Thank you Sir.",
    "Yeah, how about lets let the Republicans have the \"exciting TV\" convention. \nAnd you hit the nail on the head sir. The people concerned about Biden's age almost universally seem to have a problem with Harris. I won't claim she's my favorite politician, or even my favorite black female politician, but she seems professional and competant. She is certainly not unqualified for the job, whereas the presumptive Republican nominee is indeed unqualified.",
    "Frankly, with all due repect to Lawrence I feel he contradicts and actually argues against his point in this segment. Lawrence almost had me up until the end where he brought Roosevelt into his arguement and it went off the tracks for me there. Roosevelt was supported by the people and was thought to be competent by the people due to his public appearences despite his health condition. So if Lawrence is going to use that arguement, then it would stand to reason that if both Presidents were doing a good job policy wise, Biden would not have a problem if he was also able to demonstrate/portray the same public competence. To dismiss that part of the presidency seems suspect to me. I fully respect Lawrence and think he does a good job generally but this was a poor arguement imo. If he wanted to argue that Biden could be better publicly and his age is causing him some difficulty but he is still capable as evidence shows even if his public persona is not great. I would still be fully on board if Lawrence only argued that due to Bidens accomplishments and desired direction for the country he is a far better choice then trump for president even if his public confidence has been diminished due to his age. But to scold the electorate for wanting a publicly competent president when most already gave Biden a pass last election is a very poor way to convince people to vote for Biden again. Especially since the Democratic party didn't seem to learn its lesson last time, or the time before with Hillary, and did not seem to even try to provide a better candidate this time. With the perceived existential threat to democracy felt by many if there is another trump presidency. It is really sad that those leading the democratic party still haven't woken up to the concerns of the majority of the people affiliated to their party",

If one cola is losing its fizz and the other cola is laced with a mysterious flavor enhancer that is potentially poisonous, the consumer will wish for an alternative. If there is no alternative the consumer may well choose the risky drink because it still satisfies in the moment. and the ones making the poison charge have a conflict of interest.

    "One of the worst appearances. I do not like how these establishment personalities are blaming the impending democratic defeat on the voters.

    "This is outstanding journalism! Plain and simply an excellent piece! It brings up just how very sad the state of journalism is today when this is so much better for its depth, research, and understanding. Lawrence O'Donnell should be praised for this kind of effort and for the kind of expertise he demonstrated for his much less experienced colleagues. How we miss this kind of work. As a proud New Englander who resides in Maine, I can't share enough appreciation for this work!\n\nPeople need to realize that we have the right person, the right leader, and the right human being running for re-election! There are no easy, quick answers when you battle against extremism. There is a clear choice because there is a \"Clear and Present Danger!\" People need to stand up and make it!",

    "I will never forget the 1968 Democratic convention. What we saw on TV was horrifying. We had never seen anything like that before on TV - or for most of us, anywhere else.

    "Joe Biden may be slowing down physically but his mind is still sharp. I have confidence in him and his cabinet doing the right thing for the American people. I look forward to the day that Trump is gone and politics can return to semi normal. VOTE BLUE \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99",
    "\"The presidential campaign is four years long\" - In the third quarter of this understanding, which is to say last year, Biden had the second worst approval rating of any president in the polling era.

    "It occurs to me that the main stream press cling to simple tropes, such as ageist standards (80+ too old) because they are tailoring the content to the average American viewer (simplistic pedestrian concepts). The press is always decades behind and to his credit, Trump upended the status quo definition of an electable candidate. Trump was able to pull this off solely based on his charisma and deluded narcissistic confidence and also because his base were more flexible and eager to embraced this unconventional persona. Democratic lawmakers and democratic voters are largely quite craven, pearl clutching and orthodox in comparison. I am an independent voter and I loath Trump/GOP more than I do Biden.",

    "True. It's likely too late, which is a shame. And there were many who said this long ago. The go along to get along media will be held accountable for their complicity if Trump wins.\n\nAnd you TOTALLY miss the point re the polls. The DNC, who gave us Trump by anointing HRC in 2016, immediately cooked the primaries for Biden by skipping over the two early states that Biden was clobbered in in 2020. The message that the party bosses already made their habitually bad choice was lost on no one. Shame on them, shame on Biden and shame on you.\n\nThe 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court was in part caused by RBG treating herself as so inexpendable during Obama's term that she lasted part way in the MAGA era and the rest is history. Add the DNC bumbling in 2016 and you see why many people don't view the DNC establishment as the saviors of democracy they try to portray themselves as. \n\nYou seldom make anywhere as much sense as you think you do but this is a new low.",
    "Funny that Lawrence used an airplane analogy, describing Joe Biden as the pilot that got us to Ireland over the Atlantic. \nThe thing is that take off and LANDING are the most dangerous times in a flight.

We cannot afford to have these stupid discussions of Biden's age, etc.  The media should know better!  Thank God we have Lawrence to set the record straight.  \n\nI also really appreciated the review of the 1968 convention--a convention I am old enough to remember but still needed a refresher.  \n\nThank you, Lawrence, for your brilliance, your commitment, your dedication to truth telling.",

    "A contested convention is a sign of the serious dissatisfaction of party members.  That dissatisfaction results in the inability of people to align behind a candidate and that causes the contested convention.  That dissatisfaction and inability to align behind a candidate results in people being unenthusiastic about voting, so they stay home and the party's candidate loses the election.  \nThere is a fair amount of misinformation in this.  There is also a fair amount of voter shaming.  \nI am a Bernie supporter.  In 2020, after the DNC put their hand on the scale for a second time, I switched my party affiliation to the Green Party in protest. I fully intended to vote for Howie Hawkins until Trump would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power during a Presidential Debate.  Then I relented because we could not allow Trump to stay in office regardless of how I felt.  \nThat said, Biden has been better than most people have given him credit for.  The Biden admin has forgiven several billion dollars of student debt for several million people.  While Biden stopped the railroad strike, his administration continued negotiations between the railroads and the unions and got many of the concessions for the unions.  Not to mention, Biden's department of labor has been fantastic for workers and unions.  The infrastructure bill, while not perfect has been great for the economy.  The biggest current problem has been in the middle east where a spoiled child has been abusing it's poor neighbor for generations and the spoiled child is unwilling to stop because they are used to their favored status that caused them to be spoiled.\nI appreciate the people that running in the Primary against Biden (not RFK Jr. though) but they were always going to lose.  Cenk Uyger is plainly ineligible though, the Constitution the same way a 20 year old is ineligible for office.  I like Marianne Williamson, but she lacks the job experience that Biden has.  Both of them running and the votes they get send Biden a message about what people want.  I will likely vote for Marianne Williamson to strengthen that message.  But in the general election I will vote for whoever has the best chance of beating Trump, even if the candidate that had the best chance was a unsliced loaf of bread.",

The knee-jerk response that prevented Hillary Clinton from being elevated to the Presidency is still a factor - the common folk are tired of self-serving politicians. The last time I checked, the President hadn't addressed that issue at all...or the undue influence of the military industrial complex, as Eisenhower warned. Yes, yes, President Biden has done other things in remarkable circumstances - but he doesn't inspire U.S. citizens to aspire, or seem to have a vision for the future. Political leaders have become the managerial class for corporate America. That's the biggest problem you face - the illusion of democracy, the illusion of choice, and the illusion of freedom.",

Betting all on the idea that people will be motivated to vote against Trump is somewhat of a gambit.",

One thing is certain and two things are sure Trump has been telling everyone what it is he really wants to do time and time again ( people need to stop being delusional thinking his agenda is here to benefit them).  It\u2019s time for people to drown out the noise and really listen to what he/Trump is saying.  As my mother used to always say I can show you better than I can tell you.  In Trumps case he has said and shown the US many things.. stop being impressed (drawn in by his rhetoric) by his words and look at his actions; they are not for the benefit of everyone living in this country they are to position him for his end game.",

    "A remarkable speech Lawrence! well since I came here to live in America from the Caribbean in 2019 to join my American citizen spouse at that time a person handed me a piece of paper with Joe Biden picture and I said he would be the next president of the USA and up until I got my citizenship I have been a democrat and what we as Democrats must do is rally behind the Leadership of President Joe Biden because is the only one who has the vision for the American people and so we as Democrat should elect the president unopposed and not have no democrat challenging the president we as democrat must realized that there is a monster that is with friend with one of our greatest enemy! that monster doesn't respect the law or Democracy, so Joe Biden is the greatest president of the United States at the moment because only him can bring back democracy",
    "This is an honest question... Why do they pick the only poll that show Biden ahead of Trump...?... Quinnipiac even said the poll showing Biden ahead is an outlier... Every single poll besides that one has Trump ahead by leads of 4-10 point, so I'm just wondering if this is a news program.. why not show the totality of the evidence and let the ppl of America know the truth?",

    "A very worthy half hour to consume & absorb. Biden represents, relies and has faith in a large body of appointed and elected people to make the decisions and change the conditions as voted by the will of we the people.Biden is a team player, capable of negociation and accepting across the aisle change. Trump is a self indulged one man, no compromise show, just as all the maga influencers are self isolationists, no aisles to cross for anybody, aisles are for traitors, it's my way or the highway, talking over each other for short singular attention spans. Nothing gets done, That's how they roll.  Simply look at the insane administration turnover, resigns, fires, quits & replacements during Trump's term, how many lasted the 4 years?, as opposed to any turnovers in Biden's administration. Should speak volumes for national and civil cohesiveness. I worry about Bidens age, but not for aptitude or judgements sake, many of us over 70 consider mortality and live life on a day to day basis. Biden is still heeding and succeeding in his long life's calling, as a public servant. While Trump spent his life riding alone in a self inflicted roller coaster at the expense of all who ever crossed his hair brained path & rode for any of his knock off brands.",

Just what Speaker Johnson letting tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives be lost under Trump's tutelage is, should be enough for people to see how diabolical Trump is and just what a desperate danger he is to this country and to the world. The signs are all there: what a terrible, sad pity the American Public are quite willing to sign their own, literal, death sentence, and pull the rest of us down to a painful oblivion. See what happens in South Africa where the majority 'vota ANC' and chant 'Killa da Wite man, killa da Boer,' to their own detriment, election after election. Madness, just insanity.

Not filming in the oval office has never been different sir whatever you're allowed to do now is the same you've always been allowed to do so it's not that the filming is a problem it's that your candidate is not doing the job and you guys would never show that so obviously you have to make up a lie about why you're not allowed to put it on film or why he's never on! We witnessed pelosi holding his arm and hand in the same way that you see nursing assistants holding onto the feeble patience of a nursing home. Here's something that you guys don't seem to understand that I wish you did but I will not hold my breath cuz I know you're not going to do it, you would actually gain more trust and possibly even swing some Independence back to Joe Biden if you would just simply stop lying just stop lying stop trying to manipulate stop giving fake information stop pretending like the man isn't old and feeble. ( The report that just came out about him said he was too old to even be charged with the crimes he was guilty of sir I mean if you're so weak and feeble that you can't even Defend yourself in a court proceeding then surely you should not be running an entire country especially not this country maybe he can go apply to be the president of Iceland or Greenland.",

But true to the lawlessness of the Democrats today, you feel that there was an injustice done because a certain group didn't get what they wanted? So more or less you are demonstrating the very lawlessness that is angering the American people today because you are criticizing the fact that our system worked exactly the way it was supposed to! What would you rather would you rather they did what the Democrats did in 2016 with the Russia hoax? Or maybe what they did in Fulton county in 2020?

I take that back how many liberal black women who don't have any common sense? No we could bring up Fannie since the cell phone pings have proven that she's possibly committed perjury as a D.A. but.... Maybe we don't need Fanny maybe we can look at the mayor in Chicago who thinks she's a reality TV star and tells the trustees that she doesn't have to answer to them for how she spends the money. Or maybe we could look at Leticia James who just single-handedly destroyed the entire economy of New York based on the testimony of known very wealthy men. This means the women that would vote for Kamala adds up to about 3 right now and all three of them are in hot water. Please don't insult the intelligence of people sir.",
    "11:26--- Sir, all due respect I must point out a very simple truth that you obviously do not see otherwise you wouldn't have made this segment such a big deal. The reason Trump does not have as much money going toward his campaign is because he has millions upon millions upon millions of voters already dedicated to voting for him which means he does not have to spend hardly any money to campaign because most of that money is going towards trying to convince people of the candidate but Trump already has that means he literally could spend 1:20 ....  you get the point. It's the equivalent of someone who is not very good at selling real estate has to spend a lot of money to advertise but someone who has a proven track record and a huge following doesn't have to spend any money at all because they're getting free campaigning from all the people that are already dedicated. I would choose a different topic sir this one is not gaining any favor for Joe Biden it actually makes him look worse that he has to spend all that money.",

I would advocate for that man to the point that people would think he was my own personal savior! Gavin newsom would be Satan's child incarnate.

These 20 are not only congressional terrorists, they are domestic terrorists. By doing what they are doing, by demanding what THEY want and refusing to do their duty until they have it, is holding ALL AMERICANS, whether republican, democrat, or independent, HOSTAGE!

Do we really want people in congress who are more interested in grabbing power than they are in helping to lead our country and keeping their promise to support and defend the Constitution?

This is what we're doing.\r\nAnd the reality is that there were children kidnapped, babies. Kidnapped toddlers kidnapped children killed. To me, it sounds like it's also from a society point of view. A moral failing is that we can't agree or disagree on whatever side you want, but we should be able to agree Hamas is wrong. Come on since it's a moral issue.\r\nAnd here's the big thing. All of these people that are marching right, there's  200 hostages. That's right. And nobody's marching for   them.

My former Bishop was Black, and I can't tell you how disappointed I was in his political stance. He wanted to be something that he's not. Fast foward to 45's first few months, my daughter called me crying. She had become a youth Pastor with her husband. She literally cried and called out the hypocrisy the Magazine. She said in 8 years, she never saw 1 decent article or message asking for sincere prayer for President Obama. Focus on word sincere. But day 1 of 45's all the so-called prophecies  of great things and loving prayers we're being bestowed upon him. She contrasted it with Obama...and guess what....she became WOKE. She was shocked when I told her I knew what she just found out and had stopped my subscription years before. She screamed, \"why didn't you tell me?\" My reply, because your faith, like mine is between you and God and I had faith that she would come to the true knowledge of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, whether I said something or not.

( no impeachment is required to remove an insurrectionist, ** maybe this is not necessary, if not do not include it.  we are not sending the insurrectionist to jail, just blocking them from the positions defined by the constitution ).\n\nthe state court may rule an individual is an insurrectionist as defined by the constitution, including amendment 14 section 3.  if that ruling is not appealed the individual is libel for insurrection.  if the ruling is appealed and upheld by the state's highest court, the individual is libel for insurrection.  an individual who is libel for insurrection may not hold and may not be appointed or be elected to any state office as defined by the constitution.  if an individual is found libel for insurrection in at least 3 states, that individual is libel for insurrection in all states and the federal government, and may not be appointed or be elected to or hold any office state or federal requiring an oath to uphold the constitution. \nif an insurrectionist wins an election the person may not serve and the winner of the election is the person with the 2nd highest vote count.  if there is no such person, the election is void.  the insurrectionist was never elected and does not hold the office.   if an insurrectionist already holds an office as defined in the constitution, that individual may not serve and must be removed from office without further litigation.",

Does the American experiment go silently into the night or do those who hold onto their idealism roll up their sleeves, get their hands dirty, and push back?..

    "I don\u2019t disagree with the comments. However, large swaths of people are blind to racism, thinking in terms of a one-person by one-person, one-event at a time mindset where any one person can justify away (lie to others and more likely themselves) discriminatory actions as to any single action at a time . . . but it\u2019s when you look at the macro-data that you see the racism uncovered.  \n\nSo then, because people are willfully blind to racism, when they hear people discussing the term casually (assuming their audience grasps understanding of underlying facts), all they can hear is that there is a mean person calling people names (racists) and then are deaf to the content of the discourse.  This is wrong and unfair, but the problem is that for a huge portion of the audience that is the filter through which they hear the content.  \n\nMy point is that there are underlying facts that should be commonly understood and accepted so that, theoretically, the topic should be able to be discussed in shorthand (assuming commonly understood underlying facts), . . . but . . . unfortunately in my opinion, at this time, that is not possible, at least for many audiences, including YouTube-clip audiences.  The solution would be to strive to always have examples, studies, etc., on hand to include in a conversation when racism is mentioned to the degree that is possible/feasible.  I know this is controversial because people should know better (because it is a matter of willful ignorance) so it is acquiescing to racism by having to be over-prepared to explain and defend when the topic comes up, and it is also in itself discriminatory (that you can\u2019t use that term unless you\u2019re over-prepared and/or willing to make your discourse more cumbersome) . . but the problem is no matter how much your audience should be grownups and should be able to reach the kitchen counter, if the reality is that they are toddlers, then you gotta put stepladders out if you want them to reach the items you are laying there.\n\nIn the case of this clip, I think there were some portions where a large portion of the audience would be basically plugging their ears and saying \u201cna na na-na na, I can\u2019t hear you\u201d because that is their knee jerk response to that term whenever racism is discussed without laying out the underlying facts of why that term is justified.",

    "We have to realize that Americans are suffering under our progressive policies that have proven to be disastrous. We went from an economy that was moving forward with an 8% rate of growth and a 1.4% rate of inflation through the worst economy since 2008. we have runaway inflation. Across-the-board, we have suffered through three economic orders of negative growth which signal the beginning of the Biden recession. Some economists are now beginning to whisper the possibility of a Biden\u2019s depression. While job growth is continuing, and wages are increasing, the rate of inflation is stealing money out of the pocket books of hard-working Americans. America\u2019s foreign-policy is a laughingstock.\n    We need to turn this economy around and stop making life better for the entrenched political class and begin concentrating on making life better for hard-working Americans. Joe has to stop turning his back on the American people. We see nothing but ineptitude out of Washington, the disastrous way that Pete handled the train derailment is a good example. Then he was trying to blame everything on Trump.  Pete needs to go. He is a terrible embarrassment.\n    So, when Republicans are talking about how wrong America is, they are reflecting the values of the best majority of hard-working Americans.

This has gone on for so long that no matter what you do or say he will win in 2024. And I will be rolling on the floor in laughter as you all cry out with the words \"I'm melting.

All Trump needs to  do is to suspend the Constitution.\nThat will be his first act as Dictator. He will not be stopped by the Secret Service because the majority of agents will support him.\n\n3.  With the Constitution gone, Trump will have no need for a Congress, a Cabinet, or a Supreme Court.  He will dismiss them all if he wants to - BECAUSE HE CAN.\n\n4.  In the absence of the Legislative and Judicial Branches, he will rule by fiat and order the Military - sans anyone of High Rank who opposes him - to enforce his Decrees.\n\n5.  There will be no resistance because Trump will empower everyone who voted for him to act as his vigilantes, confiscating any weapons in the hands of anyone who did not vote for him.\n\n6. Meanwhile, he will have Concentration Camps built for Political Enemies who will work on massive farms producing food for loyal MAGAts, the Military, the Secret Police, and any others Trump needs to keep run America like a giant Gulag.\n\nIt takes only one act - the suspension of the Constitution- to enable every possible outrage against humanity that Dictator Donald can imagine. \n\nWithout the Constitution, there is no legal impediment for Trump to overcome and no legal basis for anyone to act against him.\n\nThis is why Trump must be stopped before November, 2024. He must be kept off the Ballot. That is now the only way to derail the Trump Express.",

A dictator has no need of courts, lawyers or judges when there is no rule of law.   I\u2019ll tell you what one of the first acts that will happen.  Trump and his people will be rounding up all the guns, since the gun is about the only thing that removes a dictator from power.   Just putting him back in office, after what he has done, would be death of the Constitution and the rule of law.  He would have no real valid claim to the Presidency anymore since the Constitution that gives that power would be gone.   And that goes for everyone else\u2019s claims as well.

If Obama was heard on tape saying he would have more flexibility after being re-elected, you can multiply that by 10x or more if Trump gets elected.

    "Dear Mrs. Jen Paski, and Mr. James Comey: It is my idea that an ankle bracelet does not do any good because still would provide freedom of movement and the frequency and signal can also be emulated. Furthermore, an ankle bracelet can be potentially blocked, by means of blocking the actual emitter signal with different type shields. So,  Rather than an ankle bracelet, - plus considering that un precedent situations, require un precedent solutions, it would be far more useful a computerized controlled mouthpiece. Something perhaps customized or custom designed within the size of a breathing mask. Just the same type of those we were using during the pandemic days. This may be have to be worn same as the ankle bracelet. The bracelet, would potentially report the location moves. But with this electronic mouthpiece mask around his mouth, it can be programmable via remotely, to allow for intervals for conversations, like, lets say, i.e.: allowed to speak every three minutes. And the speech would last, lets say, for example, i.e.:  for about 45 seconds at the time. - \nThis way Trump would not only be having a reduction control to his threats, yet, it would be in a sense also be \"...controlling....\" what he says.\nNot only this type of \"mouthpiece mask\" can be programmable for timing intervals, yet also can recording what it comes out of his own mouth. This can be done on either replaceable memory chips, and or erasable memory, that can be reset via mini USB, while actually recharging at the same time. - The less he speaks the longer the charge of the speaking mouthpiece lasts.\nSo, no matter what he says or promise, cuss, or describes,  It will be recorded, and the device may have the option to broadcast to other devices. Something like the correlation of the monitoring of the ankle bracelet. So, someone would be monitoring what he says. or  better say, every single word that comes out of his destructive mouth. -\nThe technology is there. And the beast to use this creative device, is there too. - So, why not? \nLet me know if you like my design and or my comment.",

Now we are wondering if you guys are the ones running Biden. Since you have so much dirt on him, you can threaten him with prison time and make him do exactly what you want. now that we see how criminal you guys are, we wouldn\u2019t put this past you",

    "Here\u2019s another thing I realized you guys have been illegally looking into every single thing that Donald Trump does. Meaning you know everything he has done for the last 50 years. And you haven\u2019t found anything really badly criminal.??? you have even tapped his phone and done investigations of every single thing he has done. If he was really so bad you would\u2019ve had a really big case against him. Does everyone see what I\u2019m saying? You have done nothing but look into him. Why haven\u2019t you found something huge?",
    "Here\u2019s what you guys aren\u2019t realizing. We all have looked into this now and know that you guys have lied to us so much that nothing you say means anything anymore. All of us believe that Donald Trump was racist because of people like you. All of us believe Russia was interfering in our elections because of you. Do you realize how painful it was to find out that you were lying the whole time??? You guys have damaged yourself. What we have started doing is watching the hearings that happened in Congress And by doing that we have learned the truth. If we are looking at this like who is a good guy and who is the bad guy. You guys are the bad guys and I hope whoever gets in cleans up this disgusting mess.",

Many who are our enemies.  And sitting down with Comey, who was fired and implicated by the inspector general, for being corrupt and recommended his prosecution, is why the media can\u2019t be trusted, pushing their propaganda, and lies and corruption for the Democommunist party",

Idiots win the game but 2024, it is OVER. OVER for you!",

And for an on-again-off-again; cannot decide what is right and what is wrong, and what the FBI policies are for a presidential candidate entering an election; Comey is the last person anyone would want to get advice from. The FBI under Comey did its job to steal another election (Bush v Gore) for the Republicans, and Comey's actions to destroy a presidential candidate took less than 6 weeks prior to election day. Today, the DOJ and FBI have taken 6 years, 2 impeachments, 3 DOJ investigations, over +30,000 lies, and Trump is still not in prison (as well as his accomplices). American's have been waiting a long time for justice; It would be a letdown for this country if this justice system further delays Trump's indictment and jury trial, and allow him to continue to run for president. Trump is a criminal, and this travesty of justice must end, or we could see Trump selling arms to Putin, and the Biden's in prison like Alexei Navalny.",

Whats Funny is Comey Helped get trump Elected and then got Fired by trump.",

Hence Russian election interference and pres. chump.\n people got to stop watching so much tv. I think political ad should be a paid for 1/2 program for each candidate to be run weekly until the election. Then there could be no flip-flopping or denial of ill thought out statements.

    "Let's think logically and not hypothetically, Comey.  He shouldn't worry if he did nothing wrong.  This double speak makes it seem like he has much to hide. All his actions resulted in a big fat mess.  Why doesn't he say this in Congress or in court if there is something that needs to be divulged. Trying to come clean a little too late.",
    "The man said a mouth full. \"It has to be Joe Biden in 2024\". I personally would rather see Joe Biden even if pushed around on a gerney with a I.V. in his arm because he would still have more active brain function than anything the Republican Party can come with. Right now & from what I can see. The Republican Party candidates are like a feather in the wind. Swaying towards power any way it blows. Complete absence of any ethics.",
    "Its partially this guy's fault we ended up with Trump in the first place. Has everyone forgotten about that? It was his big press announcement right before everyone went to the voting booths that basically said a whole lot of nothing but did effectively cast doubt on Hilary Clinton. She played her part in losing by assuming she had it in the bag, but they have this guy up here like we were supposed to have forgotten about him by now.",

Sounds like he just might be worried that he will finally be forced to defend his years of corrupt criminal conduct in court and under oath?",

For decades, they were only accepting bribes from the extremely rich and corporations in order to get favorable legislation regarding taxes and specific industries passed. That's changed in the last decade to include their accepting funds from foreign countries with the intent to spy on, and covertly destroy the integrity, government infrastructure, general health and wellbeing of the population, and ultimately replace our Constitutional democracy with a dictatorship. Even those of us who have been raised as Republicans must recognize that our commitment to America is primary before Party. While we still have the right to vote, I suggest that we all commit to voting Completely Democratic for the next several election cycles in order to override the gerrymanders and to give the Democratic leadership enough of a majority in order to finally pass essential legislation to both protect us from future foreign coup attempts and to help bring America back in line with other countries.

HE WOULD NOT.\nTrump would rip up everything and set himself as a dictator with total control over all aspects of government and law enforcement. he would probably keep the institutional; names of Congress and the Senate but he would take all their powers for himeslf leaving them as merely a puppet show, rubber-stamping every edict he issued.\nThere would be no fair trials. Juries and judges would follow his orders and those orders would be enforced by his own Praetorian guard, the Prooud Boys and Oathkeepers that he would appoint to key law enforcement positions.\nIf trump gets in again, you can kiss American democracy goodbye.",

It is beyond absurd that he could be in any way shape or form a contender for 2024. It's also very foreign to me how a possible upcoming criminal case can be discussed so openly and in such detail in the media, as if it was a football game. And there's nothing unusual about this interview, you can watch dozens of similar ones every week. If it happened here in Ireland the defendant would argue that he couldn't possibly get a fair trial and it would take the judge about two seconds to send everyone home.",
    "All you voters, think about what would happen if Trump got the nod.  Don't vote for someone who lies, is a tax dogger.  Everything he touches goes bankrupt.  Look at his media company as an example.  Anyone who goes against him ends up in jail or worse.  He's a dictator Wana bee, and doing a good job at it.  He's worse than a television evangelist raking in millions of your hard-earned dollars for promising something he'll never give you, while spending it on himself.

    "At this point, I question the whole GOP for even supporting Donald Trump as a presidential candidate. He already said if he loses the republican primaries he will not support the republican presidential nominee. He also said he will skip the first republican primaries.

    "a voice from the UK . . . . Iammightily confused about your system of governance. Your constitution says no-one is above the law, including former presidents. I appreciate that, whilst in office, the President is afforded certain 'protections'. Whilst there may be no previous legal precident, Trump has said that, should he get back into office, he will change the constitution. Surely  this  is setting a precident. This can mean only one thing, should he get into office the US vs Donald Trump will NEVER happen and your country will fall into the abyss. What Trump is manufacturing, right now, is anarachy. Another point, Trump is, clearly, mentally unfit for office, is there no other way, now he is a citizen that his mind be  professionally assessed and, if found to be mentally unfit, he be prevented from even standing for office?",
    "I used to watch Jen deliver her daily sessions, back when she was Biden's first press secretary and was always impressed by how calm and articulate she was, in the face of some deeply depressing questions from certain sectors of the press corps.

Even if that spineless coward Garland agreed to indict him (which he never will!), any federal trial would probably not start for a year and couldn't conclude before the next election so once Trump becomes President again (which he will because voters want strong leaders not these cowards!) then he will just pardon himself. Everyone knows there's an unwritten rule in Washington that no former President or former or sitting members of Congress will EVER be prosecuted for any crime and the fact that Biden named Garland who then named Smith who issued hundreds of subpoenas and slow walked all the grand juries just to let Trump off the hook is all the proof you need! \ud83e\udd2c",

Watch old filmed footage of the \"good\" German people cheering on their charismatic toothbrush mustachioed \"saviour\" and then play some footage of a rally held by the Orange Menace. See the open hatred? The glee with which his remarks of misogyny and bigotry are received?

    "I am surprised to hear Mr Comey say he still doesn't know why Trump is enthralled with Putin. Perhaps he is feigning ignorance as a means of underscoring an exasperatingly obvious reality but here is the explanation and it is simple: Trump has a severe case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. It is so all consuming that Trump is bereft of morality, kindness, or empathy. He admires and identifies with powerful people. Putin was born into modest means. His father was a sailor and his mother helped ends meet by working in a factory. Today Putin is worth north of 100 billion dollars. All of it was stolen from the Russian people. This thrills Trump and solidifies his notion that Putin is admirable.Trump wishes he were as \"successful\".",

And if your senses dont comply, you're promoting a big lie.

    "As Comey knows, Trump ,could actually be in jail and still be elected and possibly serve (!) as President, especially since his Party continues to hate him and be afraid of his followers at the same time.

Comey himself got used by Trump and his own sense of righteousness In violating the FBI rule to not make statements close to an election.",

It undermines everythng to do with stability, and strength of leadership. It seems to me, and many others, that America needs to come of age and recognize that absolute freedoms do not exist and cannot, simply because of the nature of human beings and that with every right comes responsibility.",
    "How is it that a person who is convicted cannot vote but can be elected President ????? The Biden administration should be blamed if this happens especially after events of Jan 6th \u2026 Trump did the country a favor while he was in office by showing us all that could go wrong if a dictator is elected President  and how easy it is for it to happen . The Congress has done absolutely nothing to fix this ???? Really ?????",

By opening an investigation into Hillary Clinton just 11 days before the US election, it was probably just enough to get Trump over the line.  \nHe should either opened and possibly completed the investigation well before the election, or waited until it was over.",

Comey still defends his treacherous actions which resulted in trump taking over the presidency and fracturing the foundation of our democratic republic.",
    "This is indeed a very strange turn of happenings: having a president who is convicted of a crime. It looks like nobody understands what causes this, it is caused by not having a real political party where people who want to represent the party must be approved by the members of the party.\nIt seems in the US every lunatic with enough money to pay for advertisements can say I'm a republican and I will run for president.",

Let\u2019s not forget how the right reacts when their choice for president doesn\u2019t win. Just like Putin\u2019s dictatorship, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s way or no way. Yet they (Trump supporters) have the balls to shout \u201cAmerica, Liberty and Freedom\u201d.",

    "I got my fingers crossed...  If they're looking for a good place to lock Trump and his traitors up, they should consider Fort Jefferson -- in the Gulf of Mexico, 70 miles west of Key West Florida. If it was good enough for Dr. Mudd of the Lincoln Assassination fame, it should be good enough for Trump and his traitors.",
    "I certainly hope and pray Trump is prosecuted before even a chance of re-election. He's a very dangerous man who has truly divided our country and will absolutely do even more if he is re-elected.  Someone has got to stop this horrible man..our country as we've known it will never recover if he gets re-elected again. How is he even permitted to seek the nomination under tge circumstances???\ud83d\ude22",
    "If Trump is not voted as a person who may not be in any elected position by congress, we need to rid ourselves of the scum.  This interview is interesting as Comey violated DOJ 'rules' in 2016 and was very instrumental in bringing us to this disastrous place.  And Russia is already at it.  The trolls have multiplied, the republicans are accepting and using Russian propaganda against Biden, and the 'othering' of various groups is meant to distract, not inform.  Please, everyone, make sure you vote in every election.  It may be our only way out of this mess.",

Trump couldn't use Comey so he made up a reason to fire him, turned the IRS on him and slandered him and his family.  People need to pay attention to what Comey is saying he's had an inside view of what Trump is capable of and how far he will go.  America wake up!!!!",
    "Trump's blame only goes so far. The biggest share goes to the extremely ignorant backwoods MAGA fools. Just like with Trump the grifter in the present, their ancestors bought remedies from the snake oil salesman when he came to town. Even though that stuff did more harm than good, when that salesman came back around those fools bought again, and he laughed at them all the way to the bank. The ignorant have always been easy marks for scammers and grifters.",

A long time ago there was a character in a Heavy Metal magazine story who was president, pope, and dictator of the world and he resembled Drumpf very much. I didn't think much of it then. It scares me to death now. We simply cannot let this man be selected president again. I will help move Heaven and Earth to prevent that from happenning. Biden/Harris 2024 Long live democracy and freedom!",
    "The amount of insanity it takes to take CNN or MSNBC seriously, is frightening. They always admitted they had classified documents as they were in discussions as to how to handle them.

Of course,  he can't write non fiction anymore. His nonfiction is less believable.",

For the rest of his life McCain couldn\u2019t lift his arms above his shoulders from repeatedly being hung from ceilings by his wrists tied behind his back for hours at a time. Yet McCaine's service and sacrifices is mocked by semi-literate cruel imbecility, deceit, Hatetriotism and Faketriotism. Doesn\u2019t fool most voters.

Not that I want to bring back that kind of reporting / anchoring, but trump's antics are not funny in any way, no matter how absurd they are.

Any judge who says that he won't listen to a witness shouldn't be hearing that case.

No American citizen should be subjected to a political show-trial like this.",

Paid liars who hate the American people, hate American sovereignty, hate the American flag, hate the United States Constitution, hate the United States borders, hate the military, hate patriots, hate laws and law enforcement (look at crime in NY, where I live. Thank you Lettia James.), hate the middle class, hate the family, hate children, hate your right to freely express yourself, hate freedom, hate religion, hate virtue, hate character, and, perhaps most of all, hate Donald Trump. Pure, unmitigated, unadulterated hate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This is what the Communist/Marxist Left is all about-from top to bottom. Hate -- it's all they have and all they know. By the way, if you haven't figured it out yet, these elites--your betters--hate YOU. --A former Democrat",
    "They (those who are anti-Trump) use the same methods used in the former communist countries in the period before seizing all the power. They attacked those who opposed them in trials, later called political trials.\nThe strategy used was the following:\n1. They changed any law so that it could be interpreted in the sense they wanted.\n2. They appointed judges to play their game for them.\n3. The public prosecutor attacks the political opponent in court.\n4. What was said in court did not matter. The sentence was known before the trial began.\n5. The whole situation is happening on the taxpayer's money for the accusers and judges. On the defendant's money for him.\nThe goal pursued was to impoverish the defendant (who had expenses for the trial) and at the same time to \"form\" him a bad image in the eyes of the public. Their press \"called\" the defendant \"the enemy of the people\".\nThis situation was repeated as a pattern in all former communist countries. I didn't think this could happen in USA 2023.",

Is this in the best interest of our nation, to have someone who wanted military on his side instead of the American people? How can we trust in a person who took top secrets designed to protect us with unknown intentions?  Will the nation vote in a man who is clearly stating he will suspend OUR constitution? Will we vote in a wealthy man that denied paying his taxes when we had to? If that is the case, when his term ends, will it ever in fact, end?

I hope E Jean Carrol gets paid before the state takes it's share.\nTrump has been a scourge on NY for decades.  He build buildings without sprinklers.  He used mobsters to pour concrete.

They all feel they are losers - because of others. (ditto - Trump at trial)\nThey become hecklers, who cannot give a coherent talk, but disturb others who give coherent talks. Heckling requires no intelligence - just make a noise. Any noise, that disturbs the existing lecture ,orderliness going on. Trump is a heckler.\nTrumps whole life is equivalent to that of a heckler heckling Life-University lecturers. \nNo one comes for his lectures. He is not a lecturer - he is a heckler. \nThose who come to him and become his pathetic and deplorable flock come to be like him - to be hecklers of the orderliness of the Life-University.\r\n\n\nAnd so in his mass-meetings they are not listening to his lecture as he is NOT a lecturer with coherence. They swarm mindlessly to heckle along with him. \nMy friends in USA will have to understand this. His meetings are Heckling-Orgies. There is no purpose but the momentary pleasure the heckler gets that he is one-up on those he bad-mouths and disturbs and intimidates. Its a ridiculously simple minded shouting party - blaming others for one's own loser-status in one's own eyes.\nThe curse on hecklers is that, to be hecklers they must be internally disorderly - and messed up in their own coherent thinking.  Ever heard anything consistent and coherent from MAGA cult members? Ever heard anything but name-calling (heckling) from MAGA cultists? See how the hecklers finally heckle each other? That is how the nemesis of heckling works - heckling based lives, institutions, teams, parties, cults, nations, civilizations implode as hecklers heckle each other into mutually-assured-destruction as they turn from their original ENEMY - the relatively orderly world.

Reducing their viewership, taking away precisely that which they sought by this behavior is the correct punishment for the people of America and the only way to keep Fox from repeating the behavior perhaps a little more subtly, a little more \"dog-whistly.\".  \n\nI understand that it was Dominion who brought a civil suit, not the DOJ bringing a criminal lawsuit.  I am just saying that this will reduce Fox's cash in the bank by 20%, which, unless they lose viewership, they will quickly recoup.  They will not lose viewers because they will never tell their viewers, \"We intentionally lied to you to tell you what you wanted to hear, which was NOT the truth, in order to keep you from changing the channel.\"\n\nThis network now has about half the subscribers of Fox News.  When those numbers are reversed we will be able to conclude that this settlement made a real difference, not before.",

    "it is my opinion that the recent settlement reached between Dominion and Fox News is significant not only for the amount of the settlement, but for what it represents in the ongoing debate surrounding the accuracy and integrity of the US election system.\n\nWhile defamation cases are not uncommon, the size of the settlement in this case is unprecedented and suggests that Dominion had a strong case against Fox News. It is important to note that while media outlets have a right to report on events and express opinions, they also have a responsibility to ensure that their reporting is fair and accurate. The settlement serves as a reminder to media outlets that they must exercise caution and care when reporting on sensitive topics such as elections.\n\nAdditionally, the settlement highlights the importance of protecting one's reputation, particularly in a highly politicized and divisive environment. While it is unfortunate that Dominion had to resort to legal action to protect their reputation, the settlement sends a message to others that defamation will not be tolerated, and that legal action can be taken to hold those responsible accountable for the damages they cause.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the settlement does not necessarily indicate guilt or wrongdoing on the part of Fox News. It is possible that the settlement was reached to avoid the cost and uncertainty of further litigation, and may not necessarily reflect the merits of Dominion's case.\n\nOverall, the settlement serves as an important reminder of the legal and ethical responsibilities of media outlets, and the potential consequences of defamation. It is my hope that this case will encourage media outlets to exercise greater caution and care in their reporting, and to prioritize accuracy and impartiality above sensationalism and political bias.",
    "What about us, the people who Fox lied to? Dominion is not the sole victim.

If anyone has a brain, they would see how this is harassment and the charges are always weak and flip flopping all over the place without any evidence being brought to the public! This isn\u2019t a fair justice system because the standards are different for the right and left! Once again, you guys don\u2019t know when to stop and because you insist to keep forcing these issues, Trump just becomes more popular and rises to the top. Dems never learn.",

It's the bank responsibility to determine property values, the word is \"Appraisal\" no loan goes thru without one........",

This job market is full of part time jobs nobody wants which is why that border is wide open. All this while record numbers of people have stopped looking for work.

The only solution will be when most of the people who are still buying high priced goods they cannot afford come to their senses and stop buying things like the rest of us who cannot afford anything. That is when we will have a recession. I will still vote for Biden but only because I do not want Trump in office again.",

They\u2019re idiotic and dumb because they have a great immigration bill that President Biden give to gave to them and everyone in President Biden\u2018s cabinet is operating on the authority that was already given to them by Congress if they want more authority to act on, they need it by Congress President Biden even said himself that he is a president he\u2019s not a dictator and he\u2019s only going to act on the authority that Congress gives him, and within his powers, according to the constitution so the evidence is true and I believe this is going to backfire with the Republicans in November mark my words in November this is going to backfire on Republicans and the Republican parties going to see that crazy magma ideas is not worth it anymore and I\u2019ll go back to how was being conservative willing to be partisan with the Democratic colleagues in Congress and so forth but until then we\u2019re gonna keep seeing this until November, and I know the people gonna go out and vote and show up and tell the world that yeah we\u2019re staying for Democratic policies were setting up for being for being free. We\u2019re standing up to have a voice filled and heard that be supported government that is firm, but fair that is, you know great to help with the economy, and great to help when people are in need in our country And our allies",

They can only repeat GOP talking points that weirdly, only come whenever there is a Democrat President!!",

Why are so many people unable to afford basic necessities, and inflation is out of control? \nThe border is not a real issue, and it is just a 'shiny object' to distract from the amazing economy? that's funny, I swore that the illegal immigrants were costing $450B annually, and the federal government is giving free phones and flights and shelter to illegals when we have destitute citizens...",
    "Yes, both sides were partisan when viewing how the economy was going to go under Biden, but it should be noted that one side was right and the other was not. Because one side bases their opinion on reality (historically the economy does better under Democrats) and the other side bases their opinion on partisanship only.",

Nobody understands what democrats are explaining , it\u2019s not being seen or felt in the real world . That\u2019s why this doesn\u2019t work .

    "Another reason republicans will never give credit to a democrat-because a lot of them live in red states that are run by republican politicians. They do things like opt out of federal programs designed to help people, they fight culture wars instead of instigating policy. So of course their lives aren\u2019t better  in Mississippi even with a democrat in the White House. The difference is, EVERYONE\u2019S life is worse under a republican president\u2026\nAs for getting people to worry about immigration-democrats need to hammer home with voters that they had a bill and Republicans didn\u2019t want to support it because they don\u2019t want Joe Biden to get a win. Play those clips, use those quotes. Fight for one elections cycle for Pete\u2019s sake",
    "That's the issue, the economy is doing great because corporations are inflating prices, so while everything is at its highest, so are costs of products and benefits. If we are the best economy in the world, we shouldn't have such a wage gap, so many homeless (especially vets), and so much in medical costs"
