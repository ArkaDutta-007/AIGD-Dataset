No one is saying what happened on oct 7th wasn\u2019t a horrific attack by a terrorist militant faction of Hamas. But the same cruelty is also being perpetrated against innocent civilians of Gaza daily for the last 8 months. There are sadly similarities in the racism and hatred both sides have for each other and the history and treatment of Palestinian people goes back a lot further than October 7th. The pressure cooker has been boiling for a long time with no holds or stops by any country. \n\nIf I was American this and the exit from Afghanistan would loose my faith in Biden. BUT come November I would also have to think would I even from another country think trump should ever have power again and the answer is 100% no. So while I emphatically disagree with this statement and its points - bear in mind in November - the alternative could end democracy, roll back even more laws about women\u2019s reproductive rights or lgbtq+, lift any restrictions on guns at all, give tax breaks and slide the profits to the richest, make friends with dictators and refuse to give up power is a REAL thing. So absolutley question and push Biden and hold to task on these issues but a trump 2025 would be civil war or the end of USA at worst so even a democrat not Biden on the ballot could be like voting for trump as would not voting. \n\nI really wish Biden would show as much care for the kids and civilians of Gaza as he does Netanyahu. \ud83d\udc94",

Considering what the US and its allies have done in other countries, they might have done worse in Ukraine if they were in the situation they placed Russia in.\nI strongly recommend conducting your own independent research and findings.

I hardly think any aspect of Donald Trump's experience with the criminal justice system remotely compares to the experiences of ordinary Americans.

The only thing that matters more to him is his own position as speaker, he could care less about any of the so-called financial issues, because let's be honest, if he cared about that he would know, in fact he does know, that all of that money is actually staying in the USA... We buy new stuff to put in our warehouses, as we give our junk to Ukraine, and that is what that bill pays for. And it's worse than that, it would cost us more to demilitarize or to scrap this junk, like the 1000 ATACMS that we are about to decommission, then it would for us to just give it to Ukraine. Same goes for most of those Bradley's... In other words it cost us more to get rid of it by scrapping or demilitarizing, then it does to ship it and give it to Ukraine",

    "Fact check: Anyone who reads history and the Bible knows that 3,000 years ago, Israel was created after the Israelites settled in Canaanite land. They were commanded by God to kill all other tribes, especially the Canaanites, and take their land, which God called the \u201cPromised Land.\u201d It wasn\u2019t theirs to begin with.\n\nFast forward to the 1900s, for over 700 years, Arabic-speaking people were living in Palestine, with the Jewish population being around 5% before WWI. Then Zionists and England artificially migrated Jews back to that land, planning \u201cethnic balancing.\u201d Jews do not have any right to reclaim that land as Israel. If there is no statute of limitations, the entire Middle East would belong to Persia, and Iran could reclaim all those countries back. Native Americans should reclaim America back, and many other examples exist worldwide.\n\nThe creation of Israel in 1948 was and is illegitimate. Jews needed to make peace with the indigenous people. If Arabs didn\u2019t want to make peace with immigrants, it was their right, as it was their home for many generations.\n\nFact: Justice is only written in books. In reality, it is jungle law; the stronger and smarter wins. Israel won and continued conquering land and will crush anyone who goes against them. Israel has committed ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and genocide.\n\nFact: Anti-Zionism does not mean anti-Semitism.

It should, considering that the United States had four years of this from it's own wannabe dictator and propaganda networks.\n\nThis blind cult like support for Israel is akin to the blind cult like support that MAGA has for Donald Trump. This election season the Republican Party WILL try to align Trump and Christian nationalism. If Trump wins the Presidency, the atrocities that you are showing in this reporting will be happening with no accountability or even any criticism from the United States government. The Republican Party is literally bragging about it before it has happened. ...I would like to see one of the GOP members who made those kinds of statements questioned about what they see in this video.\n\nThere needs to be a discussion about Netanyahu having ZERO reason to listen to Biden and the United States, considering the fact that if Donald Trump becomes POTUS Bibi gets whatever he wants. The more these atrocities happen, the worse Biden looks and the more likely it is to affect the 2024 US election results in favor of Trump. The question needs to be asked if whether or not Netanyahu is actively working against Joe Biden's on the world stage in hopes of negatively affecting Biden's reelection chances in November.\n\nThe news media needs to hold Netanyahu's radicalized wing of the government and the IDF accountable for war crimes. Part of a genocide is cultural and religious cleansing of the area, NOT just the killing of the targeted people. Joe Biden needs to strongly and confidently condemn this act and absolutely demand that Netanyahu get control over his forces; demand rein in the terror on civilians; and show Netanyahu that the President of the United States is NOT a puppet to try and manipulate NOR is the United States, a country on which Netanyahu specifically is politically dependent, an ally to be ignored and dismissed. Do NOT ask, and do NOT look down at the microphone this time. Condemn this behavior outright.\n\nJoe Biden and his administration are far more popular in Israel than Netanyahu. I think it's about time the Biden administration start pushing an online presence in Israeli social media platforms, building his following and supporters, and force Netanyahu out of office by creating pressure above (POTUS and US), below (Israeli citizens), and around (Israeli government)Bibi. Israel is a US ally; Bibi is out for himself. The Biden administration needs to recognize as well as accept this fact, and and respond accordingly.",

    "Popular Chinese outlets have been suggesting that events in Texas have led to deep divisions in the US widening to a point where unrest has become a stark reality.\r\n\r\nAs part of his Operation Lone Star, Mr Abbott has sought to block or deter entry into his state, including by installing about 30 miles (48km) of razor wire barriers along the city of Eagle Pass.\r\n\r\nTrending social media posts in China allege Mr Abbott was preparing to go to war with US federal authorities.\r\n\r\nHowever, many posts are still to be found on the popular platform, which has more than 600 million monthly active users.\r\n\r\nUsers are circulating pictures of the Texas Military Department flying a picture of a flag above its headquarters with the words \"Come and Take It\", which have led to domestic perceptions the state is stoking independence.\r\n\r\nOld videos from Fox News are also circulating of vigilante groups dressed in camouflage to \"defend the border\". There are also multiple videos being circulated from Chile of military tanks that are being misattributed to Texas.\r\n\r\nAs censorship makes it difficult for Chinese users to do their own fact checks, this has given many Weibo users the impression that the state is at war.\r\n\r\nSome have suggested that Texas could see a similar situation to Ukraine - which is at war with Russia - noting the two regions have a similar land mass.\r\n\r\nMedia messaging has made the idea of civil war more believable, as Chinese state media have regularly suggested that political divisions in the US are now so polarised that the country has reached the brink of internal conflict.\r\n\r\nWhile foreign media is largely blocked in China, content from foreign media is often cherry-picked to stoke suggestions of US internal divisions.\r\n\r\nSocial media users in China on Friday, for example, were able to read reports that Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis is sending up to 1,000 members of the National Guard to Texas.\r\n\r\nChina often publishes such reports as a response to Western governments issuing critical comments on China's handling of issues in Xinjiang, Hong Kong or Taiwan. It's a way of saying: focus on your own backyard, instead of telling us how to run our country.\r\n\r\nThis is not exclusive to the US. It is also common to see newspapers amplify suggestions that Scotland is increasingly pushing for self-rule, when UK politicians are critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese government maintains it does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs. \"This has always been a principle in our foreign policy and is recognised by the international community,\" it said in a recent statement.",

    "In All honesty, the Democratic Party can be their own worst enemy. Diversity in thoughts and opinions is a beautiful concept, but failing to rally, fully support, and fall in line is a significant area for improvement. To the credit of the Republican Party, they know how to hold the fort down and support their leadership, both rank and file. For example, if Former President Donald Trump had passed out during the debate, there would have been no one in the Republican Party asking him to step down because they recognized he was their strongest candidate. On the other hand, in the Democratic Party, there is a lot of noise about their elected candidate, President Joe Biden. Yes, President Biden had an awful debate for whatever reason, but calling for him to step down is highly unwarranted and unwise. In examining potential Democratic Party front runners, who are qualified to replace him? I keep hearing talks about Governors Gavin Newsome (CA) and Gretchen Whitmore (MI), but they need national recognition or experience. They may be prevalent in their home states but have yet to be tested nationally. Given the stakes of this election, it is unlikely they will be a force against Former President Trump.\nAdditionally, media outlets like CNN say House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would be a good choice again. He does not have the experience or national recognition and is still getting his footing in his current leadership role. Lastly, there are news media outlets (not the people) pushing for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the presidential candidate. Still, I strongly dissent, given her record and historically low approval ratings. Vice President Harris has not been able to accomplish anything noteworthy since being in office. Sidebar: I understand Vice Presidents are like spears until something happens to a sitting President. However, she was given tasks like managing and co-coordinating immigration issues at the U.S. Southern Border and has fumbled. Given the Republican Party takes most of the blame for their failure to pass the bi-partisan immigration reform bill (at the behest of Donald Trump). As a Black/African American, it pains me to say that Kamala Harris also faces significant challenges as a mixed-race person. We recognize that racism is alive and well in the United States, including the Democratic Party, as well. Along with being a person of color, she is a woman running for office in a highly contested election; given the historic precedence with women like Shirley Chislom and Hilary Clinton, we are in a more divisive and radical climate. Let\u2019s stick by President Biden he is the face of the presidency but there is an entire administration along side him doing to the work of the American people. We have protections in place and he follows the rule of law and listens to the advisors and established professionals including military leadership. We have not never heard him arguing, disagreeing and trying to undermine our institutions like Former President Donald Trump.",

    "Okay, if you want the inside scoop here's the details.  I know Luke and live and work on the side of the mountain he was on.\n\nLuke is Albino and has limited vision, can see clearly only a few feet in front of him.\n\nHe was probably trying to hike the old pipeline from Boulder Creek to Brookdale, which burned in the CZU fire, and the trail along it is no more.\n\nThat stretch of woods is extremely steep, check a topo map.\n\nIt is also pretty treacherous since the fire, I maintain a section of it for work, believe it or not but the fallen tan oaks, firs, redwood limbs, overgrown ceanothus and scotch broom make for a tough \"hike\".\n\nI've been stalked by a mountain lion twice that I was aware of, in that exact watershed, both times it left a huge fresh pile of scat on the trail.  I don't think it was trying to eat me either time, more trying to mark it's territory, probably had a den nearby. Mountain Lions don't regularly eat people, they have evolved to be wary of humans.  Unless you get caught between a mom and her cubs or trigger their hunting instincts because you are running or stooped over, they are most likely to observe you from a distance, which sounds like what Luke described.  \n\nMost likely Luke was chillin doing his thing, whatever that was, then after a few days realized he was in over his head.  He DID try walking out, but for him that meant walking uphill to get to Empire Grade, some people on Braemoor at the top heard him calling for help, but like I said that stretch of woods, after the burn, is actually pretty gnarly and steep, so combined with him being legally blind, and the old trails gone from the fire, it sounds like he fell down a ravine at one point and hurt his ankle so it's not hard to believe he got stuck at some point.\n\nThe water he was drinking is essentially spring fed creek water from a steep uninhabited section of watershed, unless there was a dead animal upstream most likely the flowing water he drank was pretty clean.  In fact, it is the same water most of the town drinks, albeit before filtration and chlorination.\n\nYes, he could have just kept going downhill to get to the hwy, but these hills are extremely steep and overgrown, it truly isn't as easy as it seems.\n\nFor anyone who says you can just walk to the ocean or San Jose in a day, you've obviously never been on THIS hillside, just look at a top map, after a major fire, overgrown and full of downed trees, it wasn't like he was on the Skyline to Sea or other popular maintained trail \n\nAlso, he wasn't in Big Basin State Park at all, he was on SLV watershed property, which is not maintained like a state park.\n\nIn conclusion, we were starting to worry about him after a week of him being missing, he wasn't doing this for \"attention\", his family is glad he was found, and really this story didn't need to be national news.",

Ihan Omar's comment was, at a minimum, a dog whistle to known anti-Semitic people like David Duke who immediately responded to her comment and said \u201cI agree with Ilhan Omar about Israel!\u201d Even the Ayatollah of Iran praised her for the comment.

    "Of course it's related to religion - Christianity is a doomsday death cult [*]. Founded on human sacrifice, sanctified in cannibalistic ritual, and fervently praying for the immediate end of the world. We put these people on watch lists, but Christianity gets grandfathered because they tortured and murdered anyone that disagreed until they got a stranglehold on the zeitgeist. The Bible is a horridly immoral book about a horridly immoral god. And the foundational Christian concept of vicarious redemption (scapegoating - via human sacrifice, for crissake!!) is completely immoral; as is eternal torture for thought crimes. And a smattering of plagiarized pious precepts don't erase, excuse, or make up for the heinous content that pervades. \n\n[*]...  and devout male Jews, to this day, say a misogynistic prayer every morning before they get out of bed thanking their god for not making them a woman .. And Islam is basically an Arabicized version of Nestorian Christianity - nearly all the things we abhor about the Muslim faith, religious war, misogyny, etc,  is taken from the Bible - (The Quran is positively packed with Bible references - The New Testament says women should 'go covered, and be silent').\n\nWe call someone a \"good Christian\" (or Muslim, Jew, etc ..) in direct proportion to the degree in which they ignore the bulk of what their immoral scriptures say. We should laugh derisively - do a spit-take - every time someone claims to believe \"Jesus is His own Daddy and He lives in the sky'.\n\nI'm not alone in my opinion ...\n\n\"Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise\" ... \u201cWhat influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people.\u201d - James Madison\n\n\u201cHistory, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government.

    "Source: Wikipedia\n\n'Sabra and Shatila massacre'\n\nIn June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon with the intention of rooting out the PLO. By 30 August 1982, under the supervision of the Multinational Force, the PLO withdrew from Lebanon following weeks of battles in West Beirut and shortly before the massacre took place. Various forces\u2014Israeli, Lebanese Forces and possibly also the South Lebanon Army (SLA)\u2014were in the vicinity of Sabra and Shatila at the time of the slaughter, taking advantage of the fact that the Multinational Force had removed barracks and mines that had encircled Beirut's predominantly Muslim neighborhoods and kept the Israelis at bay during the Beirut siege.[7] The Israeli advance over West Beirut in the wake of the PLO withdrawal, which enabled the Lebanese Forces raid, was in violation of the ceasefire agreement between the various forces.[8]\n\nThe killings are widely believed to have taken place under the command of Lebanese politician Elie Hobeika, whose family and fianc\u00e9e had been murdered by Palestinian militants and left-wing Lebanese militias during the Damour massacre in 1976, itself a response to the Karantina massacre of Palestinians and Lebanese Shias at the hands of Christian militias.[9][10][11][12] In total, between 300 and 400 militiamen were involved in the massacre, including some from the South Lebanon Army.[13] As the massacre unfolded, the IDF received reports of atrocities being committed, but did not take any action to stop it.[14] Furthermore, Israeli troops were stationed at the exits of the area to prevent the camp's residents from leaving and, at the request of the Lebanese Forces,[15] fired flares to illuminate Sabra and Shatila through the night during the massacre.[16][17]\n\nIn February 1983, an independent commission chaired by assistant to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Irish diplomat, Se\u00e1n MacBride concluded that the IDF, as the then occupying power over Sabra and Shatila, bore responsibility for the militia's massacre.[18] The commission also stated that the massacre was a form of genocide.[19] And in February 1983, the Israeli Kahan Commission found that Israeli military personnel had failed to take serious steps to stop the killings despite being aware of the militia's actions, and deemed that the IDF was indirectly responsible for the events, and forced erstwhile Israeli defense minister Ariel Sharon to resign from his position \"for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge\" during the massacre.\n---\nOn 17 September, while Sabra and Shatila still were sealed off, a few independent observers managed to enter. Among them were a Norwegian journalist and diplomat Gunnar Flakstad, who observed Phalangists during their cleanup operations, removing dead bodies from destroyed houses in the Shatila camp.[68]\n\nMany of the bodies found had been severely mutilated. Young men had been castrated, some were scalped, and some had the Christian cross carved into their bodies.[69]\n\nJanet Lee Stevens, an American journalist, later wrote to her husband, Dr. Franklin Lamb, \"I saw dead women in their houses with their skirts up to their waists and their legs spread apart; dozens of young men shot after being lined up against an alley wall; children with their throats slit, a pregnant woman with her stomach chopped open, her eyes still wide open, her blackened face silently screaming in horror; countless babies and toddlers who had been stabbed or ripped apart and who had been thrown into garbage piles.\"[70]",

The third and final sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katid Johnson, took place after Plaintiff Johnson had been brutally and savagely raped by Defendant Trump. While receiving another full body massage from Plaintiff Johnson, while in the nude, Defendant Epstein became so enraged after finding out that Defendant Trump had been the one to take Plaintift Johnson's virginity, that Defendant Epstein also violently raped Plaintiff Johnson.\nAfter forcing Plaintift Johnson to disrobe into her bea and panties, while receiving a massage from the Plaintiff, Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff johnson's anal cavity with his erect penis while trying to restrain ber. Plaintiff Johnson attempted to push Defendant Epstein away, at which time Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson's vagina with his erect penis.\nThis attempt to brutally sodomize and rape Plaintiff Johnson by Defendant Epstein was finally repelled by Plaintiff Johnson but not before Defendant Epstein was able to achieve scxual orgam.\nAfter perversely sodomizing and raping the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, the Defendant, Jeffrey E.\nEpstein, attempted to strike her about the head with his closed flists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff Johnson that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who \"took her cherry, not Mr. Trump\", before she finally managed to break anay from Defendant Epstein.\n17.

    "Corrections: \n1. It\u2019s not important which government is in Israel. The war is Gaza would\u2019ve happened anyway and with exact same power because of the terror attacks on October 7th. And Israeli citizens would support this war against extreme religious fanatics in any situation. \n2. The protesters are there not because they are outraged, they are there because they are being fooled and manipulated by organized hate machine, sponsored by Qatar, Turkey and other states in conflict with Israel. Qatar poured billions into US universities, promoting its ideology and hatred of Israel. Qatar are also the main sponsors of Hamas and Hamas leadership live in Qatar. So the protesters are ignorant fools, a useful idiots. \n3. There are not many innocent civilians in Gaza. Almost every apartment and every house in Gaza had weapons stashed under beds, many had entrance to the terror tunnels, posters of Hamas, and etc. All kids in Gaza go to local schools and start their day with a prayer that curses Jews and says that every Jew must be killed. That\u2019s propaganda and brain washing from very early age. \nNo wonder that almost every family or tribe in Gaza has someone in Hamas. Hamas is the governing body, they organize summer camps in which kids train with weapons how to infiltrate Israel and kill Jews. Look it up on Google, there are multiple videos showing 6-7 year old kids in uniform training to be terrorists. Hamas are religious fanatics that want to destroy Israel and kill or expel all Jews, so they can establish religious caliphate based on Sharia laws from Koran. \nThey get weapons from Iran, smuggled through Africa and through tunnels in Egypt. \n4. There is no starvation in Gaza, they have a lot of food and provisions. It\u2019s all panic of the wealthy Americans. Oh no, people in Gaza don\u2019t have huge supermarkets with tons of cheap food, they must be starving then. FFS, they live very well, don\u2019t worry. See videos how they spend time at beach in Gaza just few weeks ago, that\u2019s not what starved people do. They have a lot of food. \n5. All the destruction in Gaza is because Hamas built terror tunnels everywhere with weapons and rockets inside. And they shot these rockets into Israeli cities. This is why all these houses are destroyed, because they had entries to tunnels or because they were fighting spots for terrorists. \nAnd most of the houses are not destroyed, it\u2019s not as bad as you see it on news, that show only selective stuff. \n6. Bernie, stop talking about things you don\u2019t understand. Palestine don\u2019t want peace with Israel, they don\u2019t want two states, they have 80% support of Hamas in West Bank. So clearly they are not interested in any offers that Israeli may suggest. They want to keep attacking, they want a constant war and constant victimhood. This is how they get money from the entire world. Why would they stop if this is how they earn money and get sympathies. The only way they stop is if there are no Jews left. And it\u2019s not my opinion, almost all Palestinians say it openly. It\u2019s easy to find. They want to suffer and be victims for some fanatical ideology, well, they get what they ask for. \n\nIsrael is defending itself by killing terrorists, and there are a lot of them in Gaza. Out of 30k+ killed, at least 20k are Hamas militants, because IDF has similar numbers for killed terrorists. But overall numbers are based only on information passed from Hamas, there is no independent source to confirm it. These numbers are greatly exaggerated.",

    "Former President Donald Trump was dealt two major setbacks Thursday in his efforts to derail the criminal cases against him, with judges in the Georgia election interference case and in the federal classified documents case both rejecting bids by the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee to have those cases thrown out.\r\n\r\nThe judges in both cases have yet to decide other requests put forward by Trump seeking the dismissal of the Georgia and federal prosecutions, which were brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and special counsel Jack Smith, respectively. But for now, the prospect of the cases eventually going before juries remains alive, and a trial in a third criminal prosecution against Trump \u2013 the 2016 campaign hush money case brought in New York \u2013 is on track to start this month.\n\nThe New York case aside, the likelihood that the other prosecutions against Trump \u2013 which also include a federal election subversion case brought in Washington, DC, by the special counsel \u2013 will go to trial before the November election is very much still in the air. Delay has been a key part of the former president\u2019s strategy, and he has had considerable success in prolonging the pretrial litigation in the prosecutions against him. The DC case, which at one point was moving the most quickly among all the Trump criminal cases, is now on hold while the Supreme Court considers whether Trump\u2019s status as a former president grants him immunity from those criminal charges. Those arguments are scheduled for this month.\r\n\r\nTrump has made similar presidential immunity arguments in the Georgia case and in the classified documents case. He has pleaded not guilty in all four criminal cases.\r\n\r\nIn the classified documents case, which is proceeding in south Florida, US District Judge Aileen Cannon on Thursday declined Trump\u2019s request that she dismiss the case based on his arguments that he had the authority to take classified or sensitive documents with him after he left the White House.\r\n\r\nCannon\u2019s short order, however, kept open the possibility that Trump could still use the argument to defend himself at trial or could bring it up in other pre-trial proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe judge, a Trump appointee, didn\u2019t detail her views on the claims Trump was making, based on a law called the Presidential Records Act, but said Trump\u2019s attorneys did not meet the legal standard to dismiss charges.\r\n\r\nShe wrote that prosecutors \u201cmake no reference to the Presidential Records Act\u201d in the indictment against Trump and did not \u201crely\u201d on the statute to bring charges.\r\n\r\nCannon also used the order to push back on a request by the special counsel she make a final ruling on whether the theory could be incorporated into the jury instructions of an eventual trial, so that prosecutors could appeal such a ruling to the 11th Circuit. She said that \u201cdemand\u201d was \u201cunprecedented and unjust.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are still more than a dozen outstanding motions for Cannon to decide, including several other motions to dismiss the case.",

As in the past, T felt he had to redominate attention from all the K H coverage, Paris, anything not him.  So, he found some raw meat inanity for the media to chew on.

HELL, he did not associate with people who look like him that were not considered elitist.

It seems like this type of kinetic operation by the IDF accomplishes a military goal and results in no civilian casualties. They had an order to kill on sight and they carried out the mission.

But what is really going on here. But why is Israel acting like the Nazis? The Israeli philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz introduced the term \"Judeo-Nazis.\" He argued that continued military occupation of the Palestinian territories would lead to the moral degradation of Israeli Defense Force (IDF), with individuals committing atrocities for state security interests. In 1988, Holocaust survivor Yehuda Elkana warned that the tendency in Israel to see all potential threats as existential and all opponents as Nazis would lead to Nazi-like behavior by Jews. During the First Intifada, historian Omer Bartov was enraged by Yitzhak Rabin's call to \"break the bones\" of Palestinians and wrote him a letter arguing that, based on Bartov's research, the IDF could be similarly brutalized as the German Army was during World War II.[One Israeli nationalist told Amos Oz that he did not care if Israel was called a Judeo-Nazi state, it was \"better [to be] a living Judeo-Nazi than a dead saint.\" In 2018, Noam Chomsky cited Leibowitz, arguing that he was right in his prediction that the occupation was producing Judeo-Nazis.",

So if you stay behind don\u2019t take the mark stay in faith to Jesus and resist cause they will chop your head off, let it happen if captured. For this time will be hell on earth. Lucifer will force you to take it. Do not accept it choose death. i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word.

While I understand that you would like to win again I wonder if a younger man would show such weakness in the face of Putin's murderous bombing of sick children, women and infrastructure in Ukraine. Is there a quota of dead kids you are waiting for? How many dead Ukrainians do you need on that spread sheet before you will give Ukraine the planes and missiles they need to protect themselves? I think a younger man would have the guts to back Ukraine to win. So which are you? Chamberlain or Petain? Churchill or FDR you are not. Your weakness makes our country weak. Why should I vote for a man who does not stand up to Putin's terrorism? Your appeasement costs thousands of lives. I am ashamed of our flawed foreign policy.",

    "Georgia\u00a0prosecutor\u00a0Fani Willis\u00a0filed criminal charges against former\u00a0President Donald Trump,\u00a0for his alleged attempt to overturn the results of the\u00a02020 presidential election, on August 14, 2023.\nShe ran, campaigned and fundraised on a platform of prosecuting President Trump on bogus indictments. Republicans are saying that this is an effort to interfere with the 2024 presidential race and damage the dominant Trump campaign where he is leading in Republican primary polls by a wide margin.\nThe former president and his allies have accused Willis and others of engaging in \u201celection interference\u201d intended to thwart his 2024 White House campaign. This is nothing more than a dangerous effort by the ruling Democrat party to suppress the choice of the people.\u00a0\nHowever her case seems to be falling apart because it is alleged that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis engaged in an improper relationship with \nNathan Wade, an attorney in private practice who she brought on board as a Special Prosecutor in the prosecution of Donald Trump in November 2021.\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis acknowledges her romantic relationship with\u00a0special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\nWillis has said publicly that she is \u201cflawed\u201d and \u201cimperfect\u201d in her public\u00a0remarks\u00a0at Bethel AME Church following the allegations. Both Ms Willis and Mr Wade acknowledged the relationship started in early February 2022. \nHowever Willis\u2019s former friend and employee, Robin Yeartie, claims the district attorney's relationship with Mr Wade began before he joined the Trump case contradicting both of their timelines. She saw the pair hugging and kissing years before the case, Ms Yeartie told the court, so she had \"no doubt\" the relationship started in 2019.\nThis relationship has ultimately created a fatal and irreparable defect in Trumps indictment and a conflict of interest that has tainted the entire prosecution. Furthermore, Wade was not properly installed as a special prosecutor because the county did not authorize the hire and his oath was not filed, supposedly rendering the indictment moot.\u00a0\nRecords have shown that Ms Willis overpaid Mr Wade for the special counsel role and that the two took luxury holidays together that were paid for by Mr Wade. Those trips included two cruises to the Bahamas, and trips to Napa Valley, California, and Caribbean resorts in Aruba and Belize.\nThis gives rise to the optics that the prosecution \u2013 and the prosecutor \u2013 are motivated by politics, not law. The practical implication is that the public, including those that voted her into office, will question her judgment in the handling of this case.\nMr Trump's lawyers allege that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired, prove a conflict of interest.\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee has held an evidentiary hearing that include extremely personal details of the private lives of Willis, Wade and others.\nThe hearings mark the first time a judge will officially determine if allegations surrounding an affair between Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and the private attorney she\u00a0hired to oversee the case, Nathan Wade, are enough to disqualify one or both of them \u2013 and potentially even to dismiss the case altogether after three years of investigation and prosecution. To this point, Georgia Supreme Court decision,\u00a0McLoughlin v. Payne, provides useful precedent. In that case the court found that a district attorney should have been disqualified for acquiring \u201ca personal interest or stake in the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d\nWillis, Wade, and the entire district attorney's office could be removed from the case. Both Willis and Wade should rightfully be disqualified.",

    "Tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century. The ensuing police crackdowns echoed actions decades ago against a much larger protest movement protesting the Vietnam War.\n\nIn the Mideast, Iranian state television carried live images of the police action, as did Qatar\u2019s pan-Arab Al Jazeera satellite network. Live images of Los Angeles also played across Israeli television networks, as well.\n\nPolice methodically ripped apart the encampment\u2019s barricade of plywood, pallets, metal fences and trash dumpsters and made an opening toward dozens of tents of demonstrators. Officers also began to pull down canopies and tents. The number of protesters appeared to diminish through the morning as some voluntarily left with their hands up and police detained others.\n\nThe law enforcement presence and continued warnings contrasted with the scene Tuesday night, when counterdemonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing traffic cones, releasing pepper spray and tearing down barriers. Fighting continued for several hours before police stepped in, though no arrests were made. At least 15 protesters suffered injuries, and the tepid response by authorities drew criticism from political leaders as well as Muslim students and advocacy groups.\r\n\r\nBy Wednesday afternoon, a small city sprang up inside the reenforced encampment, full of hundreds of people and tents on the quad. Demonstrators rebuilt the makeshift barriers around their tents while state and campus police watched.\r\n\r\nSome protesters said Muslim prayers as the sun set over the campus, while others chanted \u201cwe\u2019re not leaving\u201d or passed out goggles and surgical masks. They wore helmets and headscarves, and discussed the best ways to handle pepper spray or tear gas as someone sang over a megaphone.\r\n\r\nOutside the encampment, a crowd of students, alumni and neighbors gathered on campus steps, joining in pro-Palestinian chants. A group of students holding signs and wearing T-shirts in support of Israel and Jewish people demonstrated nearby.\r\n\r\nThe crowd grew as the night wore on as more and more officers poured onto campus.\r\n\r\nRay Wiliani, who lives nearby, said he came to UCLA on Wednesday evening to support the pro-Palestinian demonstrators.\n\nMeanwhile, protest encampments elsewhere were cleared by the police, resulting in arrests, or were closed up voluntarily at schools across the U.S. In New York, those included the City College of New York, Fordham University, Stony Brook University and the University of Buffalo. Others nationwide included Portland State in Oregon, the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and Tulane University in New Orleans.\n\nPolice burst into a building occupied by war protesters at Columbia University on Tuesday night, breaking up a demonstration that had paralyzed the school.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Wisconsin in Madison, a scrum broke out early Wednesday after police with shields removed all but one tent and shoved protesters. Four officers were injured. Four people were charged with battering law enforcement.\r\n\r\nIn rare instances, university officials and protest leaders struck agreements to restrict the disruption to campus life and upcoming commencement ceremonies. At Brown University in Rhode Island, administrators agreed to consider a vote to divest from Israel in October \u2014 apparently the first U.S. college to agree to such a demand.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Press tallied at least 38 times since April 18 where arrests were made at campus protests across the U.S. More than 1,600 people have been arrested at 30 schools.\n\nThe nationwide campus demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 to protest Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, which followed Hamas launching a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there.\r\n\r\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests antisemitic, while Israel\u2019s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.",

    "That last point is really important and should be discussed more deeply with additional experts (e.g., public health experts, social scientists). Young men are falling behind, because the social/cultural restrictions placed on them have been slower to abate, compared to the social/cultural restrictions placed on women. And those restrictions are primarily being held in place by other men, powerful men. \n\nSo, instead of pointing out the scientific evidence on why young men are falling behind and some potential changes we could make to allow boys/men to be full human beings, this person giving a commencement speech would revert to the more oppressive restrictions placed on everyone -- even those who do not share those particular religious beliefs -- and only allowing the few to rule over all. This person and the world view he describes tells everyone to \"stay in their lane\" while never really addressing who exactly gets to decide what those lanes are and who gets assigned what. It probably is supposed to be God, but according to him there are so many posers and cowards among Christians (including clergy) who may or may not be appointed by God and we shouldn't analyze holy texts and history on our own.

    "I feel like there is some context missing and I am having trouble finding the original interview.\r\nThere are several red flags that what he's being mocked about is out of context.\r\n1. He says he could have done it, acknowledging that she should be locked up and he knows it.\r\n2. He says he feels differently about it. Why would he feel different about something he says he denies ever saying?\r\n3. There are cuts in places where context should be. It adds suspicion that they are trying to manipulate the interview for his worst outcome. \r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that though he said \"I didn't say lock her up\", there is more to the story than this. \r\n\r\nAlso, it's funny that democrats seem to fly over the amount of racist and lies Joe Biden said during the 2020 election and yet Trump makes one oopsie and they take that as far as they can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReply",

    "When you do the math, it becomes clear that the democratic party has to do everything in their power to replace Biden.\u00a0\n\n\n1.\u00a0 There is a large group of people that would vote for anyone over Trump. Their dislike of Trump is so intense, that they would vote for a man with onset dementia over Trump.\u00a0\n\n\nAll of those people would vote for a replacement candidate.\u00a0\n\n\nMy best guess is that number is around 1/3 of voters.\u00a0 I got that number from the polls which said that about 1/3 of people think Biden won the debate, despite having a bad day in terms of his dementia (which will become more frequent)\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a02.\u00a0 How does the democratic party get more votes?\n\n\n- Convince people that Biden doesn't have dementia\n\n\n- Convince more people that we should put a man with dementia in the white house over Trump.\u00a0 And remember that statistics show that his dementia will get progressively worse in the next year or 2.\u00a0\n\n\n- Put up another candidate.\n\n\nThe choice couldn't be more obvious.\n\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n\n1.\u00a0 I hear a lot of people in the democratic party saying that replacing a candidate this late in the process has never produced good results, historically.\u00a0\n\n\n2. \u00a0 Statistics become more predictive as the sample size increases.\u00a0 There are\u00a0 very few examples of situations where a candidate was replaced this late in the process.\u00a0 With a low sample size, statistics\u00a0 carry very little meaning.\u00a0\n\n\n3. \u00a0 For statistics to be useful, there needs to be uniformity.\u00a0 Not only are the situations extremely different but the times are extremely different.\n\n\n4. \u00a0 When there is an absence of quality statistics, the next best option is to logically think through a problem, as I did above.",

    "6,709 cultural assets were looted from six museums during the Korean War. If you combine the North and South, about 33,000 pieces of Korean cultural property were looted.\n\nThere were many cultural assets destroyed during the operation. According to a report in 'Modern Buddhism' in 2001, 180 temples were completely or partially burned during the Korean War. The Jogye Order claimed that two-thirds of them were damaged by our troops. In particular, 73 temples were damaged in Jeolla-do, and it is said that they were burned during the operation to suppress partisans in Jiri Mountain.\n\nAmong these were national treasure-level cultural assets. At Gwaneumsa Temple in Gokseong, Jeollanam-do, Wontongjeon, National Treasure No. 273, and the gilt bronze seated Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, National Treasure No. 214, were destroyed by arson by our forces. At Songgwangsa Temple in Suncheon, Baekwoondang and Cheongwoondang, National Treasure No. 404, and Daeungjeon, National Treasure No. 240 at Jangheung Borimsa Temple, were destroyed by friendly forces. The destruction of cultural assets in the process of subjugating partisans cannot be said to be an inevitable damage during battle. Considering the firepower of the partisans at the time, this cannot help but be seen as a more active and systematic destruction of cultural properties than was necessary.\n\nIn 2010, cultural critic Hwang Gyu-ho's paper titled 'History of the plunder of cultural properties by imperialist powers' claimed that cultural properties looted during the Korean War were recorded in a U.S. State Department document called the 'Adelia Hall Records'. If the looting of cultural properties by the U.S. military was merely a \u2018personal aberration,\u2019 there would be no list of cultural properties in the State Department documents. Systematic looting by U.S. troops is also suspected. Of course, the United States did not create a dedicated unit and systematically plunder cultural assets like the Nazis did. However, as Dr. Donny George pointed out, it is clear that the US military did not protect cultural assets from destruction and looting. Additionally, although it is unclear whether it is personal deviation or systematic corruption, it is clear that a significant portion of the looted cultural assets have flowed to the United States. The activities of the \u2018Monument Men\u2019 are a beautiful story, but it was only to protect their cultural assets. America's attitude toward other people's cultural assets was completely different. This dual attitude of the United States makes the aftertaste of <Monuments Man> even more bitter.",

    "At 5:13, Mister Scaramucci said that Trump isn't a racist; I would like to note just a few facts and/or reports made by some former Trump associates:\nHere are just a few things to consider or perhaps remember:\r\n(a) When Trump was serving as the president of his family\u2019s real estate company, the Trump Management Corporation, in 1973, the Justice Department sued the company for alleged racial discrimination against black people looking to rent apartments in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.\r\n\r\n(b) \"When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,\u201d said Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump\u2019s Castle.\r\n\r\n(c) Trump disparaged his black casino employees as \u201clazy\u201d in vividly bigoted terms, according to a 1991 book by John O\u2019Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.\r\n\r\n(d) \u201cI think the guy is lazy,\u201d Trump said of a black employee, according to O\u2019Donnell. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It\u2019s not anything they can control.\u201d\r\n\r\n(e) Long before calling Mexican immigrants \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists,\u201d Trump was a leading proponent of \u201cbirtherism,\u201d the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and is thus an illegitimate president.\r\n\r\n(f) When citizens were protesting the murder of George Floyd, Trump wanted to have the U.S. military shoot them, and had to be held in check by members of his cabinet!\nMaybe he isn't a racist, but in my opinion, he certainly acts as if he is!",
    "Marco Rubio is going to be the VP pick. He has to be. Never mind all of the \"little Marco\" back-&-forth. Those creases will be smoothed-over as handily as a softball sitdown interview with the two of them on Fox and/or Newsmax. MAGAlandia is very forgiving - provided that you are licking The Tangerine Candidate's boots. Rubio is very ambitious and sees this as his chance, at long last. (And, yes, he will relocate with his family to the D.C. area to avoid any constitutional conundrum.) He wants to use this as an ideal pad to launch the campaign for 2028. Team Trump's cynical calculus is that Latino voters will vote Trump simply to have a fellow-Latino/Cuban/Hispanic in the White House in the number-two slot, salivating over the race for 2028, to finally, again at long last, elect a Spanish-speaking person as President (living the long-cherished dream of 'The Brown House,' as Right-wing functionaries deride such a nightmare.) Team Trump realizes it will not be able to secure the Black vote in any meaningful way that can sway the election, so they are turning to Latino voters, believing they will pry off enough of them to swing it. This is their cynical calculation. Remember that the electoral map is a straight numbers game. 5,000 votes here, 10,000 votes there . . . . Latinos en masse will not be voting for Trump even with \"little Marco\" as Number Two, yet if just enough of them become so orgasmic over the prospect of a Spanish-speaking VP, who may eventually \"P,\" as Team Trump imagines it, that they fill in the oval for Don The Con, it may weight it for the orange column. They imagine Rubio canvassing, state-by-state, campaigning in Spanish, inspiring a frenzy of pro-Trumpism (whatever that means. ) Besides, aren't all Latinos deeply Catholic, impenetrably so? They don't care about losing reproductive care rights, RIGHT? This is the thinking in the braintrust of Trumplandia right now. It's gong to be Marco Rubio - Bank on it.",

    "Manhattan prosecutors are asking the judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s criminal case involving hush money payments to impose a gag order to stop the former president from publicly disparaging potential witnesses and others involved in the trial.\r\n\r\nThe gag order request was one of many pretrial motions filed by the district attorney\u2019s office and Trump ahead of the trial, including requests to play the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording of Trump and to bar testimony from his former lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nProsecutors are not asking the judge to block Trump from speaking about District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\r\n\r\nThey are seeking state Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan to gag Trump from making comments about potential witnesses, lawyers involved in the case other than the DA, court staff, and family members of lawyers and staff. In addition, prosecutors also asked the judge to prevent Trump from making public statements about any prospective juror in the trial.\n\nThe gag order motion was one of several filed publicly on Monday. Prosecutors also asked the judge to restrict Trump from knowing the addresses of jurors. They are not asking for an anonymous jury.\n\nYet another jury in New York might consider the widely reported Access Hollywood Tape in which Trump can be heard making vulgar comments about his treatment of women to show host Billy Bush.\r\n\r\nThe DA\u2019s office also asked Merchan to exclude Trump defense arguments that he\u2019s being selectively prosecuted by Bragg and Trump\u2019s claims that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) dismissed administrative complaints against Trump in connection to these allegations.\r\n\r\nAccording to the DA\u2019s pretrial motion, the FEC dismissed the complaints without investigating because the agency faced an extensive enforcement backlog and Cohen had already been punished in his federal criminal case, which included a guilty plea related his role in this alleged scheme.\r\n\r\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argued in his motion that the alleged payments to Daniels and Karen McDougal could not be considered Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) violations because they were not campaign contributions and were not made with the purpose of influencing the election.\r\n\r\nBragg\u2019s office wants to block a potential defense witness who would testify about federal campaign finance law. Prosecutors say testimony from Trump\u2019s witness, whom he\u2019s paying $1,200 per hour, is irrelevant to Trump\u2019s alleged intent to defraud and would confuse and mislead the jury. The prosecution\u2019s motion argues Trump\u2019s witness can\u2019t testify because expert witnesses aren\u2019t permitted to testify about legal conclusions at trial.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution also wants to bar Trump\u2019s legal team from arguing several threads common in his frequent public attacks on the DA\u2019s office and this case, including his claims that the US Department of Justice declined to prosecute Trump in connection to these allegations. Trump was president and so immune from prosecution in 2018 when Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money scheme. They also don\u2019t want the jury to hear about former assistant district attorney\u2019s Mark Pomerantz\u2019s book that discusses this case and has served as frequent fodder for Trump\u2019s defense.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers want the judge to bar any testimony from Cohen, who is at the crux of the prosecution\u2019s case. The defense filing lists Cohen\u2019s run-ins with the truth in court proceedings and congressional hearings since his falling out with Trump after the election.\n\n\r\nThe prosecution \u2013 which intends to call Cohen to testify about his pivotal role in the alleged hush money scheme \u2013 wants to limit cross-examination from Trump\u2019s lawyers about Cohen\u2019s credibility, specifically asking Merchan to exclude any evidence from Cohen\u2019s interactions with federal prosecutors that address his lying or false statements he made to federal agencies, their motion says.\n\nThreats against Bragg and the office\u2019s staff went from nearly nonexistent in 2022 to a volume that the district attorney\u2019s security detail could no longer assess on their own, causing them to bring in additional assistance from the New York Police Department\u2019s Threat Assessment & Protection Unit.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, the first year Bragg was district attorney, one out of 483 threats picked up by the NYPD\u2019s Threat Assessment & Protection Unit involved threats to the district attorney, his family, or employees, according to an affidavit from Nicholas Pistilli, commanding officer of the security detail for Bragg and a sergeant in the NYPD.\r\n\r\nThe following year, when a grand jury was hearing witness testimony and ultimately indicted Trump, 89 of 577 threats picked up by TAPU were made against Bragg, the office, or his family, Pistilli said.\r\n\r\nBy March 20, 2023, when there were daily news reports about the investigation and grand jury, \u201cthe volume of threatening, harassing, or offensive calls and emails increased significantly, exceeding the capacity of the DA Office\u2019s investigators and NYPD detective detailed to the DA office\u201d and the work was then shifted to TAPU for assessment.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys are also trying to block prosecutors from using two of Trump\u2019s longtime associates against him \u2013 former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Allen Weisselberg and Rudy Giuliani, who has served as Trump\u2019s personal attorney in recent years.\r\n\r\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argue prosecutors should not be allowed to use handwritten notes Weisselberg took during a January 2017 meeting with Cohen. Weisselberg was involved in the hush money payment and subsequent reimbursement to Cohen, which began soon after the meeting. Trump\u2019s lawyers say the notes shouldn\u2019t be allowed in without Weisselberg\u2019s testimony and argued that he is not on the district attorney\u2019s witness list.",

    "The Biden administration moved Tuesday to reclassify mariju\ufeffana as a lower-risk substance, a person familiar with the plans told CNN, a historic move that acknowledges the medical benefits of the long-criminalized drug and carries broad implications for cannabis-related research and the industry at large.\r\n\r\nThe US Department of Justice recommended that marijuana be rescheduled as a Schedule III controlled substance, a classification shared by prescription drugs such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine.\n\nFor more than 50 years, marijuana has been categorized as a Schedule I substance \u2014 drugs like heroin, bath salts and ecstasy that are considered to have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse \u2014 and subject to the strictest of restrictions.\n\nLast fall, members of the FDA\u2019s Controlled Substance Staff wrote in the documents that the agency recommended rescheduling marijuana because it meets three criteria: a lower potential for abuse than other substances on Schedules I and II; a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the US; and a risk of low or moderate physical dependence in people who abuse it. The National Institute on Drug Abuse concurred with the recommendation.\r\n\r\nAlthough marijuana has a \u201chigh prevalence of non-medical use\u201d in the US, it doesn\u2019t seem to elicit serious outcomes, compared with drugs such as heroin, oxycodone and cocaine, the researchers said. \u201cThis is especially notable given the availability\u201d of products that contain very high levels of Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary active compound in cannabis.\n\nCurrently, 24 states, two territories and DC have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use, and 38 states allow medical use of cannabis products, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. State-licensed cannabis dispensaries and retail shops are expected to generate $32.1 billion in sales this year, according to estimates from MJBiz, a cannabis industry trade publication and events organizer.\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment has ballooned: In November, a record 70% of Americans surveyed by Gallup said they supported cannabis legalization. In 2014, that share was 51%.\r\n\r\nUS lawmakers have warmed up to the plant as well, drafting scores of cannabis-related bills, including those seeking to remove marijuana entirely from the Controlled Substances Act while preserving the state-run markets.\n\nMoving marijuana out of Schedule I could open more avenues for research; ease some of the more harshly punitive criminal consequences; potentially allow cannabis businesses to bank more freely and openly; and, perhaps most significantly for state-licensed operators, result in firms no longer being subjected to a 40-year-old tax code that disallows credits and deductions from income generated by sales of Schedule I and II substances.\r\n\r\nHowever, rescheduling marijuana will not solve that federal-state conflict, the Congressional Research Service noted in a January 16 brief. The manufacture, distribution and possession of recreational marijuana would remain illegal under federal law and possibly subject to enforcement and prosecution regardless of the state\u2019s legality, the CRS wrote.\r\n\r\n\u201cOutside of the tax implications, this is monumentally symbolic,\u201d Andrew Freedman, the former Colorado cannabis czar who now serves as executive director of the Coalition for Cannabis Policy, Education and Regulation, told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt is rare for the federal government to reverse itself on an issue where it\u2019s had a stance for the last 100 years and arrested countless people for.\u201d\r\n\r\nStates with medical marijuana programs do currently have some federal protections in place via appropriations legislation that restricts the Justice Department from interfering in those programs. Schedule III status will not affect that rider, the CRS said.",

    "Black people in New York know Donald Trump, the citizen, not candidate pitching for the Black vote, who tried to make their lives as miserable as possible. Donald Trump had a system in apartment rental applications where he instructed his staff to write the letter 'C' for Colored when Black people applied. He was sued and fined by the Housing Authority for discrimination. Donald Trump doesn't like hiring Black people at his properties, however managers hired the best qualified people, who were often Black. However, those Black people had to disappear when Donald Trump would come to inspect the properties so that Trump would not see them. Trump's employees know Donald Trump is a racist who gives the appearance that he's not for the sake of public promotion or in this case, for his political campaign. What I don't understand is why any Black person supports him when they know he's just wearing a mask that he will remove once he gets in office and will sides with White Supremacist groups?

    "brothers Otto & Gregor Strasser did much to grow the party by tying Hitler\u2019s racist nationalism to socialist rhetoric that appealed to the suffering lower middle classes. In doing so, the Strassers also succeeded in expanding the Nazi reach beyond its traditional Bavarian base. By the late 1920s, however, with the German economy in free fall, Hitler had enlisted support from wealthy industrialists who sought to pursue avowedly anti-socialist policies. Otto Strasser soon recognized that the Nazis were neither a party of socialists nor a party of workers, and in 1930 he broke away to form the anti-capitalist Schwarze Front (Black Front). Gregor remained the head of the left wing of the Nazi Party, but the lot for the ideological soul of the party had been cast.\n\nHitler allied himself with leaders of German conservative and nationalist movements, and in January 1933 German President Paul von Hindenburg appointed him chancellor. Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been born, and it was entirely fascist in character. Within two months Hitler achieved full dictatorial power through the Enabling Act. In April 1933 communists, socialists, democrats, and Jews were purged from the German civil service, and trade unions were outlawed the following month. That July Hitler banned all political parties other than his own, and prominent members of the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps. Lest there be any remaining questions about the political character of the Nazi revolution, Hitler ordered the murder of Gregor Strasser, an act that was carried out on June 30, 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives. Any remaining traces of socialist thought in the Nazi Party had been extinguished.\n\nTrump idolizes Dictators like Hitler, Kim Jong-un and Putin a man who murdered women and children in Schools and in Hospitals Trump even has a copy of Mein Kamph on his nightstand according to his ex-wife who He felt needed to be buried on His golf course for a tax dodge loophole matter of fact I still wonder if she was cremated then why did take ten men to lift Her casket must be some documents hidden in that casket that Trump didn't want people knowing about or getting to why were the folders empty and why did he invite the Saudi's at a golf tournament or why did Jared Kushner receive 2 billion from the Saudi's; Nazi's didn't just stop with persecution of Jews they also came after LGBTQ, Jehovah's witnesses, Disabled, Elderly, Gypsies, Muslims, & those who they deemed lower or less inferior to themselves.",

    "Voting near his residence in Palm Beach on Tuesday, Trump contended he didn\u2019t have any knowledge of Manafort\u2019s potential role at his Milwaukee nominating convention, but he added: \u201cHe was another person who was treated badly and he was a patriot but we\u2019ll see what happens with that.\u201d The Washington Post first reported the discussions to get Manafort involved.\r\n\r\nManafort, a lobbyist who became chairman of Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign, was one of the highest-profile arrests in special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He was convicted in 2018 of defrauding banks and the government, and of failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars in income he had earned from Ukrainian political consulting. He later faced additional punishment for obstruction of justice.\r\n\r\nOriginally sentenced to 7.5 years in prison in 2019, Manafort was granted home confinement in April 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. In December, a month after losing reelection, Trump pardoned Manafort.\r\n\r\nTrump issued 237 acts of clemency during his four-year term \u2013 the majority coming after the 2020 election, including 143 during his last hours in office. Though Trump issued fewer pardons than many of his modern predecessors, when he did, he largely operated outside the Office of the Pardon Attorney, a nonpartisan agency inside the Department of Justice that assess requests for executive clemency. The lack of protocols often led petitioners and their supporters to lobby Trump directly or make their case to his son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief of staff Mark Meadows or the White House counsel.\r\n\r\nPast presidents have certainly flexed their considerable clemency authority to benefit political allies and not without controversy. President Gerald Ford famously pardoned Richard Nixon a month after his predecessor resigned in disgrace. President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of Scooter Libby, the former chief of staff to his vice president Dick Cheney convicted of obstructing a federal investigation. President Bill Clinton issued a pardon for Marc Rich, who fled the country to avoid facing charges for tax evasion. Rich\u2019s ex-wife was a donor to Clinton\u2019s presidential library.\r\n\r\nBut even against that history, Trump\u2019s pardons stood out, Crouch said.\r\n\r\nIn the final months of his presidency, after losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, Trump frequently told his aides that he had planned to be liberal with his pardons and asked friends and loyalists who they thought he should pardon, multiple sources familiar with the conversations told CNN at the time. Trump, at the time, delighted in his ability to issue sweeping pardons \u2013 and viewed it as an opportunity to further build goodwill with those who had been loyal to him throughout his time in office.\r\n\r\nOther stalwart Trump allies beside Manafort to receive a pardon included: veteran Republican operative Roger Stone, who was also indicted by Mueller and convicted of multiple crimes; Bannon, who had pleaded not guilty to charges he defrauded donors in a \u201cWe Build the Wall\u201d online fundraising campaign; and Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser charged with lying to the FBI.\r\n\r\nWithout Trump\u2019s intervention, it\u2019s possible all four could have spent the 2024 election cycle serving federal punishments. Stone in 2020 was sentenced to three years in prison and two years of supervised release. Trump pardoned Bannon before he went to trial, but his three co-defendants last year received prison sentences ranging from three to five years. Flynn pleaded guilty but was never sentenced and faced a maximum of five years in prison.\r\n\r\nInstead, they\u2019re now key players in the effort to reelect Trump, emerging as some of his most ardent defenders to their sizable audiences. Stone remains an outspoken supporter of his longtime friend, trafficking in unsavory rumors about Trump\u2019s political opponents on social media and hosting a radio show on a conservative New York station that debuted with a Trump appearance. He is also a regular at Mar-a-Lago and walked out with Trump\u2019s campaign staff on Super Tuesday for the former president\u2019s victory speech.\r\n\r\nBannon\u2019s War Room podcast serves as a clarion call to Trump supporters to mobilize around the 2024 election by regularly spreading misinformation about the last one. Flynn has toured the country in recent years, appearing at rallies where he, too, shares election conspiracies. Calling into one of the events last year, Trump told Flynn: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring you back.\u201d\r\n\r\nDinesh D\u2019Souza, one of Trump\u2019s earlier pardons, has championed the former president\u2019s causes as well through his own podcast and other media ventures. Most notably, D\u2019Souza \u2013 who in 2014 pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions \u2013 created \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d a misleadingly edited and conspiratorial film about the 2020 election that has animated Trump\u2019s opposition to voting by mail. Trump hosted a screening of the film at Mar-a-Lago in 2022.\r\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a former contestant of Trump\u2019s Celebrity Apprentice reality television show who was freed by the former president in early 2020. Blagojevich recently defended Trump\u2019s courtroom antics in an interview with Politico, calling the former president \u201cbrave\u201d while lauding his \u201cchutzpah.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany pardoned by Trump had long ago served their time and are now aiding Trump from the other side of their amnesty. Tate was convicted in 2014 along with two other senior leaders on Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign on charges stemming from a bribery plot to secure an Iowa state senator\u2019s endorsement. His sentence, issued in 2016, included six months of home confinement, two years of probation and community service.\r\n\r\nCNN reached out to Tate through an email address on the website of his consulting firm, but he did not respond.\r\n\r\nTrump also effectively cleared the name of Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law who in the mid-2000s served prison time after he pleaded guilty to 16 counts of tax evasion, one count of retaliating against a federal witness \u2013 his brother-in-law \u2013 and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission.\r\n\r\nLast June, Kushner gave $1 million to Make America Great Again, Inc., one of the largest single contributions to the pro-Trump super PAC so far. Meanwhile, Trump-pardoned New York real estate executive Alex Adjmi donated $100,000 to MAGA Inc., as did the son and daughter-in-law of Paul Pogue, a former construction executive from Texas included in Trump\u2019s last-minute pardons. Pogue and his wife also contributed $6,600 to a Trump-affiliated campaign committee.\r\n\r\nAlready, there is intrigue around the fate of another Trump ally, Peter Navarro. An ex-White House aide for Trump, Navarro recently reported to federal prison after he refused to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6 attack.\r\n\r\nTrump on Tuesday wouldn\u2019t say if he intends to pardon Navarro if he returns to the White House. But his praise for his former aide echoed words he used to describe Manafort.",

Cutting taxes for the rich and letting them rising sell prices in low income communities to increase their profits. Higher sells taxes for us and lower tax on them. Keep cutting taxes for the rich and history will repeat itself. An these so-called black men agree with this republican BS. This kinds of black people like to oppress poor to enrich the rich.

And God, they know they are risking the future of their own country by letting in millions of people to ruin our nation instead of just teaching them how to improve their own countries. ... They call it 'compassion' when in fact, it stems from their lust for perpetual power..\nAnd God... Since so many calling themselves 'Democrats' do not believe in you and they mock and reject you, They act out by turning to perversity and tell men it's alright to paint themselves and prance around naked or condemn little children to a lifetime of madness and misery by changing their sexes..\nThis is all rebellion against YOU, dear Lord. They don't like being told 'No' and they don't like being expected to promote peace and goodness or spread hope for the world.\nPlease bring them out of misery, dear God... The demons have seeped into their minds and hearts and confused their thinking... Please give them the courage to break the chains of the Devil and turn to You?... And please give those of us with the discernment to see what's happening the strength to forgive them and the will to go forward no matter how they seek to destroy us?... When we anger and feel helpless, please tighten your armor around us and hand us your words of valor as a shining sword to cheer us on... We need your army of angels, oh Lord... We need you to stand beside us in this war between Goodness and Evil.\nIn the mighty name of Jesus, I pray.",

    "I was raised a catholic, until\u2026I actually seriously started to read the Bible. We can read in Scriptures that Lord Jesus commanded the Apostles to first preach the Gospel to the Jews, and after also to the Heathen or Gentiles (but never vise versa ! ). I found out in Scriptures who of the Apostles for the first time went to Rome .. and it wasn't Peter. In the Book of Acts it says in Chapter 28 the following: 16 \"And when we came to Rome, the Centurion delivered the Prisoners to the Captain of the Guard: but Paul was allowed to live in a house, by himself, with a Roman Soldier that kept him. 17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the Chief of the there living Jews together: and when they came together, Paul said to them: \"Men and Brethren, though I have committed nothing against our people, our customs, or against our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans 18 who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of guild in me. 19 But when the Jews spoke against that verdict, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had made any accusations against my Nation. 20 For this Hope (the Gospel of Jesus Christ) therefore I have called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because for the Hope of Israel I am bound with these chains. 21 The Chief of the Jews said to Paul: \"We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the Brethren that came from there shewed or spoke any harm of you. 22 But we desire to hear of you what you think: for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere\". The Roman catholic church claims that it was Peter who went to Rome first to preach the Gospel there first and that it was Peter who founded the Church there. Question: who lies? God,... or the Roman catholic church ? And what about the Letter in the Bible from Paul to the Congregation of Galatians where it says this in Chapter 2? From verse 7 we read the following: 7 \"But on the contrary, when they saw that the Gospel of the Uncircumcision (Gentiles) was committed unto me, as the Gospel of the Circumcision (Jews) was unto Peter; 8 for He that gave Peter power effectively to the Apostleship of the circumcision (again: the Jews), the Same was Mighty in me toward the Gentiles. 9 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the Grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we (that are Paul and Barnabas) should go unto the Heathen, and they unto the Circumcision. Again dear catholics: who lies? God\u2019s Word, or the Roman catholic church? Bible, the book of Acts, Chapter 5, verse 29 : Then Peter and the other Apostles answered and said: \u201cWe ought to obey GOD - rather than man\u201d !! Since the Roman catholic 'church' claims to be well-read on scriptures, then please point me in the direction of where in the Bible it says to pray to a woman, or with a rosary praising Mary, or to dead \u201csaints.\u201d Lord Jesus calls every believer Saints which all are who received the Holy Spirit and confess that Jesus is Lord \u2013 so Rome has no authority appointing only some people saint \u2013 that is ludicrous. Please show me the name \u2018pope\u2019 in the Bible? Please show me where it says to call any mortal sinful man (the pope) your father. Please show me where the Bible says anything about purgatory, or paying indulgences (buying yourself into heaven - is God corrupt ?). Please show me where Mary was sinless? Why is it that Catholics worship Mary still as a virgin when Lord Jesus had half brothers and half sisters? Please show me where it says to confess your sins to a fellow sinful man so that he may forgive them? Where does the Bible say the pope is the \u201cvicar of Christ\u201d on earth? Show me where it says that a preacher must be unmarried? It was the pagan ROMAN Emperor Constantine who was in fact the first \u201cpope\u201d who hijacked the first Christian Communion in Rome founded by the apostle Paul, and he didn't allow for the common people to have Bible Scriptures...to keep believers ignorant to stay in power, as the Catholic Church still tries to do. Later pope\u2019s started the \u2018inquisition\u2019 because the book printing machine was invented and people like Martin Luther and William Tyndale could spread the Bible to the common people: they were persecuted and many of them burned to dead for that by decree of Rome, and so were hundreds others who did the same as they denounced the FALSE doctrines of Rome. Rome called them heretics and witches while they murdered Christians who loved Jesus and true Scriptures. PLEASE GET OUT OF THIS FALSE CHURCH !!! The Roman catholic \u201cchurch\u201d is a continuation of the old Roman PAGAN Empire: it never went away as it disguised itself as a Christian Church. Read Revelation, Chapter 17: verse 7, 8 and 9\u2026Read also Revelation 18 to see what God will do to this \u201cchurch.\u201d",
    "The Lady makes a good point. The argument is taht Trump saw it as some summary legal expense because the person he was paying was his lawyer, except the evidence shows that trump knew it wasnt a legal expense, which was her point. Since Trump knew it wasnt a legal expense but booked it under legal expenses... that seems to be teh crime he's accused of. If Trump had booked it under some other kind of out of pocket or liquid cash or any other kind of \"slush\", fair game, but because he knew it wasnt a legal expense and told his book keepers and lawyers to treat it as such, he did commit the crime .... at least if that evidence holds.",

    "I would call Trump's defense of violating the gag order by simply retweeting things others have written, as the Sharpton Defense. If you remember decades ago, when a young black woman named Tawana Brawley caused a stir by claiming to have been abducted by white men, held and abused, with all sorts of people coming to her defense, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, in his overweigh, track suit days. It eventually came out that she had been lying all along. When Sharpton was called out after the truth came out, regarding his vocal defense of her, he responded with, \"I didn't say it [the things Brawley stated/claimed].  I just said what she said.\"\nBrilliant, tortured non-defense defense language. \"I didn't say it. I just said what she said.\" \nPeople forget how shameful Sharpton really was. I watch Morning Joe and have for a long time. Why Sharpton is now a beacon of black representation and spokesman hired by NBC News, is almost startling. It shows you just how low the bar is for occupying such a position. Is he supposed to be the voice of the average black person? Is it just that he's been in the media for so long? Is it that he has some unique personal insights (not that I've seen.)? A complete mystery why NBC News is having him be a part of its platform and offerings. Thankfully, though, NBC News does have a wonderful roster of black presenters and experts who have been hired for thoughtful and expert engagement on all subjects. Sharpton is just the odd man out, it seems.\nAnyhow, that's the Sharpton Defense, in my way of thinking.",

However, it is the ''Federal'' Election Commission, NOT the Manhattan DA, that is charged by Congress with enforcing ''federal'' campaign laws. \r\n\r\nBy taking ''federal'' law into his own hands, Bragg is way out of order! What\u2019s more, he has run afoul of a somewhat obscure but vital doctrine created by the Supreme Court specifically to prevent such prosecutorial overreach.\r\n\r\nThis rule, known as the \u201cprimary jurisdiction doctrine,\u201d says that a court should stay or dismiss a claim when it implicates issues within the special competence of a ''federal'' administrative agency. In this case, ''federal'' campaign finance violations are within the special competence of the FEC, NOT the Manhattan DA. Thus, the right thing to do is for Bragg to defer to the federal government on statutes it enforces.\r\n\r\nNew York statute requires that the predicate, the underlying crime, must also be a ''New York'' crime, not a crime in another jurisdiction. So by Bragg bringing a crime that ''allegedly'' was against the ''federal elections commissions'', he's dealing with a case ''outside'' of his jurisdiction!

    "Clown. Let's take what Bernie says here line by line, from about 0:27, \"... we don't want protests that are violent, and we ABSOLUTELY (he stresses that word) won't tolerate antisemitism,... (and now he lists his OTHER concerns) ... Islamaphobia, homophobia, or any other form of bigotry... \" Huh? Gee, Bernie. We didn't realize there were massive student \"protests\" all over campuses directing hate towards Islam or homosexuals. Where? As important as those things are, the issue right now is what has ACTUALLY been happening on these campuses. Let's continue... \nBernie, \"let's focus on why these protestors are out there.\" Yeah. That was my point exactly Bernie. Let's do that. Not conflate the issue as though he thinks there are massive Islamaphobic protests going on. Continuing... \nBernie, \"they are out there not because they are pro-Hamas.\" Yeah, sure Bernie. It's mixed. Pro-Palestinian protestors and outright pro-Hamas protestors. That's why we have seen Hamas head dress, swastikas painted in the halls at Columbia, signs calling for \"intifada,\" exactly what does he think, \"from the river (Jordan) to the sea (Meditteranean)\" means precisely? Doesn't exactly sound like calls for a two-state solution does it Bernie?  Continuing...\nBernie, \"they are out there because they are outraged by Israel's actions in Gaza.\" Yeah sure Bernie. That also explains why we saw such massive protests like when radical Islamists killed 70,000 Christians in Nigeria right? Maybe the protestors just missed that one in, \"we hate genocide 101\" class. Generally speaking, there is a lot of cross over on this, but the Democrat party seemed more in tune with supporting Ukraine. However, we didn't see massive protests on campuses regarding the atrocities in Mariupol, Kharkiv,.. imagine 9/11 if all of Manhattan was gone from the Twin Towers to Times Square. That's SEVERAL cities in Ukraine. Bodies lying on the streets in Bucha. Mass graves in Ukraine. Some people we learned were buried alive. 20,000 children kidnapped and trafficked to Russia. No campus protests. Not on THIS level. Why is that? You know the answer Bernie. Just say it... Continuing...\nBernie, \"Netanyahu's destruction of the Palestinian people.\" Bernie has chronically engaged this tactic. Sometimes (though not here I believe) using language like \"right-wing extremist\" government. Here is the real truth. The only difference between right and left at the moment in Israel is stuff like tax rates and the like. There is NO ONE, certainly not Bibi's more left political opponents in Israel, who isn't on board with destroying Hamas. Bernie loves to make it sound like, if only Bibi's \"right-wing extremist\" (geez) government wasn't in charge none of this in Gaza would be happening. WRONG... continuing... \nOH boy. Bernie talking about a two-state solution. Here we go again. To have a two-state solution you have to first have someone in Palestinian leadership to talk to. Like who Bernie? Hezbollah? the theocrats in Iran? Hamas? Hamas' very covenant calls for the destruction of Israel. Who is Israel supposed to be negotiating a two-state solution with Bernie? \nAmong numerous other things, we have all seen videos of Jewish students being blocked from getting to class. If this were whites trying to stop blacks from getting to class, it would look like 1964 U. of Alabama.  \n\nBernie is a basket case.",

    "\ud83d\ude80 Prioritizing Safety: Why SpaceX\u2019s Dragon Is Our Choice for Crew Return\r\n\"The safety of our astronauts is paramount. While the Starliner from Boeing has encountered issues, we believe that prioritizing crew security is non-negotiable. Even if the risk seems infinitesimal, we advocate for the most secure approach.\r\nGiven the current situation, utilizing SpaceX\u2019s Dragon for crew return appears to be the best solution. Once Boeing resolves the problems with the Starliner, it can be reintegrated into future missions. However, we caution against rushing this process. The public\u2019s trust hinges on successful outcomes, and any mishap during reentry could have severe consequences for both Boeing and NASA.\r\nIn the interest of continuity, we recommend thorough testing, analysis, and contingency planning. Only when we are confident in the Starliner\u2019s reliability should it be considered for operational crew rotation flights. And perhaps, at an opportune moment, we can proudly mention the name of The Space Empire, reinforcing our commitment to safety and progress.\"\r\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/.../nasa-again-delays-boeing.../\r\nhttps://www.livescience.com/.../astronauts-stranded-in...\r\nhttps://www.msn.com/.../boeing-starliner-s.../ar-BB1oBfk2",

    "Bernie says \"Israel has the right to go to war agains t Hamas; Israel does not have the right to go to war against the Palestinian people.\"\nWOW. I'm guessing America & the Allies did NOT have the right to go to war against the German people - just the Nazis. \nHow, exactly, does Bernie suggest Israel go to war against Hamas - the elected government of Gaza - WITHOUT going to war against Gaza?\n\nHamas committed an act of war against Israel. If you go to war with another country, you can't complain when they fight back. And hiding behind your own citizens - maneuvering your own women & children into the line of fire - is despicable.\n\nSpeaking of despicable: asserting that Israel should only be able to fight back against Hamas, should be unable to fight back against a state that has declared war in unmistakable fashion.\n\nDoes that seem unreasonable to Americans? Forget Bernie's twisted logic for 1 minute. Engage in a little history & a thought experiment. \n\nThe history: Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, killing 2,403 Americans. The US fought back, killing over 3 million Japanese & fire bombing every major city in Japan that wasn't reserved for nuclear strikes. Al Qaeda attacked NYC on 9/11, killing 2,996 Americans. The US responded by invading Iraq (wrongly, it turns out - Iraq wasn't involved), removing Saddam Hussein & his government, killing about 1 million Iraqis, leaving a failed state in civil war. That destabilized the entire region, contributed to the rise of Isis & descent of Syria into civil war, leaving Syria a failed state. Another 2 million died, and 9-10 million fled as refugees, stressing the Kurds, Turkey (which has ended up with over 1 million refugees to somehow feed & deal with), Jordan, Greece; produced a stream of refugees that has stressed Eastern European countries & encouraged the rise of nationalist right-wing parties across Europe.\n\nThought experiment: imagine for one moment that Mexico was led by a hard-right ultra-nationalist party. Imagine that government deciding it should respond to America's conquest of New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Nevada & California. Imagine that Mexico's government screamed \"From the River to the Sea\" - meaning it intended to kill every American - men, women & children - from the Rio Grande to the Pacific. Imagine that government then invaded the US - Texas, perhaps - and committed an outrageous massacre of men, women & children, brutally & horribly dismembering, beheading, raping & torturing then killing whole families. Killing a proportionate number of Americans to the whole population as were killed in Israel on October 7: killing 39,996 Americans (0.012%).\n\nSeriously: imagine that happening. \n\nIs there ANY conceivable universe in which the USA would NOT flatten Mexico in its effort to eradicate such a government of that country?\n\nWhile we're at it, is there ANY conceivable universe in which the US would tolerate - for 50 years! - a constant stream of missiles & rockets lobbed across its border? CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?\n\nSo climb off your high horse if you think Bernie Saunders is even marginally sane & reasonable. Israel has been attacked in an unmistakable act of war. Gaza instigated the war. If the Palestinian people don't like what their government has done, they should be revolting against it. They aren't.\n\nI understand how daunting that would be: they're starving; Hamas has all the guns and absolutely no compunctions about killing their own people. It's a horrible situation. And yet, by all accounts the majority of Gaza's people still support Hamas, and albeit after decades of indoctrination & teaching of hatred, Gaza's people overwhelmingly support Hamas' goal: to eradicate Israel & every last Israeli.\n\nWar isn't pretty. Bernie shouldn't be peddling ridiculous nonsense like this, claiming Israel must confine its fight to Hamas. That's an impossibility and he knows it. Israel can no more wage war against Hamas only, than the US could have waged war only against just those wearing a Nazi uniform.",

Because thats what Trump did and that is what he has obtained immunity from, despite overwhelming evidence, and guilty plea from a mostly republican jury.\n-Eliminate job protections for thousands of government-employees, extending to the private sector.\n-Deep cutbacks to Social security, Medicare and Medicaid, Disability, Unemployment and food stamps. In short forget about retirement or life saving medicines. Think about homelessness , if your savings isn't more than 2 million per retiree or 10 years of retirement, and your kids will be left with nothing BTW. \n- Increase fees on immigrants. Allow fast-tracked applications for migrants for money which will lead to a class of rich, corrupt and unqualified immigrants who will end up raising home prices further and eliminating american jobs and resources.\n-Slash federal money for research and investment in renewable energy. Thats global warming on steroids.\n-STOP SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. Get ready to join the war and send your children into war because it will come to your doorstep.\n-More support for oil and natural gas. Breathe more polluted air, drink more polluted water, eat more polluted food. Get ready to die from cancer on steroids.\n-Fire as many as 50,000 government workers to replace them with Trump loyalists. Nothing will ever get done in government ever, except if you bribe them.\n-Slash corporate and income taxes, which means everyone else will pay more, including your children swimming in debt, personal and national.\n-Abolish the Federal Reserve causing the dollar to crash and the economny to free fall, stock market to crash and more.\n-Return to gold-backed currency. Won't work. Never did.\n-Withdraw the abortion pill mifepristone and birth control pills. Very bad for women\u2026\n-Attack \"sexual orientation\", \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d, \u201cgender equality\u201d. All based on false Christianity and pure hate.\n-End \"abortion\" universally causing an increase in world population, resulting in mass famine and global world problems that will affect us negatively like even more illegal immigration and pollution on steroids.\n-End \u201creproductive rights\u201d for women. Women will not be able to work. They will die from pregnancy, childbirth and pure neglect.\n-Attack women's rights and equality. Women will be equated to slave status. No more freedom for women.",

    "I will delete this soon as I always do but I have to keep trying to show that people have to do TESHUVAH (REPENTANCE from ones evil heart/desires) to experience Messiah:  People won't do teshuvah till they DESIRE Messiah and this is the spirit of Elijah, the desire for Messiah which is also the TREE OF LIFE to those who receive this desire. \r\n\r\n Pro 13:12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.\r\n Pro 15:4 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.\r\n\r\nA wholesome tongue is able to prophesy to the dead bones of the whole house of Israel but this wholesome tongue is given by the RISING of Mashiach within you, the ANOINTING within you that inverts as the GOOD ROOT of the tree of knowledge to the CROWN of LIFE that releases the anointing at the place of the skull (KETER):   While this is Kabbalistic, the people of God need to grasp the spiritual meaning of Torah and the Bible now.  Time is short in grasping them but once Gods people begin to grasp the SPIRIT OF THE WORD, God will be IN THEM as the POWER they need to overcome all things. \r\n\r\nChristianity continues to deny Jesus and this leads to Messianic Judaism also going the way of BOTH Christianity and Judaism in denying him as well.   It is written anyone who does NOT CONFESS that Jesus Christ \"IS COME\" (present not past tens) in the flesh (their heart made flesh) is till of the spirit of Anti-Christ, the spirit of the whole world which is from the fall of Adam.  Satan has been the god of this world all these thousands of years but only those in whom CHRIST is revealed, perceive the separation of Anti-Christ from Christ in them, hence as Paul exclaims, separated unto the gospel.  Paul now had upper and lower members (above and below the mercy seat) and he ran the race where ONE (God in Christ) wins.   Paul was both in heaven (his rapture) and the tail of Satan, his lower members, his carnal mind, was still on earth being buffeted by Satan and these were his three woes, where he asked God three times to remove these messengers of Satan and God said, his Grace was sufficient because Paul like David/Judah before him, experienced Zechariah 12, where he had the VISION all people have and many had in the early Church where they too saw Jesus Christ crucified \"among\" (the heart) of themselves, Gal 3. NOBODY is in the NEW TESTAMENT till they experience Mark 4, John 16 and this is the fulfillment of Jeremiah 31, the CUTTING or circumcision of the heart of Dan 9, Mathew 24, to remove the abomination of desolation from the inner court, the Holy Place where that abomination should not be.  NOBODY in Judaism or Christianity or Messianic Judaism is teaching the truth yet because they don't grasp that the REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST is an individual event which is why the book of Revelation says only those who READ and UNDERSTAND this book are blessed. \r\n\r\n\r\nthe LAMB (ANOINTING) was slain from the foundation of the world when your name was written in the LAMBS book of life (your new name, not the one you got when you were born):  Israel had to get that BLOOD (anointing) on their door (Christ is the door out of the self) in order to escape Egypt (Ego, self, world):   The prophet in us must BEHOLD the LAMB that takes away the sin of the world you have to be baptized by water (not physical water) but the WATER OF THE WORD you need to be dunked in from the depth so your old man dies and your NEW MAN comes up and out of that water to be a witness (beheaded from the old man) of Jesus:  NOBODY is telling you any of this and just letting people THINK they \"know\" Jesus when he said \"many\" would come to him and he will say \"I never knew you\":   We become a ROYAL (King/David/Judah) and HOLY (Aaron/John the Baptist) priesthood when we repent, return to the GOOD ROOT (Christ) that Adam rejected. \r\n\r\nJesus is returning for 2000 years, from Acts 2 to now: Every man has his OWN DAY and HOUR for their visitation when that person repents (turns their heart which is Israel) around, back to God so Gods SEED can take hold in their good ground (Parable of parables Mark 4) So Jesus can be BORN through their heart (John 16) and because they repented, they become his mother, brother, sister (YHVH), the four letter name, the city four square, the four gospels, the four corners of the heart, EWNS, the four levels of LOVE (height, depth, width, breadth), and many (legion) have been experiencing Christ \"RISE\" in them (his saints, 2 Thess 1:10 ) to become LIVING STONES set upon the cornerstone that the builders prior rejected, as God BUILDS HIS FINAL TEMPLE with them.  Jer 31, it will not happen to all at once as it did the first time when God took them all out at once from Egypt but they didn't remain with him, but this time every man in his own order (I Cor 15) is made ALIVE IN CHRIST to become a member of his BODY, the LAST ADAM.  \r\n\r\nJesus said pray that your FLIGHT (rapture) is not in winter or the Sabbath day because things are going to get worse and worse:  Paul experienced his rapture but remained to run his race where \"ONE\" (God) wins.  Christ brings us all back to the UNITY of ONE God, and then he puts himself under the same God so that God can be all in and through all.  CHRISTIANITY is a religion and Judaism is a religion and religion (RE-LEGION) is to make the soul go through many exiles till it finds its REST (SABBATH) in God:\r\n\r\nWhy do I keep telling people this for 31 years since I had my day (second 1000th year) and hour (Jewish feast days of 1992)?  Because no one else is doing it and I feel bad that people aren't being told HOW CHRIST RETURNS to everyone even when they should know since it is written in so many ways in the Bible.  I put some videos up if you want to look at them. I often just take them down again because I realize how little I am able to be heard:  Jesus always qualified, IF YOU HAVE EARS and this is still true:  The five physical senses (carnal mind that is ENMITY with God) can not hear or understand the things of God:  Only the five spiritual senses (virgins with OIL, the ANOINTING) can see and hear the LORD and this is why Paul said, we can but SPEAK of what we have seen and heard:  Yet people speak of everything but what they see and hear because they are teaching from the carnal mind, the false prophet, the seed of the serpent, Babylon/confusion where Abraham and the Church too are elected.\r\n\r\n1Pe 5:13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so doth Marcus my son. \r\n\r\nBabylon (confusion) is the harlot or whore's forehead,  the carnal mind and during the visitation, we are admonished, COME OUT OF BABYLON my people, and this is still in the book of Revelation.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrist died with Adam from the foundation of the world (LAMB SLAIN FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD): How did he die? He was rejected (stone the builders (Adam and all mankind) is the stone Hashem will build the LIVING STONES (stony hearts circumcised) upon and build the house his way: You all will understand it one day:\r\n\r\n\r\nJesus Christ the SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY and forever is not a person but the ANOINTED HOLY ONE, ONLY SON, Yachida in Judaism that brings many sons to glory: You will all understand it one day:\r\n\r\nThrough this CHRIST or stone the COVENANT is cut in Dan 9 and this is the heart circumcision:\r\n\r\nDeu 10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. \r\n\r\nDeu 30:6 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. \r\n\r\nJer 4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev 19:26 explains, the WITNESS/TESTIOMONY (same word in Greek) of Jesus is the Spirit of PROPHCY and we know this is HOW God resurrects all the dead bones of the house of Israel from the valley of bones, every man in his own order (I Cor 15) in his saints (2 Thess 1:10 ) so everyone who sees Jesus (always in a vision (Acts 2) in the upper room (Place of the skull) is a witness and receives the power of life and death in their tongue to experience the resurrection from the dead, the ANOINTING that breaks the YOKE of the ego from the soul and gives the soul the heavenly YOKE (joined to Messiah). It stared with Abraham who saw Jesus day, and continues till the final member of the LAST ADAM is resurrected: BE READY always, you don't know your hour a head of time: Mine came in 1992, Jewish Feast days:",

An audit fight with the IRS could cost him another $100 million. At the same time, he reportedly paid taxes to foreign nations far larger than the $750 he paid in the United States the year he won the presidency and his first year in office\nFor a sitting president, with the power to impose fear or favor across the country and around the world, not to mention access to the nation\u2019s most closely held secrets, such financial exposure is more than embarrassing, former intelligence officials and ethics lawyers say: it makes Trump a national security threat.\n\u201cFor a person with access to U.S. classified information to be in massive financial debt is a counterintelligence risk because the debt-holder tends to have leverage over the person, and the leverage may be used to encourage actions, such as disclosure of information or influencing policy, that compromise U.S. national security,\u201d says David Kris, former head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division and founder of Culper Partners consulting firm.\ndue dates reported by the Times are accurate, \u201ca second term for Trump would result in increased vulnerability\u2014and thus, potentially, risk,\u201d says Robert Cardillo, former deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and ex-director of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

That's your whole argument Don't look at don't listen to your ears Don't let those lying eyes fool you just vote for f****** Joe because he's okay it's all right just don't pay any attention to what you just saw.

How the Palestinians Were Displaced in 1948 | The Village Under the Forest (2013)\r\nRemember 1948 Deir Yassin massacre = Palestinian Auschwitz committed by the survivors of the holocaust. Boycott apartheid genocidal Israel. Don\u2019t be the last to condemn the colonial apartheid state like you were in South Africa.\n\r\nThe Zionist apartheid colonial outpost is controlling ALL aspects of our lives. It is though NOT prepared for what the new generation is witnessing live on social media directly from occupied Palestine. Thanks to the social media and spread of information, Palestine is finally freeing us from this plague.\n \r\nNo state has a right to exist, but every person does. Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Rhodesia and countless others are states destined to fall and they did. This one is no different. Criticizing Israel is NOT anti-Semitic, the same way criticizing Saudi Arabia is not anti-Islam, criticizing Myanmar is not anti-Buddhism and criticizing India is not anti-Hinduism.\n\r\nDemolishing the apartheid state would be OK and in fact be the only way to save everybody including the Israelis. The two-state solution is no longer possible. Zionists stole ALL the land. The only solution left is ONE demilitarized secular state under international control with ALL people with documents showing ownership rights related to the land between the river and sea. We need to abolish all racial and religious favoritism. Refugees should be allowed to return if they so wish. We need to dismantle the apartheid colonial state. Peace will NEVER be realized without justice for all.\n\r\nThe answer is very clear and everybody should support it. One country from the river to the sea with the two peoples living together in a democratic system is the only solution. Such unitary binational state is advocated by several former Zionists and current historians including Miko Peled, Ilan Pappe, Gabor Mate, Norman Finkelstein, Barnaby Raine and others and supported by the majority of the Arab population of Palestine. The imperial colonial Zionist outpost is not working and it would NEVER work. \n\r\nAnd how many years can some people exist\r\nBefore they're allowed to be free?\r\nYes, and how many times can a man turn his head\r\nAnd pretend that he just doesn't see?\r\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\r\nThe answer is blowin' in the wind\r\nYes, and how many times must a man look up\r\nBefore he can see the sky?\r\nAnd how many ears must one man have\r\nBefore he can hear people cry?\r\nYes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows\r\nThat too many people have died?\r\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\r\nThe answer is blowin' in the wind\r\n\r\nAt the height of the extermination campaign conducted by Nazi Germany, they killed 127 children per day in Auschwitz. In Gaza genocide, the Zionist apartheid ethno-national state killed 139 children per day. See the difference for yourself. \r\n\r\n\"Land you have to kill for is not yours, but land you have to die for is\"\r\n\r\nThanks to social media and spread of information, with a couple of clicks and with courage and human decency, the truth shines for every seeker to recognize. Plan Dalet is a good way to start your search. It details the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian villages and towns from their inhabitants. Search Dier Yassin, Tantura, Ramla, Lydda, Safsaf, Sa\u2019sa, Kfar Qassim and hundreds of other massacres committed by Zionist Hagana, Irgun and Stern gangs in 1947-1948 under the eyes of the British authorities. \r\n\u201cGoliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel\u201d by Max Blumenthal.\r\n\u201cDenying people the right of return to their homeland, and at the same time offering this right to others who have no connection to the land, is a model of undemocratic practice.\u201d \u2013Israeli historian Pappe \r\n\u201cSince its establishment, Israel has engaged in brutal oppression of the rights of Palestinians. Thousands of Palestinians are imprisoned, beaten and tortured; children are taken from their beds and beaten by soldiers who are armed to the teeth.\u201d-Israeli historian Miko Peled.\r\n\"I am a freedom fighter- says teenager Ahed Tamini, the Rosa Parks of Palestine in her memoir \u201cThey called me a lioness, A Palestinian Girl\u2019s Fight for Freedom.\u201d This book is an eye-opener and a worthwhile read. \r\n\r\nPlan Dalet, the blueprint of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian villages and towns started in December 1947 and was FINALIZED by the High Command of the Zionist leadership on March 10, 1947. Not a SINGLE Arab army soldier had entered the Palestine/Israel before the Zionists declared the birth of their state on May 15, 1948. By then, more than 300000 defenseless civilians had already been massacred, expelled, raped, and mutilated and more than 300 villages and towns emptied, destroyed, torched, and imploded with dynamite under the watchful eyes of and with the support of the British soldiers and police, who left the country on the fateful day. The Zionists even ran out of dynamite because of the extent of their barbarity. By the end of that year, 20000 civilians had been killed and 750000-900000 defenseless civilians, 85% of the population who had lived in the land that became Israel, had been rendered refugees. 530 villages were destroyed and depopulated.\r\n\r\nZionists criminals even murdered the Swedish diplomat Count Folke Bernadotte, the UN peace envoy in Sept 1948 because he was a witness to their crimes. He objected to the Zionist plan of ethnically cleansing Palestine of its native inhabitants. He, by the way, as the head of the Swedish Red Cross, had helped in the release of about 20000-30000 inmates from the Nazi concentration camps in Germany during WW2.\r\n\r\nVideos and resources you might find educational: Warning, they may be difficult to get because of censorship.

Obama had nominated the woman/community organizer, for a position in his Administration (at the Dept of Agriculture, i believe), until Breitbart publicly attacked & smeared her name & professional reputation.\n\nDonald Trump has also used & abused racist dog whistles, tropes, and symbolism, by giving platforms to racist individuals, including re-tweeting the posts of known racists & organizations, and by holding rallies at locations & sites where race riots, beatings, and other violence has occurred (such as in Tulsa, and Jacksonville FL) and has even organized his rallies to correspond with the dates of those atrocities.",

They may have used criminal foreigners largely Ukrainians in partnership with anti-Putin or anti-establishment insiders to perpetrate the heinous crime. Conceivably the overarching intent of the USA pointing at  ISIS is first to distract and secondly drive a wedge between Muslims and Russians besides other obvious objectives. The shifting geopolitics and developing alliances and relations between Russia and Islamic nations have alarmed and scared the West. The criminal action's central purpose is likely aimed at poisoning the Russian population and inciting anti-Putin and Islamophobia sentiments in Russia to rescind Russia's increasing ties with the Muslim world. Who is this unclear ISIS that puts claim to terror attacks that occurred in Iran and Russia? ISIS is nothing more than an American proxy terror group with diverse geopolitical quests.

Many Islamic factions exist in the surrounding countries which used to form part of The USSR, those factions are now in Ukraine fighting in Ukraine on both sides, depending on the faction.

It is therefore reasonable to suggest that those captured (Foreign Russian Speakers rather than Arabs) were acting at the behest of factions within Ukraine. That seems highly plausible, the question is how much involvement did the Ukrainian Military have in organizing it and did the USA have any involvement, possible given they are still denying being involved in blowing up Nordstream and Nuland did promise Russia a few surprises. \nThere is also a long history of Ukraine attacks on their own civilians within the Russian speaking semi autonomous regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, (As confirmed by The UN, Amnesty and Human Rights Watch), 14000 killed since 2014.

Thus, during the upcoming weeks, the American people will be regaled with a torrent of leaks and innuendos about Biden\u2019s health issues.\n\nThe pressure to either force Biden to resign or renounce his candidacy is accelerating as the Democrats have become increasingly fearful of losing the presidency to their implacable foe, Donald Trump. \n\nBy foisting Joe Biden on America, the Democrat\u2019s \u201cbest and brightest\u201d granted a reprobate the ultimate upper hand in this election cycle: the threat to use the president\u2019s unlimited power to grant pre-emptive pardons to himself and whomever he chooses.\n\nWith the increasing probability of Donald Trump winning the presidency, the necessity of pre-emptive pardons increases exponentially as the specter of justifiable future retribution for the unleashing of egregious and unconstitutional lawfare against not only Trump, but average Americans, hangs heavily over the current occupants of the White House.\n\nIn what will be the most egregious travesty of justice in American history, Joe Biden, in order to protect himself and his family will inevitably issue numerous pre-emptive pardons during the waning months of his presidency. The most important of which will be a self-pardon.\n\nIn any event, while self-pardons are an issue that could end up before the Supreme Court, it would not prevent Joe Biden from pre-emptively pardoning himself for virtually everything as it would take years into his post-presidency to challenge and potentially reverse.\n\nThis power to pardon also serves as a potential extortion tool for an unscrupulous and devious cabal such as Biden, Inc. Based on their fifty-year history of financial manipulation, influence-peddling, and fraud, they would not hesitate to effectively blackmail the Democrat Party elites.\n\nIf the Democrat cabal insists that he drop out of the race but remain as president, the Bidens will demand a substantial quid pro quo in order to exit the campaign and defer issuing the pre-emptive pardons until after election day. However, he would maintain the upper hand by the mere implied threat of granting pardons anytime in the next four months before the election.",

As for the hostages, neither the left or the right or Holywood have even acknowledged them, and the 5 Americans still hostage 220 days into the war.

    "I agreed with most of what he said I also understand the outrage though. My mom is a stay at home mom and homeschooled my brother and I and I wish that more women  and men understood the value they bring in relationships but sadly not many realize it. In my opinion it is weird how in the United States we almost talk down about and undermine women\u2019s education yet the countries he most likely were referring to with low child out of wedlock rates value education for both genders. So to make a speech like this to women who\u2019s parents or they have just spent a lot of money is kind of unnecessary, insensitive and undermining. Plus in America all of these teachers and parents are saying the children can\u2019t read nor do math and are more behind than ever. Well in many conservative cultures they value education and having an education is basic in their countries. They understand that the mother is going to be your child\u2019s first teacher and whatever traits women have acquired to be successful in our lives and in pursuing  our education will be passed down to our children because we all first pair bond with our mothers and pick up little tiny habits from them that make substantial impact in our lives. I also heard an elderly Japanese man say while being interviewed in Japan about the birth and marriage rates that he made sure to say get married to a woman who has an education because your children will be smart too. My parents also said this to me growing up about making sure I have my own credits and education. I\u2019ve also heard this from Arabs, Koreans, Pakistanis, Indians, Chinese, Singaporeans but in America young men and some women are always talking about women being educated is part of the problem when in South Korea planes \u2708\ufe0f are down so that their sons AND DAUGHTERS pass their exams so that they can get into one of the top universities. They also go through great lengths to help their young people when it comes to their education. Even in the Jewish community women are educated. So you can see how it feels daunting when we see all of these articles on how poorly school children are doing in the states but then we turn around and discourage women from getting a degree only to look to more traditional and conservative cultures and try to strive to emulate what they have going on without actually knowing what they have going on. That\u2019s why in many countries there is no such thing as a gap year or men aren\u2019t staying in college. I\u2019m not at all saying it\u2019s 100% women\u2019s responsibility though I will say some cultures that we so conveniently bring up to prove our point\u2019s understand that the mother is the first teacher so women need an education and life experiences too.",

The other hand if trump gets elected many of these boot polishers want to make sure that trump is kind to them because they have sufficiently kissed Trump's ass. The problem for our country is trump isn't going to accept the election results unless he wins. So how far will maga base go in the name of trump. No matter what happens trump has put our country in the impossible position of moving forward as a united country. Trump has already destroyed the Republican party. My biggest concern is that he's already destroyed our country and the end will come in November regardless of who wins the election.",

Violence is a violation because it is the initiation of aggression, not self-defense. Offense/defense are ontologically distinct. All crime has a legal equivalent (ie, taxation is extortion).\n\nEvery government is founded on Ad Baculum. \n\nPetitio Principii can and will be used against you. \n\nWarren v.

Brute force is no longer necessary. \n\nThe capitalist priest class of Psychiatry, working in tandem with the State bureaucracy, regulates and polices the new Restriction and gelding of desire.

Any deviation is an indication of something severely wrong with the individual. \n\nPerhaps Lycanthropic Transformation Rites are in some way a Psychic Preparation for the millennial calamities that are thought to lie ahead. \n\nLegalism is a Language of Equivocations, a process of assimilation to violence and illogic.\n\nEtymology: government\nGubernare: to control\nMens/Mentis: mind\n\nculture\nColere: to inhabit, to till\nCult: collective mind\n-ure: process of\n\ncivilize, etc. \nCivitas: city\n-ize: to do/to make like\n\npolice, policy, politics, polite\nPolis: city\n\nauthority\nAuctor: master, father, creator\n-ity: quality of\n\nreligion\nReligare: to bind fast, to place an obligation on\n-ion: noun-forming suffix\n\nuniform\nUni-: one\nForm: shape\n\nThey lump themselves into a group.

    "This video is just another propaganda. The United States employed a propaganda strategy reminiscent of Nazi Germany, repeating a big lie over a thousand times: that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. Subsequently, the U.S.A used this lie as justification for invading Iraq and murdered large number of innocent civilians. Joseph Goebbels was the Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany employed a propaganda strategy: repeating a lie a thousand times until it became accepted as truth. The United States exhibits comparable levels of moral wrongdoing to Nazi Germany, if not surpassing them. The United States is currently spreading lies about China, aiming to deceive the world once more, and kill more innocent civilians. Currently, the United States is providing weapons to kill large numbers of innocent civilian in Gaza. At least 33,899 Palestinians has been killed since 7 October 2023 with American weapons. Despite Adolf Hitler's demise, numerous Nazis relocated from Germany to various destinations. Some held positions within the government, while others found roles in the private sector, such as media companies. A country cannot enact Jim Crow without the backing of hundreds of millions of supporters holding Nazi ideologies. One of the most frequently repeated lies by the Western media, reiterated over a thousand times, is the assertion that the United States is a democracy. The United States has a long history of committing massacres. My Lai Massacre revealed the insidious nature of United States. The My Lai Massacre was a mass killing of unarmed civilians by the United States that took place on March 16, 1968, when United States invaded Vietnam. It is estimated that between 347 and 504 Vietnamese civilians, including many women and children, were killed in the massacre. After the Massacre, United States's attempts to cover up the massacre further revealed the evil nature of United States. The 2017 Mosul Massacre revealed the insidious nature of United States. March 17, 2017, in the city of Mosul, Iraq, United States killed over 100 civilians, including women and children. After the Massacre, United States's attempts to denied responsibility for the civilian deaths further revealed the evil nature of United States.",

Putin would care less about money. I also am concerned because Trump stated we might see a terrorist attack by China, that that's part of his deal with Putin.

    "What makes Israel unique is its claim to represent an entire religious group, asserting that Jews worldwide constitute a nation. Israel positions itself to the Jews what France is to the French, what Japan is to the Japanese, what Germany is to Germans. The Zionist perspective deliberately avoids equating Israel to Israelis to preserve their foundational narrative. This distinction is a fundamental deception. Many countries have Christian majorities (e.g., USA, Brazil, Russia, Mexico), but none claim to represent all Christians globally. Similarly, there are numerous Muslim-majority countries (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Malaysia) but none assert they represent all Muslims worldwide. Israel uniquely claims to represent all Jewish people. This concept allows a Jew from Brooklyn, New York, to settle in Israel based on a dubious 3,000-year-old biblical claim, while a Palestinian is unable to return to land they lived on for centuries. Zionism is built on this fusion of religious and national identity, a concept formulated by early Zionist leaders, as there is no single Jewish ethnic group.",

    "Somewhere along the way, we became a people and country obsessed with numbering everything by the colors, and Then We Got Lazy.\r\n\r\nThere was a time in this country when we identified people in our census by their respective ethic groups.  Then we got lazy and decided to lump people into groups by color, and still mucked that up since some in the \u2018white\u2019 group definitely were not \u2018white\u2019, or so history says so.\r\n\r\nThere was a time in this country when we had a system of warning, known as DEFCON that was numbered 1-5, where one we were in the most imminent danger and five we could be very relaxed.  Then we got lazy and decided to color code the danger, simplifying and confusing everyone at the same time.  \r\n\r\nAs a people, we too got lazy because we saw people as color.  We use color to confuse and distort truth by showing color graphs, instead of simple to follow numbers and lines.\r\n\r\nSome may be too young to know these facts.\r\n\r\nToday, in this country, my ethnic group is considered \u201cwhite\u201d.  We were considered no higher than the rats on the streets, but somewhere along the way, someone showed a color graph and convinced a very white person that this group was too also white and should be admitted to the group.  Yes, there is sarcasm there, but only to emphasize a point and fact.\r\n\r\nAs a people, we too got lazy with religions because we saw religions as hate groups associated through color.  \r\n\r\nWe give rise and concern that every Muslim is a terrorist, when in fact the terror comes from the Nation of Islam.  Every religion has its own faction of hate within, that\u2019s a fact shown in lined graphs without colors, and simple numbers that are easy to follow.  Just look at the FBI\u2019s yearly report and the clear evidence in our country is white Christian evangelicals.  They point to the Ku Klux Klan, Aryan Nations, or the White Aryan Resistance as \u201cno more than 5% of all hate crimes nationally are committed by the members of [these] organizations \u2026\u201d.  The report continues with \u201cgroups of white supremacists continue behind the scenes to inspire murder, assault, and vandalism.  They encourage and support much larger numbers of violent offenses committed by non-members \u2013 alienated teenagers, skinheads, offenders looking for excitement, \u2026 \u2013 who, in general, are not clever enough to figure out the consequences of the ideology of hate. Several studies indicate that the most violent hate crimes are those committed by far-right hate groups.\u201d  That initial 5% grows exponentially when those non-members are included in that group as a hole.  The scary part of this is that to every \u201cnon-white\u201d and \u201cnon-Christian\u201d this report implies or infers almost every white Christian is a hater.\r\n\r\nI wonder if our \u2018Gods\u2019 had used tone to represent differences.  Tone, as in white and black \u2026 not as the known use of skin color, but instead representing simply light from darkness, day from night, good from evil.  The only time \u201ccolor\u201d is applied and is known to be true in every sense.  Here in America, we know it best in our movies \u2013 the hero is always dressed in white while the villain is dressed in black; good is always represented with white like and angels wings and black like the devil\u2019s eyes.\r\n\r\nSo why is it that we just can\u2019t simply put people into two groups of white and black.  The white group contains every race, creed, color and religious group of people that are good.  The black group contains every race, creed, color and religious group of people that are bad.  Is it that simple or simply Then We Got Lazy?\r\n\r\nReally, when did man get so lazy?",

A president found guilty of bashing and raping Ivana Trump 1990 and he has been found guilty of  rape  EJ Carrol and calls her names and hasn't been jailed ?  His supporters harmed people on Jan 6th, police died and he watched on TV. Those  people are in jail and he hasn't faced a court in four years  ? He calls them hostages and calls woman vile names.Really America where is your respect for this vile man coming from?

    "Catherine's grace and strength are amazing. When I heard she had surgery and it looked to be a relatively extensive hospital stay and recovery, I thought, Oh no, I hope she doesn't have cancer. It's especially hard when cancer strikes multiple family members. We've been through that.\n\nI remember trying to be calm and strong when telling my kids I have an inoperable cancer. And telling them a few years later that their stepdad had it; he only survived a year. My in-laws both had cancer. Just 2 months after my husband died, my son had emergency surgery to remove a tumor as well and is now enduring 3 years of cancer meds to prevent it from recurring, especially since he is the youngest patient his doctors have ever heard of having his type. \n\nAs the late great Gilda Radner said, cancer is the most unfun thing in the world. My kids are in their 30s but my husband and I have been honorary grandparents to the kids next door and while we explained as best we could, it's difficult with young ones even though I had the experience of helping my kids through my mother-in-law's death when they were little. Especially my tumor, because the young ones can't get their heads around the concept of inoperable. \n\nI certainly wish Catherine all the best in her journey. Its not easy even when the results are good.",

    "Well, the Russians are certainly trying to make this issue Biden\u2019s Vietnam. Putin is financing Hamas through Iran - the Houthis as well by the way. As an interesting little piece of trivia is that Putin is known to time major actions to coincide with dates important for him - and October 7th happens to be his birthday. Coincidence? Sure, let\u2019s call it that. Also, I\u2019m completely against Bibi, he is Israel\u2019s Trump who is benefiting from this war politically (all trials against him are on hold now) but I will just note that Hamas could stop the violence this minute. They attacked first and they are still holding hostages. And they seem perfectly fine exposing their own people to the Israeli army. Biden is the president of the U.S. - and it is in the US\u2019s interest that Israel, the region\u2019s only democracy, is not eliminated and \u201cpushed into the sea\u201d as Hamas would like to do. Should the U.S. give weapons to Israel like it does right now? In that light, yes - but maybe the amount and structure of the aid should be revisited. So in that sense I agree with the protesters - they have a point. Absolutely. But that point cannot be made through violence and anti-Jewish sentiments.",

(there is nothing its todays catholic beliefs That says that women should only strive to have children even after spending four years of their life working for a a future career) therefore this was inappropriate and unnecessary for the occasion.\n\nSecondly onto the \"pride\" part. While being gay is seen as a sin in Catholic belief, it does not change the fact that it is not, seen as a deadly sin because all sins are equal in the eyes of God (that is a real catholic belief) Even the Catholic pope himself said that we have no right to judge because God judges for us. There was absolutely no need for him to mention them in the first place, and it was also incorrect for him to call being part of the pride community, a deadly sin, when its just a sin.

Most people don't understand anything about Palestine or the terrorist group known as israel. Hamas on the other hand was started by 3 Palestinian children who survived Israeli extermination squads roaming around Palestine Mass murdering palestinians. Yet any Western person has been taught to believe that Hamas is nothing more than a terrorist organization. In 2023 by October 7th Israel had already murdered 50 Children just in the city of Gaza alone just in the year 2023. October 7th was a retaliation to take hostages in order for Palestine to receive their thousands of illegally held and tortured and murdered hostages back from israel. Any person on Earth would do exactly the same thing Hamas has done to Revenge the senseless killing, ethnic cleansing and genocide of themselves. Any person would be proud to fight back against the Israeli terrorist group. What would you do? The Nakba genocide has been going on since the 1940s and it has done nothing but results in no change for the Palestinians and the genocide and extermination of their internationally recognized and protected borders. Jewish squatters are stealing homes while killing the inhabitants. Hamas, Palestine and anyone else on this Earth has every right to defend Palestine or come to their defense in any way that they can. They should be proud to do so and they should not stop no matter what.

We have being continuously and daily hear that was a very unlucky, unhappy humanly contact to Mrs. Stormy Daniels. \r\n\r\nBut, she has got a sweet, lovely daughter. Almighty, Lovely God may bless, save, keep, protect, support and love  Mrs Stormy Daniels' lovely, sweet daughter. \r\n\r\nIt has been an unlucky, destructive, very malign issue and psychic trauma in her child- soul, if Mrs. Stormy Daniels would continue her malign, destructive black- mailer role in life of our great former President, Mr. Donald Trump. Because, it is evident and clear, that some dark circles have misused and provoked Mrs. Stormy Daniels against former President Mr. Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stormy Daniels should never forget it, what bad things have done bad things, their own children must get it again back.

The true, objectively explaining of this devastating, deadly, devilish plot and attack against the family Trump and the lovely children of former President Mr. Donald Trump. \r\n\r\nIt is possible, that not less than 30 per cent of humans were one time in their life involved with an unlucky, humanly life- situation, conflict like this by Mrs. Stormy Daniels. But it is throughout possible to correct that own mistake. Lovely Jesus had also devilish black mailed, we never forget it!\r\n\r\nMrs. Stormy Daniels should again and over again think about it what would happen in the next coming cosmic life with all us. Nobody can know it exact what would after this life in heaven would with all of us again happen!. \r\n\r\nIt is really in favor of sweet, lovely daughter by Mrs. Stormy Daniels, if she  would correct her devastating black mail role in this humanly affair. It was much more for lovely, sweet daughter if Mrs. Stormy Daniels would give in and correct her devilish black mailer role in this completely Anti- Christian, inhumanly, very devastating, even deadly affair. \r\n\r\nI know this as an experienced retired Psychiatrist for child and adolescent. This is a very destructive, devilish involving role in a possible very unlucky psychic assessment and trauma against life of Mr. Donald Trump, against his lovely wife and also against his great, lovely children. \r\n\r\nBut, it is also a very devastating, destructive issue against the sweet, lovely young daughter by Mrs. Stormy Daniels. It would be much better, if Mrs. Stormy Daniels were never involved in such a satanist, devilish, devastating, very destructive and unlucky conflict and issue and plot against former President, Mr. Donald Trump, his lovely family and against his lovely children.\r\n\r\n I swear for Almighty and Lovely God, that this deadly fact would be one day opened, rolled and explained again according to the scientific Psychiatry for child and adolescent. Almighty, lovely God is very patient, tolerant and forgiving if the humans would apologize themselves by Him  for a constructive, productive, peaceful, humanly deciding. \r\n\r\nAnd, nobody would be so self- confident and certain,  without any lovely, great, generous help, support, mercy, forgiving and also love of Almighty, Lovely God..

If a president can do whatever he wants, he could sell US\u2019s secrets to its enemies to earn a buck, as Trump has demonstrated he would stop at nothing to do so. Besides, Trump has committed obstruction for refusing to return those boxes. PLUS, Trump was caught on audio admitting that the documents he was shuffling in front of strangers (with no clearance) were not classified. But even if they were, there is a procedure for that and a record is generated. There is no proof that he did such a thing. He is clearly lying and we all know it. And this lawyer is clearly making Trump\u2019s bid. Again, why would CNN give this dishonest lawyer a platform and air time?",

I think he would make a wonderful addition to Trump\u2019s administration. He seems to be honest and to have integrity, as well as a desire to help American citizens. As a worldwide businessman, Musk has plenty of experience with world leaders. He seems to have a respect for them, as they also seem to respect him. No doubt, Musk certainly has business knowledge that could benefit America, as well as absolute knowledge of what would and wouldn\u2019t be good for this country. He also has common sense. He cares about others and can distinguish right from wrong. With so much responsibility of so many projects and acquisitions at this time, this would probably be a very stressful time for him to add President of the US. He may be open to taking on a less time and energy consuming government appointment at this election. I\u2019m sure he would be a welcomed addition to one of many jobs in Trump\u2019s Administration that wouldn\u2019t be as demanding and would allow him more time with his many creations, investments, and responsibilities. Then President of the US could be a great job for him as he sees his current responsibilities take off so keenly that they won\u2019t need his personal imput as much as they do now.",

    "Trust in Jesus today as your savior from hell. Christ is the only solution to the sin problem in our world and the eternal penalty as a result, which is ultimately part of our nature passed down from adam and eve due to their rebellion against God. The good news is that there is a savior from the penalty of sin that God the father sent, and that is his only Son Jesus Christ, born of a virgin and without a sin nature like the rest of mankind. The father established the Old Testament law, which was morally perfect to show man's imperfection in attempting to keep it. But Jesus, being perfect, kept the law perfectly, thus fulfilling the law. However, he didnt just fulfill the law, he also died on the cross as a substitute for all mankind's sin. The penalty for sin is death, so God sent his own son to pay the penalty for Mankind so we dont have to go to hell. The lake of fire is referred to as \"eternal/spiritual death\" so when Christ died for you and me, he satisfied the father's wrath against our sin. Afterwards, he was buried and then rose again after 3 days, conquering the grave.  He did this so that mankind can recieve eternal life as a free gift, all you have to do is believe it was done for you. The gospel of john states \"He that believeth on the son hath everlasting life, but he that believeth NOT the son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him.\" Believe in the original Greek language translates to \"pistueo\" which means to entrust, in this case, to entrust ones eternal destination to Christ. Ephesians 2:8-9 \"for by grace you have been saved through faith, and not of yourselves it is a GIFT of God. Not of works lest anyman should boast.\" Simply believe what Christ already did for you to receive eternal life.",

Their expectations were completely delusional and their advice was beyond incompetent. \n\nTheir entire plan to have the Ukrainians attack en masse across minefields and without any air support was criminal. The only possible outcome was getting tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers killed which is exactly what happened. Somehow, a couch expert like me knew this would happen and they didn't? Either they're totally incompetent and full of hubris or the US wanted this to happen because they don't care about how many Ukrainians die as long as it degrades the Russian military. \n\nZaluzhny, to his credit, resisted the US pressure to launch the counteroffensive as long as he could \u2013\u2013 the Americans wanted to start in April. Also, after the first couple of weeks when he did it the way the US generals pressured him into doing it and saw the results -- his troops getting absolutely massacred, he changed tactics which infuriated the Americans but saved a lot of lives. That's why he's so popular among the rank and file of the Ukrainian military. It's also why the Americans are now pressuring Zelensky to get rid of him.",

    "If Donald J Trump has chosen just to hint at the possibility of violence if he should lose, that is if he has suggested that his loss will result in violence, I believe he should be immediately disqualified from running. Our elections have--until Trump's involvement in the January 6, 2021 situation--rested on the presumption of non-violence and he has left that \"option\" open. (He and he alone has raised that as an option, indicating that he will not accept the possibility that you can lose any election. He is threatening all of us with violence if we don't vote as he has chosen. He doesn't say so in so many words but a veiled threat--backed up by previous events and experience with violence on his behalf--is still a threat. We simply cannot have a democratic election where violence is threatened or suggested as a possibility. (His run for the presidency should end right now and it has nothing whatsoever to do with his own political position, persuasion, and thought because, if he thought he could make headway on his scheme to transform us into an autocracy (with himself as autocrat) as a Dem, he would gladly switch and leave the GOP in the lurch.) I think his efforts to delay his many criminal trials should cease; all his trials should be scheduled; and the influence of the Supreme COurt and Trump-appointed justices should cease.

During their meeting, prosecutors said Uribe agreed he would tell investigators the car payments were loans. \r\n\r\nThe couple is now charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly falsely characterizing the return of bribe money as repayment for loans.",

    "So Trump vows to release the insurrectionists from prison.\nPeople who vote for Trump should think of this: if an assault on the capitol becomes the new normal, then what kind of fate awaits the US? Trump could send these people to attack the Capitol next time, too, if the outcome of the elections doesn't suit him, and next time maybe they'll win. Even if they lose, Trump could simply pardon them again. They can try again and again, until they win. I think they can try as many times until one attempt succeeds, and that's the end of democracy.\nThat's why people should always be valiant. One mistake, and it's over. It's not necessary to be afraid of this,  because It's very easy to prevent this from happening. It just needs people to vote for someone who's valuing and respecting the basics of democracy, and valuing that above all else.\nI think democracy is precious. You see all around the world how countries descend into horrible oppressive environments because of budding dictators. I think democracy is more important than something like economy.\nI think an example of that is what's happening in Turkey. Erdogan had a good economy running at one point, and people trusted him in everything, even though he was dismantling democracy in full daylight. Then later on, everything went south. He mismanaged the economy and Turkey's basically bankrupt. However, he was already entrenched and now they can't get rid of him anymore.\nYou can also see how China and Russia as being pulled into a black hole too, because of incredible corruption of untouchable autocrats who value their own power above everything else.\nThat's why I think democracy comes first. It's the only way to get rid of people who mess things up. Without democracy, you see it all around the world, the economy ultimately crashes, because a single person, with delusions of grandeur, cannot decide what's best for the people - only what's best for them and for their power base, and everything else comes second, including the economy.",

Most non-Anglo people of all races have advocacy groups or organizations that they celebrate their culture with.

We were called Black because it was the name that was chosen for us. In the same way that certain dog whistles like Africans selling each other to Europeans are used at times where they are inconvenient and unnecessary filler and distraction away from the main conversation which is the fact that race was imposed on Black people who were and WERE NOT slaves.

    "I'm a Asian, I have seen news about Israel and Palestine conflict from kindergarten. 2021 I have visited Shanghai library. There's I read about Israel and Palestine. Back then 17th century there is no such country name Israel. It was Palestine. then 1865 Jewish people started came here as a refuge. Then they started making progress they created their own society called Zionist. 1948 This Zionist decided to create there own country, because they had to share everything with native Palestrina civilians. 1917 Zionist helped British to win World War II. As a returned gift British promised Zionist they will a separate nation. After ottoman Empire fall, Palestine became under British rule. And British divided Palestine into two nation, the New nation is Israel. But this make anger to native Civilians. British has no right to gave their land to occupier. But Evil British left before they fix this wrong doing. Palestine has no choice so they asked UN to help But UN also a loyal dog to UK and US. So UN gave the favor on Israel side. and Make official statement Israel would be a country. UK and US secretly help Israel with money and weapons and Israel made a promised they will be ally to US and UK forever. After Israel got help from US and UK they started taking over more land area by killing Palestinian. Israel started taking the border area first and build long Wall so Palestinian can get any help from others. But some how they manage to ask Arab to help them to get their land back. But It was to late Israel already became very strong by getting support from US and UK. 1948 Arab-Israeli war started but Arab lost it. But Palestine didn't lose their hope to getting back their lands. 1948-2023 Palestinian fighting against these Zionist occupier but US and UK  Daddy and Mommy holding them back. Israel also working for US and UK to kill those who a threat to US and UK. There is another funny mention 9/11 also happened because of this. Osama bin Laden send a letter to US and asked them stop supporting Israel. Israel was behind assassination of  Egyptian president. \n\nAfter read about all of this I feel sympathy for Palestrina people. and I think If US and UK are so care about Israel why they took them all and let them make there country in US or UK land. you guys have platy of land. But Here comes politic. Israel is the only nation can do anything for US and UK. Israel recently attacked Iran's embassy and killed top general of Iran's army. Iran and Israel has no problem to each others. But US asked that. US just using Israel to take control over Middle East. That called International politic.",

    "The Biden administration denounced efforts by the International Criminal Court to seek arrest warrants for top Israeli officials and Hamas leaders, saying the court\u2019s efforts put the terrorist organization and a top US ally on equivalent footing.\n\r\nICC prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that the tribunal is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. \u201cNobody is above the law,\u201d he said.\n\r\nThe United Nations said more than 900,000 people, approximately 40% of Gaza's population, have been displaced in the past two weeks as Israeli bombardment continues across much of the enclave.\n\nThe UK is among the 124 countries that have signed up to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC. While it's true that Israel is not a signatory (neither is the United States), the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. A group of international legal experts issued a report on Monday, saying they that they believe the court has jurisdiction over the crimes set out in Khan's application.\n\nA group of international legal experts including human rights barrister Amal Clooney and the former president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Judge Theodor Meron, has issued a report in support of the decision by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan to apply for arrest warrants against the top leaders of Hamas and Israel.\r\n\r\nThe panel was convened by Khan to review the evidence and legal analysis underpinning his application.\r\n\r\nThey said there were \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that individuals named in the arrest warrants have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity.\r\n\r\nKhan is seeking arrest warrants against Hamas' leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, who is the leader of the Al Qassem Brigades and is better known as Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019 political leader \u2014 over the October 7 attacks into southern Israel.\r\n\r\nKhan is also seeking warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over Israel's military assault in Gaza.\r\n\r\nClooney and Meron were joined by several other renowned legal experts: Lord Justice Fulford who is a former ICC judge; Baroness Helena Kennedy, the director of the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute; and human rights and international law experts Danny Friedman and Elizabeth Wilmshurst.",

    "Bernie Sanders is wrong about one thing, Hamas didn't start this war. It was started by the zionists terror group and militas like Ingrim and Hagnah before the israeli occupation in Palestine began, by sweaping through Palestine murdering villagers. On Aoril 8th 1948, Haganah soldiers murdered 250 women, children and men in the village of Deir Yassin. Before they got shoot they people were made to undress and they were photgraphed. When the news of this spread through Palestine people fleed creating the refugee crisis that is still ongoing today. How the U.N gave 55% of Palestine to European Jews, 55% of land they didn't own. It began with the British, of course, getting mandate over Palestine in 1923. The Balfour decleration in 1917 which promised a homeland for the Jewish people. The Brtish never intended to keep that promise to an organization called the zionist movement. The League of Nation held the British accountable in 1923 to this promise so mass imports of Jewsih people began to Palestine, it was then when the trouble began for real because of what I describe above. To blame Hamas for everything is redicilous, yes Hamas is horrible, but the \"IDF\", israel \"defence\" army, which has invaded other countries like Lebanon and Egypt is no better. The israli army is worse because it is an army, Palestine has no army.",

    "Claiming (without evidence) that he had opposed the invasion of Iraq, Trump lambasted the bipartisan foreign policy establishment for its decades of disastrous militarism. For a war-weary nation desperate for change, this was evidence enough that Trump would be different. The \u201canti-war\u201d label stuck, and it would be repeated over and over, up to the very\u00a0final days\u00a0of his presidency.\nBut with four years of accumulated evidence all pointing in the same direction, it\u2019s time to kill this myth once and for all. Sure, Donald Trump didn\u2019t launch a new all-out ground invasion on the scale of Iraq. But he did escalate conflict in every theatre of war he inherited, repeatedly brought the country to the brink of new wars, and recklessly threw around U.S. power with no regard for the many lives it would cost. The \u201canti-war\u201d candidate, like those before him, was a pro-war president",

    "Thank you for this information. I just want to share this.\n\nDeath is a rest in sleep until the resurrection. There are no disembodied spirits hovering around to communicate with the living. Although the pagans believed in a spirit world, the Israelites understood death as a sleep until resurrection morning.\r\n\r\nThough we mourn for the dead, think this way about those who die in Christ: they close their eyes in death, and then, regardless of how long it takes until Jesus returns, the next thing they know is the Second Coming. The first thought they might have at the resurrection is Wow! Jesus really did come back soon after all!\n\nBoth the Old and New Testaments use the symbolism of death as a sleep. At least 53 times in the Bible, the word \u201csleep\u201d is equated with death. The Bible writers concur that there is no conscious existence in an immortal soul that leaves the body immediately after death.\n\nA failure to understand the truth about death leaves us open to the deceptions of Satan. \u201cMany will be confronted by the spirits of devils personating beloved relatives or friends and declaring the most dangerous heresies. These visitants will appeal to our tenderest sympathies and will work miracles to sustain their pretensions. We must be prepared to withstand them with the Bible truth that the dead know not anything and that they who thus appear are the spirits of devils.\u201d\u2014Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 560.",

They abandoned the car in the forest and tried to cross the forest to Ukraine on foot. Border guards and search engines found and captured them, some criminals tried to climb a tree to hide, but they were found too. They are already giving evidence confirming the fact of Ukraine's involvement in the terrorist attack. Also, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Danilov gave an interview after the terrorist attack in which he said \"we can build fireworks in Moscow again,\" about the terrorist attack. I think all adequate people understand that the terrorist attack was created by Ukraine. Why are we helping Ukraine? Killing ordinary people?",

If Trump loses the nomination or the general election, yes, then they will throw him under the bus and allow for Trump to be prosecuted and potentially imprisoned. But they really want their dense, orange and transactional rubber stamp signing legislation that their attorneys author and hand to Mike Johnson and Mitch McConnell.\n\nMoreover, the Republican primary is just political camouflage, providing a pyrrhic alternative to Trump that crypto-fascists can pretend to support in the open. But in fact, Trump's primary victory is inevitable, because he has the unyielding support of the Republican Party electorate. That includes religious fanatics, racists, and other complete lunatics and ignorant fools. And since the billionaire donor class has subjected us to a presidential primary with numerous candidates, the opposition to Trump has splintered into smaller factions and fractions, which may ultimately result in a Trump general election victory. \n\nThe fight has already been fixed and tipped in Trump's favor. Because if he goes down, he'll start talking. Trump, it's reasonable to believe, has dirty laundry that implicates Republican leadership and others in government and media (classified documents), as well as kompromat provided to him by the Russians. Furthermore, Trump has been, and will always be, a puppet of moneyed interests (domestic and foreign) that engaged in criminal activity to help make him president the first time. \n\nTrump has no scruples. He's an animal driven by his insatiable appetite with no self-control. He's a pig; a thief, rapist and murderer. He has no feeling towards others, except what he can take from them. He precisely fits the profile of the monster that billionaires, corporate oligarchs, and dictators want at their beck and call, commanding the mightiest military in the history of the world.\n\nAs long as Trump gets his big lick, screw everyone else, including democracy and America itself. He's perfectly happy to allow America to become a client state of whomever or whatever provides him with personal wealth and comfort. Trump doesn't care about who or what suffers in the process. \n\nIn my assessment, Nikki Haley is just a diversion, kabuki theater, political posturing. But does she know that? Maybe not.

    "Adult film actress Stormy Daniels, a central figure in the criminal case against Donald Trump, is set to return to the stand Thursday following her testimony today in the New York hush money trial.\n\r\nDuring the prosecution's questioning, Daniels detailed her alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and walked the jury through the $130,000 hush money payment from Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen shortly before the 2016 election. She was pressed by Trump's attorneys on her credibility in multiple tense exchanges.\n\r\nThe hush money payment, and how it was reimbursed to Cohen, is at the heart of the charges. Trump, who was in court as Daniels testified, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and has denied the affair.\n\r\nThe judge denied a motion for a mistrial from the defense who argued that Daniels\u2019 explicit testimony went too far. Daniels is the prosecution's 13th witness.\n\nStormy Daniels is now testifying that she told the story about her sexual encounter with Trump on a radio show in 2007.\r\n\r\nTrump attorney Susan Necheles clarifies that she wrote names down on a paper of famous people she'd slept with.\r\n\r\nDaniels says she mentioned Lake Tahoe and a hotel room which was \"obviously\" about Trump.\r\n\r\nNecheles asks Daniels whether she told Anderson Cooper, \"I never told this story publicly before because I was threatened.\" She says that's correct.\n\nSusan Necheles asks Stormy Daniels if she believed Michael Cohen sent \"that man in the garage,\" referring to a 2011 incident where Daniels says a man threatened her in a parking lot while she was on her way to a mommy-and-me class with her infant daughter.",

Meanwhile, Russia is not only dishing out 5:1 or 10:1 artillery barrage disparities, but even more devastating long range missile strikes, most of which go unreported and unglamorized because there are simply so many.\r\n\r\nThe point is that, these are daily, almost mundane, strikes by Russian long range assets which are wiping out anything from dozens to hundreds of troops at a time. - Simplicius",

    "Asked on Quora: *\"Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?\"*  An articulate and witty writer from England, *Nate White,* wrote the following very apt response, *sentiments shared by people around the world in general* \u2026\n\n\u201cA few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace; all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed. So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump\u2019s limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief.\n\nPlus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing. Not once, ever. I don\u2019t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever.\n\nAnd that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility. For us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it\u2019s a fact. He doesn\u2019t even seem to understand what a joke is. His idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.\n\nTrump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn\u2019t just talk in crude, witless insults, he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.\n\nThere is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It\u2019s all surface. Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don\u2019t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.\n\nAnd in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He\u2019s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He\u2019s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.\n\nAnd worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead. There are unspoken rules to this stuff, the Queensberry rules of basic decency, and he breaks them all. He punches downwards, which a gentleman should, would, could never do, and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless, and he kicks them when they are down.\n\nSo the fact that a significant minority, perhaps a third, of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think \u2018Yeah, he seems like my kind of guy\u2019 is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:\n\n- Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are.\n\n- You don\u2019t need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man.\n\nThis last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it\u2019s impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss.\n\nHe turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart.\n\nIn fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws, he would make a Trump. And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumps of hair and scream in anguish: \u2018My God, what have I created?\u2019\n\nIf being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.\u201d",

    "LIST OF INTRNATIONAL LAW VIOLATIONS BY THE STATE OF ISREAL \n\nThe state of Israel has violated many international laws, including United Nations Resolutions and the Laws of War and Occupation as stated in the . Below is a summary of some of those violations. Much of the fact sheet was taken from the Israeli Law Resource Center (ILRC). Related articles and laws by the ILRC are linked below. \n\nISRAELI OCCUPATION IS ILLEGAL: \n\nLaws Violated: U.N. Charter, Article 2(4) & 51 (1945); Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations\u2026, Principle 1 (1970). \n\nIsraeli Actions: It is illegal under international law to acquire land by force: Israel annexed land occupied by force during 1948 and 1967 wars (lands other than those given by the UN 1947-48 partition plan) . Military action and occupations are legal only if they are for self-defense, or to directly benefit the native population. But studies show Israel is not just defending itself as it develops de-facto annexation with its settlements and separation barrier on occupied land, as it takes over most of the occupied territories (over 70%) and its natural resources for its own use and economic benefit, at the expense of the native population. \n\nILLEGAL ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS ON OCCUPIED LAND: \n\nLaws Violated: Geneva Conventions IV, Article 49(6) (1949). It is illegal to colonize occupied land or transfer non-indigenous population to that land. \n\nIsraeli Actions: Immediately following the 1967 war, Israel began building Israeli civilian settlements on Palestinian lands, eventually building over 200 settlements throughout the occupied territories, and settling over 450,000 Israeli civilians in them, displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians from their own legally owned lands. In addition, Israeli citizens live in hundreds of Israeli settlements on occupied land not originally given to them in the UN Partition Plan, displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. \n\nILLEGAL TO TAKE LAND BY FORCE & CLAIM SOVEREIGNTY: \n\nLaws Violated: U.N. Charter, Article 2(4) (1945); Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations\u2026, Principle 1 (1970). \n\nIsraeli Actions: In violation of the UN Partition Plan, Israel took an extra 15% of the land in 1948, and then, following the 1967 war, Israel confiscated East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. \n\nILLEGAL ISRAELI PRACTICE OF ETHNIC CLEANSING: \n\nLaws Violated: Forbidding civilian populations the right to return to their homes following the end of armed conflict is in direct violation of international law and UN resolutions. Geneva Convention IV, Articles 45, 46 & 49 (1949), UN resolutions 194 (III) (General Assembly; 1948) & 237 (Security Council; 1967",
    "It may well be that the party divots and fair enough, but in this video clip, Anderson, whom I've enjoyed for years, rationalizes, and I'd say dismisses, something very real he and his network are engaged in: imbalanced reporting. I'm hardly the first person to express my disappointment in CNN. I had CNN on as background noise the other day, prior to finally cutting back on my CNN watching, as I got some work done. The entire day was ripping Biden a new one, with hardly a moment to take on Trump and his brand of insanity. There was but just a moment where a female Democratic strategist pointed out to the panel that she served on the imbalance that was happening. Her comment wasn't addressed at all and the panel just moved on. I think the best journalists take responsibility for imbalanced reporting when it happens. I think the best journalists have self-doubt, always questioning themselves. I have nothing personal against Anderson, and am trying to remain a fan, but I don't think it's honest to say, paraphrasing horribly, \"I didn't do anything wrong. I'm just accurately reporting.\" He may be accurately reporting. That doesn't mean two things can't be true at the same time. There is, am experiencing it, accurate but also imbalanced reporting. Question is: Is reporting still accurate when it is imbalanced?",

Biden has about 3,900 pledged delegates and that is more than double the number needed to secure the democratic nomination.  So all this talk about democrats replacing Biden at the top of the ticket was pure BS from the very beginning.  They cannot force Joe out.  This is Biden's decision, and his decision alone to make now that the primaries are over.  He said he is committed to staying in and there is nothing his detractors can do about it.  Nothing.  Even wealthy donors cannot force Biden out if he doesn't want to leave the race.  They can keep the money in their wallet if they want to but they cannot coerce Biden and force him to quit.  All of this drama is only helping Donald Trump.  If these so called democrats don't want Trump to win then get behind President Biden and support him.

That is just under half the total number of homicides in the entire UK (590) in 2023 with a population of 68 million (29 homicides by gun in the UK).  Japan is even safer with 913 homicides in a population of c. 120 million and in a typical year has 4-8 homicides by gun.

Many think I am afraid to fight around here in WV, but I turn the other cheek until I forgave them enough times and they kept doing the same ugly deed against me. Woman, you look ugly sitting on that fruit cake snake like a desperate witch in heat of the sperm witch devil.

This is Biden barking and the Pentagon's hard men throwing a lifeline to the dictator who is in Deep Do Do---I of course do not know---but my guess is that Putin wants out of his campaign of pain in the Ukraine and he knows his fleet in the Sea of Azov would go up in smoke and down to Davy Jones' Locker if he pulls the nuclear cord and snuffs the Ukrainian President and fries the capital. Putin sees the cryptic hieroglyphs i.e., the writing on the wall and by having Tucker Carlson be his spokesman of praise from the evil empire America is portrayed to be to ordinary Russians. It is a subtle way of letting the Russian people know America is going to go to war against them by having a far-right spokesman for the ultra-conservatives in America visit Putin. President Biden sees that Putin's in a fix, but he does not want American boots on the ground in the Ukraine. In short, he knows Putin wants to find a way to put this all behind him and hit the road and so he can fade away in his Dacha before the FSB says 'gotcha'. Tucker Carlson might be Putin's only ticket to ride and a way to save face, because he knows the war in Ukraine is about to blow up his dream big time...",

    "So far after impeachments, indictments and lawsuits, Trump has always come out innocent or it came out the accusations were a sham to discredit and sully him. How many more fake lawsuits do we need? As much as the Biden administration would love for Trump to lose the election, I don't think making him a Martyr is a good strategy.  Having his innocence proven lawsuit after indictment after impeachment only serves to tear apart the last vestiges of negative opinion that people had about him.  Now it even goes as far as having the White House investigated for collusion with the legal system.\r\nTrump did more for gays and blacks than Biden in his mandate, he was the first white business man to endorse a black politician. The false narrative pushed by the media that he is a racist has all but imploded . With X refusing to do the FBI's bidding, the shaming strategy of the democrats has all but cataclysmically collapsed.  Trump blocked Epstein from his Mar El Lago property because of his manners with young women. Now we still have to find out the remaining names on the list. I wouldn't be surprised if it did implicate the Biden family.\r\nContrary to Biden's children, his children are all well-educated, polite and kind, and not creepy child predators. The love they have for their father is so apparent compared to Biden's dysfunctional family (his own daughter writes in her book about his incestuous tendencies) that Trump now comes across a God's chosen. At this rate he will win by a landslide. Even CNN seems resigned by now.\nSociopaths always project their own flaws onto other people. Follow the trail of accusations against  Trump and you realize they all mirror the actual failures and flaws of Hillary (documents, Russian collusion hoax), Biden (documents, predation, racism), and Pelosi (staged insurrection). If Republicans spent even 1% of the energy that has been deployed to hurt Trump, those 3 would crash and burn. Absolutely fascinating how things have turned out. When I think I was one of the people who believed the media narrative a few years back.  I feel ashamed of myself for being so naive and easy to fool!\n\nI can't even believe the level of wickedness required to devise all of those simultaneous strategies to hurt a political opponent through weaponization of the legal system. It is absolutely incredible! Out of all the hoaxes, I think J6 and the evidence tampering by the FBI in the documents case shows how intelligence agencies had such a big part in planning for Trump's demise.  It feels like I am watching the series Billions, or Suits, except here the villains are so much better and the plot is so much more creative than in the series! The media realize it by now and they all seem as stunned as I am!",

    "The Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant in Armenia was chosen as the most dangerous reactor in the world due to its design in the 1960s. The nuclear reactor should have been close a long time ago. Because it spreads radiation to Europe and other continents. Radioactive and chemical wastes of the Nuclear Power Plant enter the Caspian Sea through rivers and then into the oceans through other rivers. The NPP is located in a seismic country and a strong earthquake can occur at any time. Armenia should be sanctioned and embargoed to close this reactor. This environmental terrorism must be stopped. \u0422he number of cancer patients in the world is increasing rapidly due to nuclear power plants. The government of Armenia, which is a military-economic ally of the invading Russia \u0430nd receives financial and military support from it, should think about the health of the peoples of Europe. The Prime Minister of Japan said that the chemical and radioactive waste of nuclear power plants in Japan will be discharged into the ocean. As a result of water circulation and rainfall, plants will absorb toxic water. There will be radiation in drinking water and cancer patients will increase. Russia's political and military leadership is planning armed sabotage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Mines are buried in the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from all sides. Explosives are placed inside the reactors. World leaders must stop this ecological disaster",

The vast number of people who sympathize with the Palestinian population must be suppressed and the number of civilian casualties must be hushed up.

Second, it is too presumptuous of those who infer that it is a given that SCOTUS would agree with the lower courts. As much as I despise Trump and his MAGA gang, I do not dismiss his claim here. While discharging his/her duty, a POTUS is held accountable by Congress through impeachment and removal from office, after which he/she could be put on trial for the crime for which he/she was removed from office. It is reasonable to wonder if Trump was discharging his duty when he incited the insurrection, if so, did the House's impeachment of him, and Senate's acquittal of him, not constitute Congress' having held him accountable? It wouldn't shock me if SCOTUS agreed with Trump.",

The Conservative Partnership Institute, run in part by Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Sen. Jim Demint, and America Legal First, founded by his immigration adviser Stephen Miller, are also partners.\r\n\r\nThe Biden campaign on Friday quickly dismissed Trump\u2019s attempts to keep Project 2025 at arm\u2019s length.\r\n\r\nThe Trump campaign has previously pushed back on reports about plans Trump\u2019s allies are looking to implement if Trump wins reelection.

    "Ashley Etienne is addressing some of the real issues of  the Democratic Party that loses Black voters.\n\nOne situation that is left unspoken by all three of you is critical; A large Black audience was cheering Donald Trump loudly at every turn.\n\nThe Democratic Party and Joe Biden in particular need to address this head on.\n\nAshley spoke to real statistically verifiable and significant improvements in the lives of Black Americans as a result of the Biden Presidency.\n\nUnless Mr Biden is willing to hit the road and speak to Black organizations at a large meeting, the probability of him making real headway in foiling Trumps lies are slim.\n\nHe needs to be out there, live and in person. Televised appearances and ads don\u2019t cut it and never will. He needs to assign Kamala Harris to headline at her own sets of such events.\n\nI hope that some of you effective and recognized Black journalists find a way to persuade the Democratic Party and our president to organize meetings of Black American organizations and speak directly to them with demonstration of real evidence.\n\nMany of us across the country are extremely frustrated with a lot of things in our society and the world. The situation makes it all too easy for charming con men to lead people to believe what they hear, regardless of how groundless what they are being told is.\n\nI think we were  seeing that at that meeting with Trump..\n\nA few days ago, Tom Suozzi went out the door and spoke in person to people about his stand on immigration head on.\n\nHe won by a large margin.\n\nThere needs to be much more of that by the President and Vice President.\n\nAnd not just with Black people either. I think of young people; Palestinians; people of various Latin cultures; Cubans in particular.\n\nMr. Biden has seen his numbers drop in those and other groups as well.",

    "The \u041c\u0435tsamor Nuclear Power Plant in Armenia was chosen as the most dangerous reactor in the world due to its design in the 1960s. The nuclear reactor should have been shut down a long time ago. Because it spreads radiation to Europe and other continents. Radioactive and chemical wastes of the NucIear Power Plant enter the \u0421\u0430spian Sea through rivers and then into the oceans through other rivers. The NPP is located in a seismic country and a strong earthquake can o\u0107cur at any time. Armenia should be sanctioned and embargoed to close this reactor. This environmental terrorism must be stopped. The number of cancer patients in the world is increasing rapidly due to nuclear power plants. The \u0410rmenian government, which is a military-econ\u043emic ally of the invading Russia and receives financial and military support from it, should think about the health of the peoples of Europe. The Prime Minister of Japan said that the chemical and radioactive waste of nuclear power plants in Japan will be discharged into the ocean. As a result of water circulation and rainfall, plants will absorb toxic water. There will be radiation in drinking water and cancer patients will increase.

    "Dmitry Peskov's personal and business life intertwines with his political career. He is known for his close ties to Vladimir Putin, which have been both professionally advantageous and subject to scrutiny.\n\nIn terms of his personal life, Peskov has been married multiple times. His most notable marriage was to Tatiana Navka, a famous Russian ice dancer and Olympic gold medalist. They divorced in 2015, amid rumors of infidelity on Peskov's part. This high-profile split attracted considerable media attention in Russia.\n\nAs for controversies, Peskov has been at the center of several scandals during his tenure as Putin's Press Secretary. One notable incident occurred in 2016 when he was photographed wearing an expensive watch, sparking accusations of corruption and lavish spending. Peskov defended himself by claiming the watch was a gift and eventually had to publicly declare his assets to dispel the allegations.\n\nAdditionally, Peskov's role in shaping Russia's media landscape and managing information has drawn criticism from international observers who accuse the Russian government of censorship and propaganda. He has been instrumental in controlling the narrative around sensitive issues such as the annexation of Crimea, the conflict in Ukraine, and Russia's involvement in Syria.\n\nDespite these controversies, Peskov remained a trusted confidant of Putin and a key figure in Russian politics until his retirement from the position in 2024. Throughout his career, he navigated the complex intersection of power, media, and public perception in Putin's Russia, leaving a lasting imprint on the country's political landscape.",

    "Dear friends, I am trying to build a new movement with the most progressive and revolutionary and low-income sectors of the nation (maybe it is too utopian), but maybe it can evolve into an alternative political option in the near future with the main objective of saving the United States of America Republic of George Washington, it will be called \u201cThe Patriotic Board of Salvation\u201d or \u201cThe Patriotic Council of Salvation\u201d:\r\n\r\nThe Patriotic Board of Salvation\r\n\r\nIn the face of a broken and destroyed United States of America, we need to recover the ability to see and interpret the American reality from a nationalist, independent and sovereign perspective, but without abandoning the passport of universal citizens. We need to get rid of colonial visions, including those of critical thought but still trapped in Eurocentric magnifying glasses and canons, making it, for this reason, impossible to accept, since it does not appear in the manual, or was not said by any Western authority, that the American people can and have the right to forge a second Patriotic Board, and a second independence. but this time an independence from the European Oligarchs, (the 1% ruling class), from foreing capitalist imperialist investors, and from the zionist oligarchic state of Israel, to build the foundations of a future Workers-Republic of free and associated workers and producers to satisfy with the result of their work the needs democratically planned by the whole of society.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are convinced that after the constitutional violation carried out by The Democratic Party and The Republican Party by violating the democratic bases of the people\u2019s rule of law, it remains that of all the options, this one, of organizing a Patriotic Board of Salvation, is the most economical in effort and sacrifice that the American people can forge to recover their dignity and freedom. Life tells us that history is spiraling anew. And that the real engine that moves history in United States has been, and will continue to be, the struggle for power between the slave-owning oligarchs, today metamorphosed into exploiting capitalists, and on the other hand, yesterday the slaves, today the impoverished working class of the nation .\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s ponder, on the one hand, the thickest aspects of the dangerous and insecure world situation that come to enhance the possibility of the emergence of a Patriotic Board in United States as a in United States as a response to the hegemonic crisis that the Republic is experiencing. Indeed, there can be no serious analysis, made with dialectical logic, that ignores the fact that the political crisis of the US Imperialist system of domination, today administered by The Democratic Party and The Republican party, is connected, with its particular sinuosities, to the crisis of the capitalist world system led by U.S. Oligarchic and European Oligarchic classes\r\n\r\nAnd what stands out most prominently today in international relations is a military escalation, which leads to the assumption, based on what the historical record demonstrates, that the imperial system of capital, which has the United States as its hegemon, is developing in seeking, once again, to resolve its structural crisis by way of another world conflagration. We return to the term imperialism understood as an articulated global system, since it seems to us that it is a more precise and adequate definition to describe the current international scenario of plundering of resources from the periphery, armed confrontation with any manifestation of popular revolutions and rivalries between the powers for the primacy and distribution of the world\u2019s resources. And in this context, it can be observed that we are facing the failure of the North American arms model of production in a multipolar context in which there are other actors disputing supremacy and some located at the antipodes of NATO, for example, China and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe structural shortcomings that U.S. imperialist Oligarchic class suffers today cannot be overcome with its international military actions committed through NATO. The long depression that the capitalist economy is going through, despite the immense amount of money they have spent to save the system, has not stopped their crisis, but rather aggravated it. All this must be analyzed with a multifocal gaze, because this is a crisis that is leaking everywhere, a cracking of the entire civilization, it is a multi-headed hydra that devours itself. According to these appraisals, it can be said that we are in the presence of a new chronic crisis of capitalism in its global financial monopoly stage, of very severe periodic turbulences that always fertilise the ground for revolutionary popular movements to emerge with alternative proposals.\r\n\r\nLet us now slide the focus of the analysis to the other side of the coin, to evaluate the United States domestic local scenario, and it does not take long for a burning soup to appear before our eyes where the antagonistic contradictions that gravitate over the general American society and that have ended up eroding the political hegemony of Democrats and Republicans are cooked, which also contributes to facilitating the paving for a possible approach of a Patriotic Board with the main objective of saving The Republic as a desired mechanism because of the need for the American working class and their families to overcome this disaster to which they are subjected.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, it is understandable that when the betrayal of the original US Founders revolution and the consequent abandonment of the US constitution and Bill of Rightswere consummated, replacing it with a program of neoliberal adjustments, to openly favor the accumulation of wealth of the businessmen organized in the union of the exploiters, multinational corporations, an accelerated impoverishment and dismantling of the constitutional rights of the American people ensued. All the social conquests that had been achieved were destroyed. Consequently, this social and economic destruction is automatically leading to the destruction of the political support of The Republican Party and The Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nIf we review the factors that have been present in the electoral show on a case-by-case basis, we will realize that they are briefcase parties, which for the most part do not have an organized and rooted militancy in the communities, still has the state under control. The others are only serving as \u201cdemocratic backdrops\u201d of an authoritarian and unconstitutional government,\r\n\r\nThe only recourse they have to use is to violate the political rights of the American people to prevent the participation of an option that emerges from 90% of the US population people, because there is a new majority.\r\n\r\nIt is at that moment that the Patriotic Board of Salvation could appear as a political space for the articulation of the different nationalist, patriotic and revolutionary social forces that feel that The Republicans and Democrats hurts them, and that wish to contribute to the construction of a decent and dignified Republic.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, the mission of this Patriotic Board is to establish an agenda to decouple the American economy from neoliberalism and the dictates of the global financial system, and it can be achieved. An agenda that exercises an independent and sovereign policy that aims to recover sufficient levels of equality so that the American people can live with dignity and tranquility. In this line of thought, we propose that the Patriotic Board develop five main lines of action: 1) recovery of the Auto industry, 2) promotion of agro-industrial development, 3) modernization of rural life and the peasant family economy, 4) recovery of the public health system, and 5) development of the public education system.\r\n\r\nIn short, the American people are living in two crises at the same time, one that is unfolding at the global level, the general crisis of the imperial capital, the other, local, that bites and spreads throughout the whole United States as a result of the hegemonic collapse of the bi-party dictatorship as a subaltern engravation of capitalism. However, the good news is that in crises alternatives are forged and the people of George Washington have one that they wield every time they perceive a new opportunity to free themselves, the opportunity is now to call for the organization of a Patriotic Board to build a second Republic but this time a Republic for the workers.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON, THOMAS JEFFERSON, JAMES MADISON, JOHN ADAMS, ALEXANDER HAMILTON, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, THOMAS PAINE, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, MALCOLM X, HUEY NEWTON, FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, CAESAR CHAVEZ, MARTIN LUTHER KING AND JOHN F.

    "Biden's debate was not a bad debate it was a horrific mental freeze. it was 10 times worse than any other bad Presidential debate performance in history. Then one week later in a mellow ABC interview he answered Did you watch the debate replay? with, \" I don't know if I watched it\" not yes or no or even I don't recall for a cataclysmic event that was one week prior?? BUT actually the real proof of his cognition decline is that even before the debate he was losing in the polls to Trump who has so many serious attackable faults, Biden should be ahead by over 10 points if he were competent. But for months now we pretty much knew Biden was declining with dementia. Biden, his advisors and family should have decided not to run a year ago. His advisors should have not had him debate Trump or make any unscripted appearances going forward. I don't care how bad it looks, I don't care if they have to make AI videos of Biden to do a massive coverup at this point they just have to keep him under wraps even if its for 4 more years. I think Kamala Harris could beat Trump with full backing from the Democratic party. She's a woman, its the year of the woman. Biden's best move would be to resign that would make a faster and smoother transition to Harris with all the current cabinet and top advisors staying the same, they are running the country now anyway and in the long run it wouldn't deter from Biden's legacy any more than stepping down later or imploding terribly later.",

David Pecker, head of the National Enquirer, played a pivotal role in securing Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 Presidential victory through a relentless media blitz. This campaign flooded key battleground states\u2014Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania\u2014with pro-Trump content, generating between 0.64 billion to 1.92 billion impressions. Trump\u2019s face was everywhere\u2014gas stations, convenience stores, grocery stores, and dollar stores\u2014making his message inescapable.\n\nPecker\u2019s strategy was akin to a 24/7 infomercial, relentlessly portraying Trump as a business savior while burying damaging stories. This constant media barrage manipulated voter perceptions, securing Trump\u2019s narrow victories in these critical states.\n\nNow, Trump has been convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. These charges are tied to the intent to commit or conceal other crimes, including campaign finance violations. Had the truth come out\u2014right after the Billy Bush tapes where Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women\u2014his campaign would have collapsed, and the RNC would have scrambled for a replacement.\n\nPecker didn\u2019t just help Trump win; he entrenched the MAGA movement by targeting uneducated voters susceptible to tabloid trash. This indoctrination turned Trump\u2019s base into a cult-like following, immune to negative revelations.\n\nTrump\u2019s conviction exposes the catastrophic impact of media manipulation on our political system. This is a call to action. We must enact stringent regulations to ensure transparency and protect democratic values. Our electoral process must remain fair and untainted by orchestrated media influence. We must safeguard our democracy now.\n\nThe time for complacency is over.

And she did nothing for America. All her positions were to hinder the recommendations of those giving the position. She was never elected to the position. She was always appointed and the saying that goes by her name is that there are prostitutes who lie for money and there are prostitutes for positions. She was able to get a position as a general sinker not because she was good and suitable but as a payment to be paid. In the appointment, also as a smoker of hashish and marijuana, she made sure that smokers like her were judged and even got worse with them instead of being judged in front of those who demanded severe punishments and her mind is hollow and empty and her stupid laugh is to cover her stupidity. Do you see such a woman as the president of the United States, I don't.

    "This is a very fluid scenario, with  amazing hypothetical what ifs --- the danger of these spins is that the negligence of the terrorist group, Islamic Revolutionary Guard may force them to escalate the war to cover up a scenario that maybe, the assasin is a loyalist of the late Iranian President. Terrorists never owned their mistakes --- it is convenient to blame Israel because of the escalating costs to Iran since they fired 300+ missiles into Israel. Iran violated Jordanian airspace. Cyprus NATO planes and Israel's Iron Dome intercepted the missiles, reducing damage to Israeli targets. In turn, Israel's retaliation targeting the city with nuclear power plant capability set back Iran's energy security. The accidental death of the Iranian President is believed to be an assassination. However, it was met with rejoicing by his critics. Iran is close to a civil war, and focusing attention on the former Hamas PM's assassination is a Misdirection that can potentially erupt into a civil war if local Iranians are involved.\nMeanwhile, US military ships set sail from the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea, to be able to respond quickly to a major fallout from this high pitched rhetoric.\nThe scenario is Dante's Inferno.\n\nThe social media should sift the facts from the spins ---",

    "glory to are lord an savior. thank you for spending your time reading this. Jesus Christ are lord and savior and son of god is returning soon, an if you want to be rapture ready, its pretty simple. 1. believe that Jesus died on the cross and spilled his own blood for are sins, was buried and rose on the third day from the dead in glory. 2. admit your a sinner and your need him to save you. 3. repent your sins on him and his blood and in faith and trust and believe in him to save you. also try in these last days to walk like christ, if you messed up or sin, don panic for your sins are payed by his blood. past, present, and future sins. his morals and ways are greater then are own and i asks you seek not sinning as possible to show god you care about him. his blood cleans you and forgives you of sins. Because as Scripture say. there be people left behind to face gods wraith and face the mark of the beast. were a person will have it on there right hand or forehead. it will be the only way to buy and sell anything. taking this mark is a unforgivable sin and forever dam to the second death. So if you stay behind don\u2019t take the mark stay in faith to Jesus an resist cause they will chop your head off, let it happen if captured. For this time will be hell on earth. Lucifer will force you to take it. Do not accept it choose death. i pray you and many get saved and my fellow christians spread the word. Jesus loves us and nothing can separate us from him and faith and grace gets us saved. salvation and eternal life is a free gift from god nothing we earned or gained. Please it is important to spread this message to many. Jesus is your only way to avoid it. the signs are showing, more disasters and wars and suffering has increase dramatically. i pray to all see the true and believe.this is serious we may go any day now. The eclipse on April the 8th is last warning an thens are gonna get worst, soon even you will say \"ok thats not normal\". ask an he will help you. An keep your bibles safe they will guide you in grand tribulation and lucifer will try to destroy them. once we leve there be ww3, attacks on Israel and must of major powers destroyed. For there be 21 wraiths on this earth that will make earth be hell on earth and most of the population would be dead so preparers you will not survived nor win against Lucifer. also there be two witnesses who will preach the news for the first half of the tribulation, kill by lucifer and resurrected on the third day and rise back to heaven. there be disasters and plagues like rivers an oceans to blood, water turning bitter/poisonous and leads to some to death by wormwood astroid, scorpion with human like face and crowns will give those who have not accepted christ agonisy pain an people wont die when this plague happen for five months. scorch earth on the sun burns up earth, earthquakes tsunamis, will come on the earth and you be a hellish time to those left behind. an people who take the mark with have the worst punishing in the tribulation. At the end of the 7 year tribulation repeat at the end not during the tribulation. Jesus on his white horse wearing a white robes with garment in red saying lord of lords, king of kings and his saints (us christian who died and raptured) will charge and deaft Lucifer, his followers and unbelievers and he will be cast back to the pit and Jesus will rule us for 1000 year. then Lucifer will try again and god will stop him for good and he and his follower and people who are not in the lambs book will be cast into lake of fire/second death. then the new Jerusalem, earth, and heaven will come and god will dwell in us forever with no sin, pain, evil, suffer are all gone. You can be part of this if you trust in jesus is blood and accept what he did. so do not fear for jesus is with you if you believe what he did an his blood and claim him as your lord an savior. if you do this he will come to get you out of here and skip the 7 year tribulation.",

    "I can understand and respect being a Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, or even an Independent. I also support the First Amendment to the fullest. However, as a political journalist, you should be reporting all areas and investigating in the trenches. What this channel reports are opinions and biased words. I've scrolled this channel and see nothing about any of the many things Biden has done. Afghanistan pull out, or Biden's spiraling decline with diminished mental faculties. Being truthful I say this with utmost respect. I do not like Trump, his tweets, or his ongoing me, me, my attitude. However, you would have to be a very biased individual to not see what is happening to this man. I must admit, he has placed himself in some of these situations and no one is above any law. My problem is that all these charges he is being charged with in multiple states are simply disgusting. This man has been out of office for three years and right at the time he announces his candidacy, all these charges come out against him. The writing is on the wall. How can't anyone not see this? How can anyone not see this to be an attack against someone that one side dislikes and is doing everything in their power to prevent them from being in a position they don't want him in. Yes, Trump is disgusting, mean, a bully and so, on. However, he does not deserve these attacks at this time. This should have been done a year after he was out of office, period! If he is guilty of any of these things, wait until after the elections, if he isn't elected, then charge him, or after he serves 4 years if elected. The people have a right to vote who they want. I've voted and have not always got the person I've voted for. All presidents are disliked by some, liked by some, do bad things, have certain agendas, and at times puppets and don't exactly serve the people. Most in history have drank from the same cup, but, they are there because they were elected by either popular votes or college electoral. Bush just barely beat Gore and that was a fiasco, but the one thing Gore had, that Trump didn't, was class. He conceded and moved on. The bottom line is, that Trump has a right to be in this election to let the people decide. Not to be railroaded by head hunters who had their chance for three years before charge, but didn't and waited until it fit their overall agenda. The reporting on this channel is too easy. How about diving deep and really doing some investigative reporting based on facts. Not things that are easy to cover, like your opinions on a guy who a certain amount of people don't like. Be fair and unbiased and start reporting about Biden's decline or how Harris has no substance, other than to laugh at every important question she is given. Honestly guys, report on these things, no matter the party, or affiliate. I'd like to see something intelligent coming from either Biden, Harris or any viable candidate has to say. If there is no intelligence, then dissect that and ask these important questions on how these types of people can hold such a high office. Just so you know, I will vote for anyone who is the right person. Male or female. Obama, Busch, Reagan, Clinton (Bill/Hillary, Biden or Trump. I just want the right person to be a leader who stops bashing others and talks about policy, unity, and the American way. Truth, Justice, and empowering our great nation, called America! To be honest, I will really be surprised if you read all this or even respond. At least I said my peace. Have a good day!",

    "NDAs (non disclosure agreements) are legal in all fifty states.  So, what was the crime?  Name it, please. Only with mind numbed liberal goats hand picked to form a lynch mob jury in Manhattan, could such a blind injustice of the American legal system occur.  Already past the statute of limitations for a crime that was never named in the indictment, and a crime that never ever even occurred, along with an unconstitutional prosecution of a political opponent, seeking to find a crime for a man, after he is arrested for those same unnamed crimes, we have a political circus act. Attorney fees are daily and continually used by thousands of people as legitimate itemized deductible expenses. \"In general, attorney fees are deductible when incurred relating to profit or loss for a business. For example, the cost of hiring a lawyer to defend a patent or negotiate a contract is a deductible attorney fee, since these expenses are ordinary and necessary for the production of income.\"   IRS rules, 1040 deductions.\r\nIn general, legal fees that are related to your business, including rental properties, can be deductions. This is true even if you didn't win the legal case in which the legal fees were incurred.  IRS Rules, itemized 1040 deductions.  Trump, or Cohen, whatever the case may be, negotiated a contract with Stormy Daniels.  It was a legal contract.  In someone's opinion, it effected the profit and or loss of a business.  NDAs (non disclosure agreements) are perfectly legal in all fifty states and territories of the United States of America.  Whether or not the NDA affected an election, or not, was negated by the fact that the attorney fees were dated after the 2016  election, not before, but as it turned out the Stormy Daniels allegations in fact DID NOT effect the election, because she broke the NDA agreement prior to the election, and Trump still won anyway.  In fact, virtually everyone that voted for either Trump or Hillary Clinton already knew about the Stormy Daniels accusations prior to the election.  The Stormy Daniels disclosures were not a factor that influenced many votes, and the Manhattan court has no jurisdiction in determining federal elections anyway.",

    "Since when is Hamas a terrorist organisation? It is the government and army of the OCCUPIED TERRITORY OF GAZA. It has the right to seek its liberation by any means including by force. This is in the Geneva Convention with the right of people to self determination, which Israel is denying Palestinians. Israel is an illegal state created by terrorist attack, killing and forcing 700,000 people to emigrate under threat of extermination, and destruction of villages to erase any trace of original inhabitants: a genocide. Israel has no right of self defense. It only has the right to protect its children and old people (the rest are army or reservists, including wome). Furthermore, Hamas carried out a RAID AGAINST 3 MILITARY BASES controling Gaza under 24/7 surveillance. They are not civilians. They are armed military and police, hiding amongst the civilians, with bunkers, safe rooms and other means of occupation. Israel is a colonial power who have carried out illegal killings, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, humanitarian violations, arrest without charge and jailing without trial. What is there in Israel that remotely resembles \"democracy\" and rule of law or international human rights for Palestinians? Nothing. So could we stop calling Hamas terrorists. Their attack on 7 October was directed at military and police. Many civilian deaths, such as bombing  and missiles from tanks and helicopters firing on houses and cars escaping from the unexpected Rave Party, were caused by the IDF or in crossfire. There were no atrocities, babies slaughtered or women raped. These are lies that have been debunked. Israel has not conducted an investigation of HOW the 1200 people were killed or HOW MANY were military or police. But it is clear that around 40,000 civilian Palestinians have been slaughtered indiscriminately by the IDF, including at least 13,000 children, on top of the total illegal destruction of all infrastructures and homes. Israel is guilty of war crimes and genocide, on top of the crimes of apartheid and ethnic cleansing since 1948. Let's be clear and honest. The US is of course guilty of supporting the genocide.",

He's never actually invented any of these things, he's just bought into them at the right time. The idea that he's this genius GOD - like figure that is revolutionizing the planet is just total nonsense. He has a degree in Economics, not engineering. He's a businessman, not an inventor. \n    Although he's clearly very intelligent and has worked very hard to get where he's at, he didn't \"come from nothing\" and I'd take everything he says with a pinch of salt. His millionaire parents helped founder his wealth, and he has taken all the credit for companies such as Tesla, which he had little to do with until 2008, 5 years after its invention, when the income he made from Paypal (also invented by others) helped him buy out enough shares to promote him to CEO. \n   He's the greatest showman on earth, and the only reason he is the \"richest\" man on earth is due to his stake in Tesla. Most car companies in history have gone bankrupt at some point, and when that happens to Tesla (and it almost has several times) his wealth will depreciate by an astronomical amount, as he has no liquidity cash, often selling his own shares to keep other projects above water, which is never a good sign from an investors standpoint",

Look at what happened in Pakistan, there was a massive destruction of churches and NOBODY talks about that. What about the Christians in NIgeria? What about the French professor BEHEADED in FRANCE? What would CAUSE a Buddhist to slaughter Muslims if there wasn't some kind of provocation from Muslims? What about the slaves who built the Qatari stadium, and can't even go back home unless they are DEAD? What about the Islamic terroist attacks that has happened in Europe and USA? People forget easy. ANy religion doesn't have to make make the CONSTANT claim that it's peaceful unless there is SOMETHING wrong with it. For people who want to understand this I suggest you look into the history of Islam and how its ROOTS do NOT match with the core values and principles of Judaism and Christianity:\n1) Cira International (Al-Fadi is an ex-muslim from Saudi Arabia and gives you all the tidbits imams and other extremeislamic radicals don't want you to know)\n2) Apostate Prophet (a Turkish ex-muslim who knows the Quran front and back and makes comparison videos of other regions versus Islam. Mind you, he is an Atheist if that makes you comfortable to know, so you'll be getting unbiased information.)\n3) To understand the Quran, one needs to visualize it. Look up Nabi Asli and he has plenty of animated videos to show what was going on at a particular event in the Quran. \n4) The people in Islam are the victims to this communist-political group (it's only disguised as a religion). They suffer the brunt that Islam offers. It's not a religion of peace, there is nothing peaceful about Muhammad nor anything \"holy\" about him since he consumates marriage with a nine-year old girl and kills, steals and destroys flourishing Jewish communities who once thrived in Saudi Arabia. And slaughters anyone else who is not a Muslim, and if he is generous enough he'll allow the jizyah tax. No church can or synagogue can be higher than a mosque. Once the jizyah tax is erdicated, you're done for. Look at the information, then you will understand why Islam is the way it is in Pakistan, Afghanistan and including the \"rich\" countries who in fact wouldn't have been where they are now because of the oil.\n\nAnd if that's still NOT convincing, take it from ex-muslims who've had to suffer from freidns and family who want them KILLED.

It\u2019s equally easy to imagine Putin staging a false flag attack and blaming it on Ukraine to shore up support for the war permit him more movement in Ukraine. The danger with this one is the Russian people being so shocked by the breach of national security they lose faith in Putin as leader. If I had to bet on one, it would be a disgruntled ISIS.

Especially being in the information age where people can be plugged into every campaign stop and every move made by the candidates instantaneously. Of course they can get to know a candidate in three months. Other countries have election cycles exactly that long (smaller countries, be it, but still). If a candidate died a party would be forced to replace them. It's not impossible. And it's not too late. The convention is halfway through August, so I wouldn't wait until then to begin the process, but if Biden were to step down in the first half of July, the candidates vying to replace him would have enough time to introduce themselves to the nation.

(I give dummy-crats an education).\r\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is prosecuting former President Donald Trump for unlawful federal political contributions and the subsequent concealment of those contributions. However, it is the ''Federal'' Election Commission, NOT the Manhattan DA, that is charged by Congress with enforcing ''federal'' campaign laws. \r\n\r\nBy taking ''federal'' law into his own hands, Bragg is way out of order! What\u2019s more, he has run afoul of a somewhat obscure but vital doctrine created by the Supreme Court specifically to prevent such prosecutorial overreach.\r\n\r\nThis rule, known as the \u201cprimary jurisdiction doctrine,\u201d says that a court should stay or dismiss a claim when it implicates issues within the special competence of a ''federal'' administrative agency. In this case, ''federal'' campaign finance violations are within the special competence of the FEC, NOT the Manhattan DA. Thus, the right thing to do is for Bragg to defer to the federal government on statutes it enforces.\r\n\r\nNew York statute requires that the predicate, the underlying crime, must also be a ''New York'' crime, not a crime in another jurisdiction. So by Bragg bringing a crime that ''allegedly'' was against the ''federal elections commissions'', he's dealing with a case ''outside'' of his jurisdiction! FBI already looked at this case years ago and did not want to touch it. They said there IS NO case and left it alone!",

    "The sportsball kicker is a self-righteous, religious ignoramus.  God regards religion as nothing but filthy rags.  According to God, the most diabolical lie told to humans was, \"God knows that if you eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil your eyes will be opened and you will be as gods.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the first man Adam disobeyed God, he, like Harrison Butker, Blamed the Woman, Blamed God for making Her, then Blamed the Woman again.  \r\n\r\nWhat  Adam should have done for his bride Eve, is what Jesus--the Word of God made flesh--did for His bride (His church--Not the Catholic church): that is:  take all the punishment and judgment for His bride's sin on Himself.  Had Adam done this, God would have slain Adam then raised him up again.  And sin would not have entered the world.  Because it is the sperm (from the male, obviously) which makes blood form in the ovum.  The life of the flesh is in the blood.  Human blood is sinful from Adam having disobeyed God's Word and eaten the forbidden fruit.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Lord Jesus had to be born of a virgin, via the Holy Spirit--not the sperm.  As such, Jesus's human body was sinless.\r\n\r\nUnlike Adam, Jesus loves His bride (His followers, Not the Catholic church).  \r\nAlso, no one \"killed\" Jesus.  Jesus planned to go to the cross before He made the foundation of the world.  He did die on the cross, but he Rose from the Dead!  Jesus is now  back on His heavenly throne clothed in majesty. \r\n\r\nIt is Jesus who builds His church--Not the Catholics.  His church is made of single moms, single women and single men who have dedicated themselves to Him.  As such, God gives those people names higher than that of sons and daughters.  Jesus' church also encompasses the lowliest, un-named followers in Nepal, the underground churches in Iran and Nigeria; the Messianic Jews the world over; the single mom in Iowa who loves the Lord Jesus; the repentant homosexual in Florida; the struggling alcoholic who trusts Jesus for his salvation.  The Lord's church is Not made up of self-righteous religious.  All that is as filthy rags to God.\r\n\r\nSo, instead of blaming women, denigrating woman, men need to SUBMIT TO THE LORD JESUS TOTALLY.  THEN, IF THEY MARRY, THEY MUST SERVE AND SACRIFIECE FOR THEIR WIVES THE WAY THE LORD DOES FOR HIS CHURCH.  But first, that requires them to be Born Again.  \r\n\r\nBeing a super religious, self-righteous sportsball kicker  will not get you into the Kingdom of God.  It will get you thrown bodily into the Lake of Fire which burns for all eternity.\r\n\r\nDon't listen to sportsball kickers.  Don't listen to the satanic Catholic \"church.\"   Listen to the Lord Jesus.  Read the Bible.",

    "The Beznau nuclear power plant in Switzerland, \u041c\u0435tsamor Plant in Armenia and Fessenheim Plant in France was chosen as the most dangerous reactors in the world due to its design in the 1960s and 1970s.

Radioactive and chemical wastes of the \u041c\u0435tsamor NucIear Power Plant enter the \u0421\u0430spian Sea through rivers and then into the oceans through other rivers. The NPP is located in a seismic country and a strong earthquake can o\u0107cur at any time. Armenia should be sanctioned and embargoed to close this reactor.

The \u0410rmenian government, which is a military-econ\u043emic ally of the invading Russia and receives financial and military support from it, should think about the health of the peoples of Europe.

As a result of water circulation and rainfall, plants will absorb toxic water. There will be radiation in drinking water and cancer patients will increase.

After stating that he could do so now and in 3 years' time, his long rambling answer went on at length about how he wasn't prepared to sit down with Putin due to his behaviour, repeating this several times, only immediately to say that he would sit down with Putin, like he had recently about arms control, but that was pointless, as it went nowhere. And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, was supposedly amongst the stronger parts of this performance. The whole world should not have to be sitting on the edge of their seats to see whether the President of the United States will be able successfully to reach the end of his sentences. Joe Biden is an incredible man and has done his country a wonderful service. But it really is time to step down now.",

Donald J Trump, didn\u2019t they bring a guy in he was convicted stories lying spent two years in prison. This is who they their whole thing now if this would\u2019ve been an even courtroom, I do believe the defense is witnesses would\u2019ve been able to give what they know about this case this judge did not want it in his court room close the court room down argued with people told him he didn\u2019t like them rolling their eyes.

    "There was a reason Biden's own team had been hiding him in the basement. But CNN has been part of the making of this scenario, as have the many of the legacy media corporations. Jon Stewart has been pointing it out for months. And young progressives have been for more than three years. The 2020 Primary changed everything for so many. Never before have we seen the number 2 and 3 ranked candidates drop out to endorse the number 4 candidate to rally against the number 1 ranked candidate...two days before Super Tuesday, due to one endorsement and the results of one red state that we were never going to win anyway. Most of Biden's primary voters in 2020 on that Super Tuesday even admitted to pollsters at the time that they didn't decide on him until the last 48 hours before they voted. It was election meddling and voter manipulation at the highest level, conducted by a handful of elites in a very undemocratic and outdated primary process. And we are still suffering the consequences still. I voted for Biden in the general, but many other Bernie/Warren/Yang voters didn't. Fast forward and the unreliable youth vote who normally would age into reliably left leaning young adults largely checked out. The whole narrative that Biden was the \"safest\" choice then was never pushed back on responsibly by corporate media. He was the riskiest, as he is now. I was no fan of Harris either, but bro picked her as a running mate...it's time to back that decision and give her a chance.",

Incoming PM visits Buckingham Palace by midday to be officially asked to form a new Government by the monarch (a ceremonial thing really), which takes about 30 minutes, and then moves into 10 Downing Street with their family by about 1pm where they immediately start work as the new Prime Minister.

    "i'm afraid that Mr. Sanders, in an effort to put the best possible construction on the motives of many in his 'base',  has escaped some distance from reality.\n\nThe endless chanting of 'intifada' and 'from the river to the sea', unless interpreted as the \nmimicy of unreasoning parrots (and to some extent it is just that).\nis NOTHING LESS tha glorification of violence in the name of 'palestinian liberation'.\n\nIt is, effectively, endorisement of terrorism and complete failure to acknowledge the pain and suffering inflicted upon Israeli citizens, many of them 'peaceniks' pursuing good relations with their Palestinian neighbors, on Oct. 7th of last year.\n\nIt is also abject failure to recognize the essentially conservative, reactionary nture of Palestinian-Arab nationalism over the past 100 years,  particularly as expressed by the likes of Hamas.  The misogymistic and perhaps homophobic aspect opf islamim and its predilection for dictatorship ought to trpuble those who recognize themselves as beneficiaries of the Western liberal order.\n\nBut many who showed sympathy for the Communist side during the Vietnam era were similarly deceived.  While demanding freedom for themselves, they probably disregarded the lacl pof freedom which characterized sll Communist dictatorships.\n\nI am not suggesting however, that the Vietnam war was a wise undertaking on the part of the US government, becausw the conditions for victory simply didm not exist.\n\nNor do I maintain that, under present circumstances, total israeli victory over Hamas is an outcome which anyone can realistically expect.  However I would regard iit as a desirable outcome, partly because Hamas' governsance of Gaza has been so disastrous for the population. None of Israel's sins absolve Palestinian authorities of their own sins.\n\nNever forget:  Hamas precipitated this war, after two years of planning.  One may blame israeli intelligence failure as well, of one likes.  Israel was not prepared.\n\nNever forget that it was the Arab sdide which precipitated the 'naqba' (disaster) of 1948, through their own malicious but failed attempt to 'drive the Jews into the sea'.  \nAs we see, they have learned nothing in 75 years.  \nHow will a two-state solution work if many Arabs really want one state, an exclusively Arab one?\n\nNever forget that palestine as a rwgion is the original homeland of the Jews.  \nIndeed twoand a half of the twelve tribes of Israel were allotted territory east of the Jordan River!\nIn the 1st century A.D. as most educated people know, Jesus and His disciples performed their ministry for the most part in what we call the West Bank today.\n\nAt no time did God revoke His territorial promises to Israel for eternity.  Therefore the astonishing revival of Jewish life in Palestine from the late 19th century until now was not an 'accident' of history, nor a 'mistake', nor an 'aberration nor the result of some cleverly concocted conspiracy.\nEven before there was an organized Zionist movement, there were 'Christian Zionists' who perceived the direction which history would take, by reading Bib lical prophecy.\n\n\nThis is not to justify what Jews do or the State of Israel does.  But to analyze the present situation in purely secular terms, with only recent events in mind, simplty will not do.\nThis conflict has been millennia in the making, and there is no political solution whene\n the love of God is absent.",

    "A lot of people who worked with Diddy witnessed/ heard/ participated in with regard to Diddy. But, yet those individuals turned a blind eye and said nothing. I'm not surprised by anything having to do with Diddy. I never doubted Cassie nor did i see her lawsuit as a money grab. You are allowed to sue civilly if one is injured regardless of who the defendant is. This video just gives a visual of what exactly this women went through on a regular. The idea that one would question why she stayed or went back multiple times as it takes 7 times for a domestic violence victim to leave for good. Diddy stated he was in therapy( it takes at least 6 to 18 months for the alleged abuser to understand there behavior/ why they are doing it/ anger issues/ diagnosis of mental health if one is needed). There is no 30 to 45 day peogram for men or women who abuse partners/ children/spouse/ friends/ family or others. Diddy claimed he went to rehab, but according to the mule the alleged substance illegal were for Diddy.  Again substance abuse is not a 1 size fits all. The old outdated science behind a 30 day program no longer exists. Science now says the average substance user needs between 90 to 120 days and after care ti maintain sobriety. Its clear Diddy has a problem. As a survior of domestic violence,  people often ask why did you stay so long. When you are constantly threatened with physical/ emotional/ mental violence it breaks you down to the core of your soul. When you seek out a restraining order and the person continues to violate it, speaks volumes of one's fear for themselves and that of there children. Yes, in part you do think its going to get better and yes in part you do blame yourself for the actions of the person.  But, i finally left when the fear of staying was less importantly that fear of leaving.  I left like Cassie when I decided that whatever happens will happen even if that meant more violence or loss of my life. Like Cassie,  i left when i regained my power to decide no longer will this continue.",

    "BREAKING NEWS-  \nDEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO CRY - \r\n\r\n Liz Cheney And The January 6 Committee Suppressed Exonerating Evidence Of Trump\u2019s Push For National Guard\r\n\r\nCheney and her committee falsely claimed they had \u2018no evidence\u2019 to support Trump officials\u2019 claims the White House had asked for 10,000 to 20,000 National Guard troops.\r\n\r\n    Former Rep. Liz Cheney\u2019s January 6 Committee suppressed evidence that President Donald Trump pushed for 10,000 to 20,000 National Guard troops to protect the nation\u2019s capital, a previously hidden transcript obtained by The Federalist shows.\r\n\r\nCheney and her committee falsely claimed they had \u201cno evidence\u201d to support Trump officials\u2019 claims the White House had communicated its desire for 10,000 to 20,000 National Guard troops. In fact, an early transcribed interview conducted by the committee included precisely that evidence from a key source. The interview, which Cheney attended and personally participated in, was suppressed from public release until now.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy Chief of Staff Anthony Ornato\u2019s first transcribed interview with the committee was conducted on January 28, 2022. In it, he told Cheney and her investigators that he overheard White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows push Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to request as many National Guard troops as she needed to protect the city.\r\n\r\nHe also testified President Trump had suggested 10,000 to 20,000 would be needed to keep the peace at the public rallies and protests scheduled for January 6, 2021. Ornato also described White House frustration with Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller\u2019s slow deployment of assistance on the afternoon of January 6, 2021.\r\n\r\nNot only did the committee not accurately characterize the interview, they suppressed the transcript from public review. On top of that, committee allies began publishing critical stories and even conspiracy theories about Ornato ahead of follow-up interviews with him. Ornato was a career Secret Service official who had been detailed to the security position in the White House.\r\n\r\nCheney frequently points skeptics of her investigation to the Government Publishing Office website that posted, she said, \u201ctranscripts, documents, exhibits & our meticulously sourced 800+ page final report.\u201d That website provides \u201csupporting documents\u201d to the claims made by Cheney and fellow anti-Trump enthusiasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, transcripts of fewer than half of the 1,000 interviews the committee claims it conducted are posted on that site. It is unclear how many of the hidden transcripts include exonerating information suppressed by the committee.\r\n\r\nThose documents support the committee\u2019s narrative rather than the truth of the events leading up to January 6, 2021, said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, chairman of the House Administration\u2019s Subcommittee on Oversight.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe former J6 Select Committee apparently withheld Mr. Ornato\u2019s critical witness testimony from the American people because it contradicted their pre-determined narrative. Mr. Ornato\u2019s testimony proves what Mr. Meadows has said all along: President Trump did in fact offer 10,000 to 20,000 National Guard troops to secure the U.S. Capitol, which was turned down,\u201d said the Georgia Republican.\r\n\r\nHis subcommittee is reviewing the work of the January 6 committee, which has been accused of other unethical behavior at the expense of accuracy, as well as collusion with other Democrat efforts to prosecute political opponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is just one example of important information the former Select Committee hid from the public because it contradicted what they wanted the American people to believe,\u201d Loudermilk said. \u201cAnd this is exactly why my investigation is committed to uncovering all the facts, no matter the outcome.\u201d\r\n\r\nEarly Corroboration For Contested Claim\r\nA January 6 committee staffer asked Ornato, \u201cWhen it comes to the National Guard statement about having 10,000 to 20,000  troops or any other number of troops, do you recall any discussion prior to the 6th about whether and how many National Guard troops to deploy on January 6th?\u201d\r\n\r\nOrnato surprised the committee by noting he did recall a conversation between Meadows and Bowser: \u201cHe was on the phone with her and wanted to make sure she had everything that she needed,\u201d Ornato told investigators.\r\n\r\nOrnato said White House concerns about January 6 were related to fears that left-wing groups would clash with Trump protesters and that no one in the White House anticipated a riot at the Capitol. Antifa and other left-wing groups were planning protests for the same day. Left-wing groups had been involved in violent assaults on Trump supporters following public protests.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeadows \u201cwanted to know if she need any more guardsmen,\u201d Ornato testified. \u201cAnd I remember the number 10,000 to 20,000 coming up of, you know, \u2018The president wants to make sure that you have enough.\u2019 You know, \u2018He is willing to ask for 10,000 to  20,000 .\u2019 I remember that number. Now that you said it, it reminded me of it. And that she was all set. She had, I think it was like 350 or so for intersection control, and those types of things not in the law enforcement capacity at the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nOrnato was correct. Bowser declined the offer, asking only for a few hundred National Guard and requiring them to serve in a very limited capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo DCNG personnel shall be armed during this mission, and at no time, will DCNG personnel or assets be engaged in domestic surveillance, searches, or seizures of US persons,\u201d Bowser wrote in her letter requesting the D.C. National Guard. Bowser had been a strenuous critic of Republican  efforts to limit rioting from leftwing political activists in U.S. cities during 2020\u2019s summer of violence.\r\n-  THE REST ON REPLY",

We're going to end up putting Trump back in the White House over a war _six thousand miles_ away.  If he sides with Israel, the left doesn't vote for him.  If he sides with the Palestinians, Jewish voters and their supporters won't vote for him.  He's damned either way and we put him in this position.  Actually, whoever fomented the October 7th attacks put him in this position.  The students fighting each other on college campuses are on the same side.  Whichever side they're chanting \"from the river to the sea\" for, it's the side that puts Trump back in power and causes a war with Iran.",

Brute force is no longer necessary. \n\nThe capitalist priest class of Psychiatry, working in tandem with the State bureaucracy, regulates and polices the new Restriction and gelding of desire.

This dogma echoes perpetually, omnisciently by understanding voices in self-help books, billboards, radio commercials and television talk shows to convince the public to practice continual self-suppression and hormonal restraint. Any deviation is an indication of something severely wrong with the individual. \n\nPerhaps Lycanthropic Transformation Rites are in some way a Psychic Preparation for the millennial calamities that are thought to lie ahead. \n\nLegalism is a Language of Equivocations, a process of assimilation to violence and illogic.\n\nEtymology: government\nGubernare: to control\nMens/Mentis: mind\n\nculture\nColere: to inhabit, to till\nCult: collective mind\n-ure: process of\n\ncivilize, etc. \nCivitas: city\n-ize: to do/to make like\n\npolice, policy, politics, polite\nPolis: city\n\nauthority\nAuctor: master, father, creator\n-ity: quality of\n\nreligion\nReligare: to bind fast, to place an obligation on\n-ion: noun-forming suffix\n\nuniform\nUni-: one\nForm: shape\n\nThey lump themselves into a group.

    "What people make of this as we hear is that the Israeli government and the head of the military are using every minute and footage to promote their narrative of ''Success against terrorism'' with the hope of overpainting the reality behind it. They have a chance to gain ground with that. - - One reality behind it is that Israel's government opposing the long-standing Safety-For-Palestinians proposal of a Two-State-Solution, which yet has let Palestinian people be exposed to Israeli violence and forced displacement for 80 years now, made ground for extremist militia like Hamas to even exist.  - - Another reality is that Hamas can not be defeated with violence. As officials already quoted: ' Hamas is not only in Gaza, and most of all:  Hamas is an Idea, a determination. You can not defeat an idea, a determination, with violence, and even less you can defeat such 'Idea' when the idea itself exists as a response to violence in the first place. ' - -  After the current slaughter of tens of thousands of people we can be sure with a guarantee that multiple extremist militias get active and new militias are now in the making or already exist. While it was and is ultimately reasonable to support safe solutions for Jewish people, like for any marginalized people, Israel was established 80 years ago, in Palestine, by violently displacing the native population. At the time people could have different views on this, but today there are no two views on crimes against humanity. This history of at least 80 years has it that about no other outcome than the current horrific situation of an exchange of violence without end can be expected. - - People who call to stop this downward spiral of violence - because taking sides for parties in this only expands it until we get what is called Escalation that can hit us in the 'safe west' too - seem to look in the very right direction for this. - It's the call for a ceasefire, and that is why it is so important to stop now which otherwise will never end. // This current war and the decisions we are making as humans now on this small planet, are historical decisions, made locally, this time in and for the Middle East, but made for our global future.

The hypocrisy of GBNews' presenter Mark Dolon was made worse by his condemning of others when he too was guilty, such an odious little nonentity.\nAnyway, back to Kate, it is time for the media to cease their constant picking the bones of her situation, it is another form of constant sniping.

It is irrelevant what the courts decide to do with former president Donal J Trump, and whether they are justified in condemning him or not for his belief that this case is ridiculous and a joke. The American legal system is putting itself at risk of becoming unpredictable and corrupt as long as it continues to prohibit the teaching of Jesus' principles in schools. These teachings include our responsibilities towards God and our fellow humans, as mentioned in Matthew 7:12, Matthew 20:25-27, and Matthew 22:37-39. Banning the teachings of Jesus from public schools could create a political and social environment where lawyers defending US citizens with different political affiliations could be easily prosecuted and penalized by prosecutors and judges. Moreover, it could lead to the prosecution of former presidents for previously non-prosecutable actions and encourage lawmakers to propose bills in the US Congress that make it easier to assassinate former presidents. Regardless of whether Donald J. Trump is right or wrong about his opinion on this case, the American legal system is putting itself in danger by continuing to prohibit the recitation of Jesus' teachings in schools.",

    "So, Mr. Berry's remarks were made during a congressional hearing, in response to questioning from Representative Ayanna Pressley. This makes his statements even more concerning, as they were made in a public forum and before a body that has the power to shape laws and policies.\n\nRepresentative Pressley's question was likely intended to highlight the harmful nature of Mr. Berry's ideas, and his response indicating that they are \"great ideas\" is deeply troubling. It suggests that he is not only aware of the discriminatory nature of his policies but also actively endorses them.\n\nThis exchange highlights the importance of congressional oversight and the need for elected officials to hold policymakers accountable for their actions and beliefs. It also underscores the crucial role that representatives like Ayanna Pressley play in advocating for marginalized communities and pushing back against harmful ideologies.",
    "THE CASE FOR A TRUMP PRESIDENCY:\nThe Democrat's sole purpose is to take energy and resources from the Left. Period. They made that clear with what they did to Bernie Sanders, they would rather Trump than real progress because ultimately the goal is to consolidate money and power into the elites.\nWith that as a guide (let's stop pretending that the DNC hasn't been failing on purpose for 40ish years), the logical conclusion to our future is eventual climate catastrophe that will be the pretext to fascism. When that happens and we don't have a movement (greens) that has been well funded with trained people, they'll round up the political opposition and the new world order will be impossible to fight against (think of the French underground leading up to the Nazi take over but now they have an algorithm that flags the people who are capable of fighting back).\n\nTherefore, I'm starting to think a second Trump presidency might be in everyone's best interest. If Biden is re-elected everyone gets to go back to brunch and pretend that democracy is ok. A Biden presidency would reward the DNC for being corrupt, breaking all its promises to the Left, kids still in cages, refugees dying at the border, failure on climate, failure on healthcare, continuing to promote the proxy war against Russia and American complicity for the genocide in Gaza.\n  However, if Trump is re-elected everyone will remember that children are still dying in detention, democracy is under direct threat, the world is burning and at least Trump says he would try to end the war in Ukraine (obviously Trump would nuke Ukraine for a nickel but the fact he even suggested peace is better than the DNC's current pro WW3 stance. Sadly the same with Gaza).\n  Also, let's say we drag Biden across the line and now he doesn't have to face re-election do people honestly believe he'll go against the donors!?!? Another thing is the fact that if Biden serves a full 8 years it will almost certainly ensure a GOP sweep of all 3 levels of government and this time it won't be a moronic gameshow host but a capable authoritarian who will have unlimited power. I'd rather Trump win and let him grift for another term with divided government than face the prospect of a GOP 2028 sweep after 4 more years of Neoliberal policies under Biden.\n  The reality is that we can boil the climate frog slow or fast but it's going to fry either way. If the fire is stoked it would re-unite the real Left and remind the Corporate Democrats that breaking every promise has consequences or if we are really lucky, public awareness that the duopoly won't save us and force regular people to understand that they're also in the same boiling pot........\n\nThe system works. Let's stop supporting it, vote 3rd party.",
    "Biden is not too old....he is mentally incapable.  Trump will win in a landslide which is much needed at this point.

    "The MF's on the Shit-eme Court are doing what they can for Trump. Fine. Let them fellatiate away. But however they decide, if they get their decision in by May or June, hopefully the trial court will push the case through in 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, whatever, to get a verdict at least several weeks before the election. But more important than the verdict itself, is that the evidence get before the public, who are indeed the ULTIMATE JURY in this case, rendering their VERDICT on election day.\n\nSCOTUS, far as I'm concerned, is just a TUB of over-politicized, corrupt partisan SHIT at this point, just like they were under Rhenquist in Bush-Gore. As much as I hate this decision, and that the bastards waited 3 weeks to do it to stretch it out and give Trump the biggest delay they could, the CLARITY of the situation now means we need no longer mince words or claim to any pretense of the current SCUMBUS under its militant majority not being a pure partisan entity along the lines of Fox News. Far as I'm concerned, the current SCUMBUS is just the LEGAL HENCHMEN DEPARTMENT of the TUCKER CARLSON SHOW. So any lower court must assume that's how SCUMBUS is operating, and do all it can to DEFY and THWART those SCUMBUS racketeer-henchmen. \n\nThis means: as much as the law will permit (and SCUMBUS cannot prevent), give Trump an expedited TELEVISED trial, maximally exposing the evidence of trump criminality to the public, so the public can make its verdict.",
    "2:00 old mate has his Biden story confused.. Biden was interested in running in 2016 but he was going through the loss of his (Good) son and by the time he got focused it was already way too late because Hillary Clinton had locked down support of so much of the establishment players early, which is why there were no other big names from the party establishment who came forward to challenge in 2016 - Bernie Sanders not coming from the establishment and not reliant on the support of the party establishment was able to run a very competitive campaign but for a candidate like Joe Biden it wasn't possible because he would have had to compete with Hillary for the same insiders and donors; so Biden didn't run because he was upset with how they treated Obama, Joe Biden even ended up contributing to Obama's nightmares (Nuland worked for Biden, and his team caused the Euromaidan mess in 2014 which soured relations with Russia)",

    "Why is it that so many experts believe that McAfee is reasonable, just, and fair?\nOnce the judge opened the door to this spectacle, his cards were revealed. His professional and ideological relationships instantly provided focus for his end goals; when, for the first time in American history, the bench used the open court to cradle and nurture an immature and evidence free fishing expedition. If unprofessional actually means anything, I believe this unusual indulgence for the defense by the judge is the obvious choice; the best (or worst) candidate action by leaps and bounds. \nThe statute rendering bore out the actual legally justifiable conclusions; minus the fluff surrounded by distraction - there is no actual conflict of interest. \nIn The American court system standards of evidence, democratic protocols and procedures based on Constitutional justice protect citizens and even prosecutors from what another person \"feels\" is mendatious even \" feelings \" from a judge without proof beyond a reasonable doubt supported by evidence.\u00a0 Direct testimony that a judge wants to believe is a lie has to be countered by Direct evidence to a specific event or Direct testimony from a credible Fact witness with Direct and specific opposing accounts of particular actions of an accused. \nGeneral accounts of the nature of an expanded timeline without specific content of individual events and no eye witness descriptions are not a standard of evidence in the American court system and definitely not something any PROFESSIONAL judge or reasonably credible judge would base his \" feelings \" on. \nThe judge wants the public to believe that it was legally improper for the DA to defend herself and her lead prosecutors qualifications.\u00a0 Posing the question, if this could be racial? The lead prosecutor proved his qualifications, acumen and legal acuity in the indictments rendered and guilty pleas long before this salacious briefing that the judge ultimately found no conflict of interest proven. I believe that there is circumstantial evidence that the briefing relied on racial misgivings to get a foothold and gain traction. \nThe judge could have simply showed experience and good judgment by taking full control of the matter in chambers until and when the defense could provide indisputable and compelling evidence of their accusations. \nAll these legal experts, and you don't hear a peep about what the judge served up in his ruling from the bench to dismiss 6 charges out of hand with a legal tactic of challenging specificity in part of the indictment where the defense can refute accusations in the case\u00a0 that point to an individual violation of statute. The referenced charge is about violating oath of office. H. Litman discussion with K. F. Magnifalo pointed out to me that the judge used the statute violation as the charge would be attributed to the office holder and specific violations are required for a proper defense; but here the office holder did not commit a crime and thus did not further the conspiracy connecting to specific violations of thier individual oaths. Basically, here we have an illegal intent to corrupt an official that has an obligation to adhere to the American and State Constitutions in the execution of thier duties.\u00a0 The defense is not harmed by an omission of which part of the oath is violated\u00a0 because the offer was not accepted and no specific violation occurred.\u00a0 \nThe corruption occurred in the official and unofficial presentation of false statements, false evidence. Corruption is clear in the ask and it's intent. \nThis squarely centers on the point; that it appears to me that these charges fundamentally hold the whole case together. \nIt seems to me that the judge quietly and technically unfastened the structure of this case.\u00a0 Giving the defense a crowbar of which to separate and exclude much of the critical evidence in the case.\nThe judge was too cute by half. The judge could not legally remove the DA based on the statute and evidence. He could not even legally remove Wade, but with brazen coercion, the judge eluded to his authority to do so without statutory support. The judge cited a nonrule as his basis for that authority. In a move that would make a snake blush; encouraged the prosecution to make the decision to kneecap thier own case by dismissing Wade; while leaving judge's hands legally clean; not having to deal with or answer for an unsupported ruling.\u00a0 Mwtahh! Fortissimo!\nThis is a sad affair, but it's funny that so many experts believe that Wade was obviously expendable. Look at the roles. Willis role as an aggressive, fearless DA that puts the principles in place.\u00a0 She had to accept the intense danger posed and unrelenting threats to her life for undertaking this\u00a0 case. Patiently, persistently, and methodically pursued all criminal involvement.\u00a0 Without hesitation or apprehension,  moved in a measured timely manner and managed an office taking on the most consequential and ambitious criminal case in recent American history.\u00a0 The braintrust Wade strategized a legal framework for a sprawling rico case and indictments of some of the most powerful people and resourced people in America. Up against high powerd lawyers\u00a0 and a base of supporters that have proven to be fanatical and violent. \nOf all the states in America that similar crimes were committed, only Fani Willis in the State of Georgia actually brought charges.\nOf every high-powered lawyer with Clout and weight to handle leading this case (that she can trust), ONLY Nathan Wade accepted. \nA sprawling rico indictment against these particular\u00a0 power players are not for \" next up\" players. \nExperts that\u00a0 like to casually downplay Nathan Wade's importance, successes, strategic planning, and prowess; just like to talk and push air around on tv. \nThe judge would not hesitate to dismiss Willis OR Wade if he had the law on his side, but he needed to effectuate the ouster of Wade without the courage of his convictions or the clarity of the law. Getting Willis out now was less realistic, but this is the long game. \nThe judge and the criminal defendants are very clear about Wade's talents and abilities. TV and online commentators not so much. \nThe judge wants his cake, and he's going to eat it too. The judge did not dismiss Fani Willis,but he destroyed her case. He vaguely eluded to,but did not courageously and clearly call her a liar - and he did not dismiss her.\nThe judge said that he should impose a gag order on her, two months later, after the church defense of her reputation and the qualifications of Wade - and he did not dismiss her.\nThe judge ruled that Willis relationship with Wade was not an actual conflict of interest, but in some strange nonstatute nonrule, it is a problem, so someone has to go. You choose - and he did not dismiss her.\nTwo years Nathan Wade has successfully maneuvered this case as the lead prosecutor. \nThat is irreplaceable.\nShould be obvious, but smart people on tv and online know better; sure, let the \"next up\" player in the game; take over under an all out blitz and throw in intense full court pressure under threat of life and family safety; and oh yeah, shouldn't have any problem trusting anybody willing to jump in. \nThe judge destroyed the case. There is no case without Fani Willis or Nathan Wade. Some people just can't see reality or the gravity of what they are looking at. \nLook, I get it. Some of us can't look away from a Black Woman and this salacious sexual spectacle. So much so that they find a comfy place in judging the appropriateness of her personal relationships and can't seem to understand that this is not a question of law. They suspend acknowledgment of real danger and focus on a perceived lack of prosecutorial discretion on the part of a Black Woman that can't go outside for a walk, and neither can her lead prosecutor. No restaurants, movies, parks etc. \nThis Black Woman cooped up, basically sequestered for two years or more, might find a talented braintrust appealing. \nYeah, but smart people got all the answers to base their loose judgements. \nThe DA should hire Wade back and force the judge to follow through on his threat. Make him back his decision with the law.\nThis will also be an opportunity to put a spotlight on his technical sabotage. Appeal his ruling showing that criminal parties outside the office holder are not due specifics of particular areas of violation of oath, whereas these criminal parties are not the potential violators or office holder; they are the corruptors.\u00a0 A particular specific violation need not occur when an outside party asks with criminal intent.",

He asserts that prior to 1948, Gaza was not known as a\n\"strip\" but was a cosmopolitan town with a rich, diverse culture.\nIn a video circulating online from January 2024, Pappe emphasises that the term \"Gaza Strip\" emerged post-1948, following the Israeli invasion, reshaping Gaza's identity and geography.\n\nHamas\u2019 attack would be part of any wartime narrative of a retaliatory strike. And of course any war is horrific. But to single out Hamas\u2019 retaliatory strike as unjustified is linguistic racism. \n\nHamas\u2019 attack on Oct 7, was not just a random attack on an area. It was on the villages taken by Israel from where Palestinians were expelled to Gaza.",

    "please learn proper history. Palestine was a british colony that fought for its freedom from british rule. It was at that time that the balfour declaration was signed illegally to promise palestine to build a holy land for the jewish people(primarily zionists). At first the palestinian people welcomed the jewish people as refugees of war. But when the numbers started increasing and the zionists which were veterans of world war started occupying land by forcefully evicting palestinians, cutting down their olive trees (which were their source of income) and pushing them towards a refugee status in their own country, violence broke out. The british empire after the balfour declaration initially supported the zionists, which is very evident from the speeches of winston churchill. The following violence that occurred could not be stopped and governed by the british empire that had grown weak after the world war. The zionists started buying large amounts of ammunition and tanks to fight the palestinians and were slowly pushing them out of their own land with their superior military and financial might. The british that could not contain the violence rubbed it onto the newly formed UN that promised 55% of the land to the zionists and 45% to the palestinians in 1948. One might think it is a fair judgement, but the catch was, the jewish population at that time in palestine was 33% and they were promised more than 55% of the land and that was a great injustice to the palestinians that were in the majority. Israel therefore agreed to the resolution while the palestinians and arabs disagreed. The other catch was that even in the 55% land offered to the zionists, the majority population were  palestinians. Israel killed over 17000 people and displaced over 750,000 people. this event is called the Nakba. The violence and injustice resulted in war with with the neighbouring arab nations like syria, Lebanon, Egypt etc that lost to israel. after the formation of israel in 1948, and after many years of oppression the PA(palestinian authority) was formed. They launched multiple campaigns known as Intifada against israel to reclaim their land. after more than 30 years since the formation of israel in 1948 hamas was formed and was initially supported by israel to oppose the PA. many wars were fought like intifadas, Yom kipur war, etc. and finally the Oslo accords decided to agree to the formation of an independant state of palestine, which included west bank, gaza strip and jerusalem(jointly owned territory). But israel continued to build settlements by evicting people out of west bank. gaza continues to be controlled, with a land, sea and air blockade.The amount of calories going inside gaza is also controlled. Israel uses every possible war crime like collective punishment, Starvation, white phosphorous on civilian population, killing journalists(Eg:Shireen Abu Akhlaq(palestinian christain shot in the head whose death ceremony was also vandalised by israeli police)), Activists(Eg: Rachel Corry(American activist was run over by a bulldozer and her family is still seeking justice for their daughter, the palestinians in respect even named a street after her sacrifice), bombing hospitals, bombing UN schools, refugee camps etc. From 1948 to now over a 100,000 palestinians have perished with the latest death toll going well past 32,000. People that still say it was because of terrorists need to rethink and redefine what a terrorist is. A terrorist is not someone that is fighting an occupation, here it is very evident that it is palestine that is occupied and the palestinian people that were killed and their land taken(settlements over west bank). So if there is anyone that has a right to defend themselves, by all means it is the palestinians and not the other way around. Those who still support the occupation I pray u never have to be turned to refugees in ur own land, have ur children and family killed and still be called a terrosist for resisting. If such a situation occurs, I will fight for u too.",

This group: No proclamations, no flags, no balaclavas, no keffiyehs, no hostage taking, fleeing instead of seeking martyrdom, being paid to conduct an attack...I don't buy it for a minute that ISIS was the lead on this. The US chose ISIS as the \"villain\" to try to sideline support from the Palestinians, and Muslims in general. 2) Putin has spoken to the Russian public twice since this happened, so far as I know. I watched the speeches myself 3) The US Security Alert was published on March 7, and advised caution for 48 hours. The journalist here said the attack occurred a couple of days later. Wrong. It was a couple of weeks later. So of course people had let their guard down.  4) This idea that Clark has that the Ukrainina government are angels, and would never harm civilians is laughable, They harmed 14,000 civilians before Putin crossed the border, and many since.

That's why asking IMPORTANT, and now CRUCIAL questions is CRITICAL for Democrats.. if they stick with their favorite \"we know better\" shtick, then they'll lose not just the White House, but most likely  both chambers too.. And if that happens, and Democratic Establishment fails completely to address concerns and needs of their voters, then perhaps Democratic voters, including voters of Bernie Sanders and AOC, centrist voters (from both isles), \"independent\" voters, and ANYONE who is tired of Democratic Establishment playing \"we know better\", and Republican.. well, no longer Republican, but rather MAGA Establishment CONSTANTLY lying and committing crimes, then maybe it will be time to create a brand new party, win over all three branches of government, and at LONG LAST make ACTUAL changes that benefits ALL Americans, not just billionaires and corporations..\n\nP.S. I think they should replace Biden with Bernie Sanders..\ud83d\ude42 One thing Bernie is, it's being consistent..

Russia is, and has always been a non-Western country. Not for a single second in Russia's entire millennia-spanning existence was the country ever operating by a Western standard of values, justice, or good governance - not in the Varangian Era, the Kievan-Rus Era, the Tatar-yoke Era, the Tsarist Era, the Soviet Era, the Yeltsin Era, or the Putin Era. Not a day had passed by since the Dawn of Civilization had Russian rulers not been killing Russian dissidents. As an American/Canadian dual-citizen living and paying tax in Maryland, why should I be in a fuzz about the Russian regime doing things in typical Russian ways, or give a damn about whether a particular Russian guy is alive or dead within Russia?\n\nIs it Putin's oppression that led to tens of millions of Americans living on food stamps? Here in my hometown Rockville the tents set up by the homeless spread from the Central Park all the way to the mall on the other side of the river just a few hundred yards out of my own windows. Yet when you turn on the TV the politicians and \"experts\" such as this one don't give a f--k  about the daily struggles and sufferings of the mothers, fathers and children who are their own compatriots, but only reserve their outrage for foreign rulers over events in foreign lands, while enthusing about sending tens of billions American tax dollars overseas to sponsor a foreign war - WTF - seriously, WTF!!!!\nThat's why President Trump must win in 2024 - we don't support Trump because of any sympathy for Putin - everyone with a functioning brain recognizes that ex-KGB as nothing but a murderous thug - an epithet that can also be rightfully applied to 99% of Russia's historical rulers. But Putin's thuggery is beside the point - why should American tax-payers prioritize issues related to Putin, or any foreign regimes, good or bad, over the bread-and-butter interests of our own people, millions of whom are starving and homeless???? Americans should come first - that's all that matters. Liberals can keep turning a blind eye to the home front crisis and self-righteously indulge in their moralist grandstanding over foreign rulers. (Maybe they should all emigrate to Russia and join the Russian opposition movements and leave American taxpayers alone.) For American patriots who are proudly American, neither the agendas of Putin nor Navalny, or any other foreigner, matters as much as putting working class Americans' interests back on the driver's seat of America's resource prioritization.
