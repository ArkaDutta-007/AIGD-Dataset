Dishonesty is something we don't like in others. The sturdiest pillars of human morality are compassion and a sense of justice.\r\n\r\nThe role of inequity in society is grossly underestimated. Inequity is not good for your health, basically. Robin Hood had it right. Humanity's deepest wish is to spread the wealth.\"\r\n\r\nFrans de Waal\n\n\n\"Politics is not the art of the possible. It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable. All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time. This, and not much else, is the essence of leadership.\n\nMen of conservative temperament have long suspected that one thing leads to another. In the conventional wisdom of conservatives, the modern search for security is regularly billed as the greatest single threat to economic progress. The capacity for erroneous belief is very great, especially where it coincides with convenience. Milton Friedman\u2019s misfortune is that his economic policies have been tried. \n\nMr. David Stockman has said that supply-side economics was merely a cover for the trickle-down approach to economic policy \u2014 what an older and less elegant generation called the horse-and-sparrow theory: If you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows.\n\nA point must be repeated: only the pathological weakness of the financial memory...allows us to believe that the modern experience of....debt...is in any way a new phenomenon. \n\nThe problem of the modern economy is not a failure of a knowledge of economics; it's a failure of a knowledge of history. The world of finance hails the invention of the wheel over and over again, often in a slightly more unstable version. \r\n\nWere it part of our everyday education and comment that the corporation is an instrument for the exercise of power, that it belongs to the process by which we are governed, there would then be debate on how that power is used and how it might be made subordinate to the public will and need. This debate is avoided by propagating the myth that the power does not exist.\r\n\nThe salary of the chief executive of a large corporation is not a market award for achievement. It is frequently in the nature of a warm personal gesture by the individual to himself.\n\r\nThat one never need to look beyond the love of money for explanation of human behavior is one of the most jealously guarded simplifications of our culture. The huge capacity to purchase submission that goes with any large sum of money, well, this we have. This is a power of which we should all be aware.\r\n\nThe modern conservative is not even especially modern. He is engaged, on the contrary, in one of man\u2019s oldest, best financed, most applauded, and, on the whole, least successful exercises in moral philosophy. That is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness. It is an exercise which always involves a certain number of internal contradictions and even a few absurdities. ... Liberalism is, I think, resurgent. One reason is that more and more people are so painfully aware of the alternative.\n\nInflation does not lubricate trade but by rescuing traders from their errors of optimism or stupidity. Almost every aspect of its (Federal Reserve) history should be approached with a discriminating disregard for what is commonly taught or believed. If anything is evident about people who manage money, it is that the task attracts a very low level of talent, one that is protected in its highly imperfect profession by the mystery that is thought to enfold the subject of economics in general and of money in particular.\r\n\nNo politician can praise unemployment or inflation, and there is no way of combining high employment with stable prices that does not involve some control of income and prices. Otherwise the struggle for more consumption and more income to sustain it-a struggle that modern corporations, modern unions and modern democracy all facilitate and encourage-will drive up prices. Only heavy unemployment will then temper this upward thrust. Not many wish to confront the truth that the modern economy gives a choice only between inflation, unemployment, or controls.\n\nI was in charge of price controls in World War II and had a ceiling on overall prices. Everybody who was subject to general maximum price regulation wanted an exception and went to Congress to persuade a Congressman, or a group of people on the Hill, that I was being a menace to their industry.\r\n\r\nIn numerous years following the war, the Federal Government ran a heavy surplus. It could not (however) pay off its debt, retire its securities, because to do so meant there would be no bonds to back the national bank notes. To pay off the debt was to destroy the money supply.\r\n\nI am not quite sure what the advantage is in having a few more dollars to spend if the air is too dirty to breathe, the water too polluted to drink, the commuters are losing out in the struggle to get in and out of the city, the streets are filthy, and the schools so bad that the young perhaps wisely stay away, and the hoodlums roll citizens for some of the dollars they saved in the tax cut.\n\nHere in briefest form is the modern political dialectic. It is an unequal contest: the rich and the comfortable have influence and money. And they vote. The concerned and the poor have numbers, but many of the poor, alas, do not vote. There is democracy, but in no slight measure it is a democracy of the fortunate.\"\n\r\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith", "Go to N.B.C.'s coverage of Trump's renomination ceremony.

For example, the disqualification of Chris Christie in Maine due to insufficient signatures has received limited attention in comparison. Notably absent from the discourse is the acknowledgment that each candidate must adhere to individual state requirements for eligibility, thus mitigating concerns of chaos ensuing from state-level decisions.\n\nIt is imperative to underscore the inviolable principle that due process must never be sacrificed at the altar of expediency. In the recent case before the Colorado Supreme Court, exhaustive hearings were conducted, culminating in the factual determination that Donald Trump participated in the insurrection. Consequently, the Court is bound by the mandates of the United States Constitution and the 14th Amendment to remove him from the ballot. It is essential to recognize that this is not a criminal trial but a civil proceeding, where the burden of proof rests upon the preponderance of evidence, indicating a likelihood greater than not.", "*Your Typical Fascist Democrats.

Biden regarding collusion against free speech. The landmark decision was treated like a democrat Biden address when the teleprompter malfunctions -- little was reported and analyzed.  \n\nThe appeals court ruled against the democrat government for colluding with a variety of democrat social media sites suppressing free speech.  The  74-page opinion underscores the synchronization during Chinese Wuhan virus scam between democrat social media and their democrat government overlords. It wasn\u2019t difficult work. Any post that questioned or contradicted the democrat narrative was censored.\n\nThese coddled, overpaid leftist techies working for, and in many cases running these media empires, were more than happy to obey their democrat government masters.

This decision is designed to protect free speech from democrat government censorship through private democrat social media platforms.\n\nIn retrospect, all the pandemic edicts from Uncle Sam are another example of many abuses of free speech. During the Trump administration, Attorney General William Barr explained that there was no pandemic exception to the Constitution, but few listened. Then the democrat Biden administration comes along and claims they were protecting Americans from \u201cdisinformation\u201d by censoring all criticism of their Chinese Wuhan virus narrative. \n\nThese democrat tyrants locked down the country for the better part of two years, with a huge assist coming via the suppression of speech.

Politicians aren't required to tell the public everything, especially if it's confidential.

Since he did that and if he did pay for himself, like the lawyer said, there's no crime, so why would he have to reveal that information to the public?

If someone want to believe what is in their mind and not look to reality and fact information to come to a diluted conclusion of what the world looks like, then all those individuals need is a Republican standing in a vague shadow of words. Example: If a person stands near a train track and suggest that in their mind they shall not see a train appoaching and just walks across being run over believing the dilution in their mind, then that person would be a good candidate for a republican to pursuit a vote, as long as the fool didn't die.

That sum is in addition to the more than $293,000 that Daniels had been ordered to pay after losing a libel case against the former president in federal district court and $245,000 for unsuccessfully pursuing an earlier appeal.\r\nThe New York and California cases aren\u2019t directly related, but the timing was striking since they involve the same underlying events: Daniels\u2019 claim that she had an affair with Trump \u2014 which he has denied \u2014 and efforts by Trump\u2019s former longtime lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen to stop her story from becoming public ahead of the 2016 presidential election by orchestrating a $130,000 hush-money payment. \r\nTrump pleaded not guilty on Tuesday in Manhattan state court to a 34-count indictment that accuses him of falsifying business records in order to hide reimbursement payments to Cohen and influence the election. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office has alleged that Trump falsified records to further other crimes, including violating state and federal election laws.The California case dates back to 2018. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, had sued Trump over a tweet in which he accused her of a \u201ctotal con job\u201d after she said she\u2019d been threatened in order to keep quiet about her claim of having an affair. A judge ruled in late 2018 that Trump\u2019s tweet was \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d protected under the First Amendment, and then ordered Daniels to pay nearly $292,000 in legal fees plus a $1,000 sanction.\r\n\r\nDaniels appealed, and after losing the first round, in March 2022 was ordered to pay more than $245,000 in fees. The 9th Circuit then rejected Daniels\u2019 appeal of the district judge\u2019s original attorney fee award, finding she had waited too long to present it. Daniels had acknowledged she was responsible for paying fees as the losing party, but argued the fee request by Trump\u2019s lawyers for $128,000 was \u201cexcessive.\u201d A special commissioner tasked with evaluating Trump\u2019s request denied part of it because the lawyers hadn\u2019t submitted an itemized task log, but approved the bulk of it.\r\nDaniels\u2019 attorneys didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\r\nTrump\u2019s attorney Harmeet Dhillon provided a statement saying that they were \u201cgratified that the 9th Circuit awarded the vast majority of fees incurred in the final stage of this litigation that never should have taken a moment of the court\u2019s time. In total, the court awarded our client over $600,000 in fees in this dispute that Ms. Clifford initiated.

Also in those other countries, people are raised to fear their government and most of those governments are set up to have the total control over their population. This is why they're incarcerations are lower than the US. Also, this just goes to show that if we were to take away the total freedom mentality and start raising kids to believe they don't have as much freedom as they think they do, then they'll grow with less of a mindset that they can do whatever and to whomever they want.

It is strange for the notoriously difficult-to-contact IRS to ever show up at someone\u2019s home unannounced, especially for something as simple as what wound up being two previous tax returns rejected due to suspicion of identity theft.

Both journalists were accused by leftist politicians of being pawns and \u201cscribes\u201d for Elon Musk. In full disclosure, Elon did provide Taibbi, Bari Weiss, and potentially Schellenberger with a treasure trove of data to dig through and report on. However, Elon Musk also gave them full autonomy to report whatever they saw fit, including information that could be damaging to Musk himself. Taibbi and the other journalists assigned to this task did their jobs without bias from political pressure and that might actually be the problem.  The information found within the Twitter Files was not just about Twitter. The entire Federal Government, all major social media platforms, and a plethora of private entities working alongside politicians were exposed. The Federal Government had set up an official system of social media content moderation. Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms would get requests directly from the Government to censor certain posts and people. This is obviously why the Hunter Biden laptop story, which came from a reputable source in the New York Post, was censored across all major platforms.

They don't see the generational racism against non-whites, because they have only experienced it from the perspective of their expectation of privilege. On a level playing field, where only experience, and competition are in play, both white and black applicants have an equal opportunity; no favoritism based on skin color should prevail. \n\nThe problem with that scenario is that white men in power have created an anti-Constitutional 'ownership mentality' in which only the white race has superior intellect, skills, and a birthright to succeed, with all other races subservient to the white race.

But it is precisely at such times that the Truths about God and those ascetics who will help bring this pure Knowledge to people are most needed! \nNow is the time for meditation, for Fusion, for Immersion in the continuity of life in God!\n\nIt is also important to understand that it will not be as good as it was before. It will be fine, but otherwise. Events and interactions between everyone will develop differently.\n\nIt would be good to develop the topic: \"Man, nature, God\" (or in another order). \n\nOften people defile nature with their neglect, pollute it by littering. An example for improvement: when they saw the garbage, they picked it up, took it to the trash. And already our planet will begin to be cleansed from this, and we will begin to take care of others, not just ourselves.\n\nNow a serious expansion of Spiritual Work is coming. It is possible to cover a much larger number of people with the topic of mental self-regulation: according to the book \"Ecopsychology\", an example of an exercise: imagine the sun in your chest, i.e. in a spiritual heart with rays-handles and we will embrace everyone around, including the planet. This exercise develops emotions of love in a person.\n\nIt is very important to teach people the ability to live with a spiritual heart, to live in states of tender love. It is possible to do this, including through the beauty of nature!\n\nAccording to the book: Antonov V.V. \u2014 Ecopsychology. \u201cNew Atlanteans\u201d, Bancroft, 2008.\n\nSw\u0430mi-C\u0435nt\u0435r . \u043e rg", "Everyone knows Trump is correct. \n\nTrumps criticism of the judge was the central issue of that case and again obviously 100% correct. \n\nThe carol case was as much if not more corrupt than this civil case.

They create an environment of fear and intimidation, undermining the public's trust in the justice system. This undermines the rule of law, as it encourages government officials to ignore the law when it suits their political interests. It also erodes the public's trust in the justice system, as people may question whether justice is being served fairly or if it is being used as a political tool. Politically motivated indictments can also be used to silence dissent and chill free speech, as individuals may be scared to speak out against the government for fear of being targeted. Further, it can create a two-tiered justice system where those in power are given preferential treatment and the law is used as a weapon to punish their political opponents.

Now chiefly: alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice\u201dWoke\u2019s earliest politically conscious usage came in 1962, in The New York Times\u2019 article \u201cIf You\u2019re Woke You Dig It\u201d  by the then Harlem-based writer William Melvin Kelley {A Different Drummer} who was highlighting the phenomenon of Black American slang being appropriated by white people who often missed or altogether distorted the words\u2019 original meanings, until the idioms were taken over, inevitably transformed, and ultimately abandoned by their original Black creators. \n{Example; Black Lives Matter=White Lives Matter=Blue Lives Matter=All Lives Matter=BLM PFFT}\n\n\u201cWe must fight \u2018the woke\u2019 in our schools. We must fight \u2018the woke\u2019 in our businesses. We must fight \u2018the woke\u2019 in government agencies,\u201d Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently declared from the stage at a campaign event. \u201cWe can never, ever surrender to woke ideology. And I\u2019ll tell you this, the state of Florida is where woke goes to die.\u201d\n\nHis boast about Florida isn\u2019t an empty threat. From his powerful pulpit as the state\u2019s governor, DeSantis engineered and recently signed into law the \u201cStop W.O.K.E.\u201d Act, a title that precisely captures what the bill\u2019s architects aimed to do: stop people in Florida from speaking out in ways that challenge racism and other kinds of discrimination.  \n\nThe measure leverages severe penalties, including firing educators and pulling state funding from educational institutions, for violations of its intentionally vague, yet broad, speech and viewpoint limitations \u2014 all to brutally chill conversations about racism, gender inequality, and LGBTQ+ people. It also prohibits promoting specific phrases and concepts, like \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that are critical to explaining how discrimination is perpetuated and to understanding the impact of inequality on people\u2019s everyday lives.\n\nThe Stop W.O.K.E. Act threatens not only the free speech and livelihood of teachers \u2014 especially Black educators, who are more likely to teach subjects that involve the prohibited concepts. It will also undeniably damage the quality of education received by all students attending public institutions in Florida. That\u2019s why the Legal Defense Fund (LDF), along with co-counsel the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), ACLU Florida, and Ballad Spahr, filed suit challenging the law and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to halt its implementation. The suit argues that the Stop W.O.K.E. Act is unconstitutional and discriminatory.\n\n Ask yourself: What exactly is \u201cthe woke?\u201d Where did \u201cwoke\u201d come from?

I could always find a comfortable place where I could read and get lost in a book, do homework, write, sketch, do puzzles, and think.\n\nYou had to be measured and disciplined in the library. You had to respect the librarians, but you knew they were also there to help when needed. There were study rooms where you could meet with a tutor, a friend, or be on your own and undisturbed. You could spread out reference books and other primary resources on clean, sturdy, well-lit, working tables to complete schoolwork. You could listen to records with earphones by yourself or with friends. You could make photocopies, check out audio-visual materials, use computers and access the Internet. You could see interesting exhibits displayed in serious glass cases and have story times for the littles. (They even had toys and hand puppets to check-out.) You could get on wait-lists for brand-new books and see copies on display of the upcoming titles. My library had a shiny pay phone in its lobby and public bathrooms, too. Everything was spacious, clean and well-tended. I felt cared-for by my public library and my school libraries, too.\n\nUsing the library taught me how to take responsibility for the books I checked out, read voraciously, returned on time, or returned late (with relative consequences). I *needed* my library. I could never have afforded to pay out-of-pocket for all the books I read. I learned how to find materials using the cataloging system in an orderly fashion, but also to discover them by walking the aisles and by spinning the racks. The tactile reward and intellectual stimulation instigated by *browsing* should not be underestimated. \n\nTaking libraries away is not about money because the resources are there. (If the resources are *not* there then they have been mismanaged.) Taking libraries away is about power and dis-empowerment. We must have libraries in schools and in the public communities. Taking them away does us all a cruel disservice and is a violation to us all.", "American Media has become co-dependent on Trump.  WAY over-covering him.

We said companies would take care of employee retirement (social security) and insurance instead of government (and instead of companies raising wages enough so people could still have savings). What happened? They started hiring 2 people at 20 hours (with constantly shifting schedules) or capping 1 person at 39 hours to get out of it. Salaries were supposed to be the 'safe choice' but companies now expect us to do 60-80 hours of work (its what I've been doing at the past every corp I've worked for in the past 20 years, including multiple fortune 500 companies, constantly creeping up with expectations) for 40 hours of pay because 'they don't measure your hours, they trust you.. but you know, Jerry next to you finished twice as much as you did, and we Do cut our workforce every X years..... ' ('raising the bar', 'trimming 30%', etc). Companies don't so much 'hate' workers as they think of them as 'human resources' that are annoyingly expensive and that need to be optimized out of costs at every opportunity. Tell them to give us 4 day weeks? Oh they'll jump at that - they'll only hire part-timers, 3/4 day schedules (alternating so you can't hold down a second job), and blame this effort for it. 'Tsk.. yea.. its not Us wanting to cut your hours... they made us do it.. such a shame...' Oh sure, the first year they might subsidize the missing day each week.

After that.. if you're salaried your computer goes home with you, and Jerry there did just a little more then you.. we don't know how, we don't ask these questions, but...  If you're not salaried then the next CEO comes in and goes 'yea, I'm loving this productivity.. but what we just you know... Just hire for 4 days in the future instead of paying for 5? And the people in the old plan.. well... we are just going in a different direction, its not personal..'\n\nAnd the other option would be for government to step in.

We stratify ourselves by 'real blue collar workers that know what real hard work is!' or 'white collar workers that keep up the whole GDP of the country and subsidize everyone!' or whatever. A large portion of the country cheerfully accepts that while in their states women should be forced to incubate cells until they become people, the moment the actual living beings pop out society shouldn't pay for their lunches, education, safety, or anything - if someone dies it means they didn't have the moral fortitude to be successful! Capitalism has moved from a (fairly good) economic system to a religion, complete with tithing, punishment, and human sacrifices. Many (hard working) people tattoo on themselves DNR and carry dog-tags that say 'if anything happens don't call an ambulance' because death is preferable to hospital bills.

I'll also mention that New Hampshire is one of a few states that doesn't have a full service VA hospital for veterans.

This decision can be likened to attempting to drown someone by throwing them overboard tied to professional swimmers equipped with floating devices. Paradoxically, this misguided move strengthens Trump's defense, providing him with an unexpected opportunity to be acquitted of the indictments against him. I will delve deeper into the reasons why this joint indictment with 8 lawyers accused as his co-conspirators inadvertently strengthens Trump's defense.\n\nThe decision by the US government to jointly indict lawyers alongside former President Donald Trump has raised eyebrows. That decision to indict lawyers alongside former President Donald Trump is actually a blessing in disguise for Trump. \n\nI say this because, myself who is a law student know that involving legal professionals in the indictment undermines the complainants case. By including legal experts in the charges, will give those lawyers the opportunity not only the chance to defend themselves fiercely but also force the court to examine the evidence they have to expose wrongdoing in the elections . Senior lawyers like Rudy Giuliani who is also indicted with Trump possess a deep understanding of the law and its intricacies, so he will counter the accusations effectively, ultimately leading to a just outcome for Trump and all his co accused .\n\nLawyers, by virtue of their profession, possess an intimate understanding of the legal system. They are well-versed in the intricacies of the law, making them valuable assets when it comes to challenging accusations. By indicting lawyers alongside Trump placing them on the other side of the law , will tap deeply into their knowledge of the law to exonerate themselves. These legal professionals can and will scrutinize the charges, identify any weaknesses or inconsistencies, and mount a strong defense. Their combine expertise ensures that the legal proceedings will be  conducted with precision and adherence to the rule of law. Their presence will ensure and  safeguard against wrongful convictions of Trump and themselves .\n\nUnlike ordinary individuals jointly accused of crimes, lawyers are less likely to succumb to pressure or intimidation tactics. Unlike ordinary people lawyers love the courtroom; they have sufficient knowledge of the law and are competent to exonerate themselves of the indictment against them easily. Lawyers possessing knowledge of the law are less likely to be swayed by fear and more likely to stand their ground, ensuring that the truth prevails. Their steadfastness in the face of adversity strengthens the legal process and safeguards against potential miscarriages of justice. The complainants would have been better off isolating Trump so he would face the court alone but jointly indicting lawyers indirectly provides Trump with free legal advice and strengthens his defense. It is like trying to drown someone but you throw them overboard tied to professional swimmers equipped with floating devices.\n\nFirstly , let me state for the record that the sheer number of charges against Donald Trump, will earned him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. The carbon copies of the number of indictments highlight the political bias behind the indictments.. When a politician individual faces an excessive number of politically related charges brought by his opponents in the middle of an election , it becomes evident that political bias will be at play. This accumulation of charges cast doubt on the complainants' motives and their commitment to upholding justice impartially. The defense will likely highlight their political undertone, presenting it as evidence of a targeted approach against Trump rather than a genuine pursuit of justice. Furthermore, the 8 jointly indicted lawyers legal expertise provides them with the tools to mount a strong defense that can unravel the manipulative tactics employed by the complainants.\n\nBy indicting 8 lawyers alongside Trump, the complainants have exposed their own misjudgments. The defense will exploit these errors. The defense team will meticulously dissect their case, aiming to reveal procedural fraudulent errors in the election \ud83d\uddf3 , and also violations of their due legal process. Such revelations will significantly weaken the complainants' position and undermine their credibility, ultimately working to the advantage of Trump and his legal representatives.\n\nThe decision to indict 8 lawyers alongside Donald Trump will prove to be a tragic mistake by the manipulative complainants. \u201cGreedy puppy \ud83d\udc36 choke.\u201d\n\nBy indicting 8 experienced lawyers as Trump's co-conspirators, the government inadvertently expose that they have no  legal acumen because somebody among them should have been wise to advise the government that 8 lawyers strengthens the defense. These professionals have spent years honing their skills, establishing their professional reputations, and earning the trust of their clients. The mere association of these lawyers with Trump, albeit in a negative light, raises questions about the government's claims, as it implies that a billionaire as Trump is , he  sought legal advice from highly skilled experience professionals not criminals. This association inadvertently only strengthens Trump's defense.\n\nThe joint indictment of Trump and his 8 lawyers am sure will give rise to intriguing legal strategies that will go down in history books. With experienced lawyers facing similar charges as their former client, they now have the opportunity to mount a unified defense. This strategy allows them to synchronize their arguments, exploit potential loopholes, and present a united front against the prosecution. By doing so, they can create doubt and confusion, casting aspersions on the government's case and  weakening the government \u2018s position.\n\nInstead of solely indicting Trump which would have isolated him, and force him to seek a lawyer for his defense they afforded him to not even necessitate the need to hire an attorney although he still did hire attorneys but essentially Trump did not need to hire any lawyers because the lawyers he is jointly accuse with defense of themselves are sufficient to result in an acquittal for them all. Consequently, the joint indictment inadvertently reduces the weight of the accusations against Trump, ultimately strengthening his defense.\n\nThe inclusion of lawyers in the indictment opens the doors to propel the court to examine the defense evidence why they know the elections was rigged something the court had dismissed but now in these cases the court will be force to examine the evidence brought by the defendants . Experienced legal minds can meticulously present evidence that will exonerate them from the charges, to disqualify the case against them. By skillfully navigating the intricate landscape of the legal system, Trump's lawyers will raise legitimate concerns about due process in the election and the case brought against them, which will lead to the dismissal of charges.", "THE PRESIDENT CANNOT JUST DROP DOWN ON A ROPE INTO A DISASTER!

It is a forward-looking legal instrument which prohibits apartheid as a crime against humanity today and into the future, wherever it may exist.\u201d\n\nLynk said that Israel\u2019s military rule in the occupied Palestinian territory has been deliberately built with the intention of enduring facts on the ground \u2013 primarily through settlements and barricades \u2013 to demographically engineer a permanent, and illegal, Israeli sovereign claim over occupied territory, while confining Palestinians in smaller and more confined reserves of disconnected land.\u00a0\n\nThis has been accomplished in part through a long-standing series of inhuman(e) acts by the Israeli military towards the Palestinians that have been integral to the occupation, he said. He pointed to arbitrary and extra-judicial killings, torture, the denial of fundamental rights, an abysmal rate of child deaths, collective punishment, an abusive military court system, periods of intensive Israeli military violence in Gaza and home demolitions.\n\nLynk said a number of recent reports and opinions issued by respected Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organizations have come to the same conclusion on the practice of apartheid by Israel. He added that leading international personalities \u2013 including former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor and former Israeli Attorney General Michael Ben-Yair \u2013 have also all called this apartheid.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur said the international community bears much responsibility for this present state of affairs. \u201cFor more than 40 years, the UN Security Council and General Assembly have stated in hundreds of resolutions that Israel\u2019s annexation of occupied territory is unlawful, its construction of hundreds of Jewish settlements are illegal, and its denial of Palestinian self-determination breaches international law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Council and the Assembly have repeatedly criticized Israel for defying their resolutions. They have threatened consequences. But no accountability has ever followed. If the international community had truly acted on its resolutions 40 or 30 years ago, we would not be talking about apartheid today.\u201d\n\nTo end the practice of apartheid in the occupied Palestinian territory, the Special Rapporteur called on the international community to assemble an imaginative and vigorous menu of accountability measures to bring the Israeli occupation and its apartheid practices in the occupied Palestinian territory to a complete end.", "The penchant of Am's to int-\nllectualise, theorise, statem-\nents and actions instead of address the 'factualness' of said behaviours spoken or\nactions.

Prices were still okay before the pendemic & Ukraine, I buy some American goods & services. All Biden has to say is that he created jobs, he should forget about telling people they have more value for their money. I even compare prices in my country for food items and Americans are paying ridiculous prices. I checked the price of bread after 20 years in America and I was shocked the price didn't go up by more than $3 dollars, our bread price went up, after converting to your currency, our bread costs $1, it has always cost $1 dollar not matter which year, the only that changed was the currency, but things like potatoes went up. I guess some things get cheaper and some things don't. Long story short, people want prices to go down so that they have more value for their money, and we know there's low chances of that happening because they'll get slower profits. I haven't checked if electricity is cheaper in America. There's a lot I don't know about America's economy. I'm nothing more than a Foreign customer.

No offense but America has the most dysfunctional group of black & white people I've ever seen in the media. In real life they might be good people, depending on your definition of good.

Either the entirety will be recovered as Russian territory or the western part will be absorbed by Poland and the eastern part included with Russia.

The documents are material to the facts in both matters in ways that their classification of secrets is germane to the definition of charges in that hypothetical indictment.  Obviously, the reasons they include such \"sensitive\" nature among documents might imply the nature of all the facts which might relate the defendants in a conspiracy (like Meadows, possibly) to their credible motives for participating in a criminal enterprise.  If the crime is sedition, for example, then the contents of the secret material are the only way to explain the different between Presidential prerogative and the interests of the nation--or if the crime is mishandling national secrets then obstructing justice in retaining them, then the same substance of those central motives might prove exculpatory for defendants who had no knowledge about why the documents were moved and handled in a given way or which VIPs were treated to a look at Trump's exquisite dirt..\n\nThe unprecedented nature of this problem also begs for some direction from the courts about how the information might be discovered while the intelligence is not published (like war plans against Iran) to the detriment of national interests,  Those possibilities nay well affect how the possibilities for obstructing justice begin to look like extortion (like salacious information about President Macron) in the contexts of establishing some pattern in this criminal conduct.  What officials consider \"sensitive\" can easily convert into evidence that is tainted where a jury is not allowed to know the whole story because the defendant has really been above the law for the past six or seven years.
