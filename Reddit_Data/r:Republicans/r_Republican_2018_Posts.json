They say Trump has to rely on corrupt and unjust system of people. He is stupid and detrimental America's democracy. He stands for, represents, and does everything that goes against the foundations of liberty and justice for all. Like negro with his chains off he can not be trusted with nuclear warhead codes. So to undermine the negros plight is no different then what there doing to stop Donald from doing nothing but being himself and making good on his god damn campaign promises to America. They don't want see Donald win because he is underdog and man of the people. \n\nAll Donald is doing is staying true to himself and doing what said he was going do if he was elected. He done every single thing he promised to America that he believed would make it great again except gets these companies to return to US so people can have factoru jobs and refrain from doing globalism and putting america last. Or building that wall yet. He said he was going do away with Obamacare he did it. He said he going vet out there domestic terrorist and foreign terrorist he did it. Did again and again this last past year. \n\nHe has done everything he said was going do. CNN and MSNBC are the liars not Donald. Donald is stand up guy and role model for america. He has proven everything the resistors and media said as wrong. Donald is not criminal he is people champ and 2018 teflon don. They said he was in over his head on running the military and foreign policy. He has stayed true to his isolationist foreign policy and stay out ovmther countries affairs. He did not one time lose mind sending troops off to invade North Korea like George Bush did to Iraq. All I see is you negros and liberals being hypocrites. Doing exact things you excuse Donald over."},{"author":"bfwilley","created_utc":1516159004,"title":"White Supremacist, KKK Member Running for Office as Democrat","num_comments":23,"description":""},{"author":"charles_martel34","created_utc":1516184567,"title":"Democrat invited commie propaganda","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"DEYoungRepublicans","created_utc":1516194599,"title":"Republicans Must Lead Abortion Debate","num_comments":11,"description":""},{"author":"DEYoungRepublicans","created_utc":1516195247,"title":"Why We Are a Republic, Not a Democracy","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Pavegecko","created_utc":1516195759,"title":"The Exhausted Racism Charge","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"DEYoungRepublicans","created_utc":1516196733,"title":"Republicans give potential Trump challengers a free pass in 2018 - The GOP has failed to recruit strong candidates against a slate of potential Democratic reelection opponents.","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1516205600,"title":"Why would a white America be beneficial?","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"BarkeyForeman","created_utc":1516207178,"title":"How legit is the criticism that many current successful businessmen and investors inherited their wealth and\/or company or came from educated upper middle class backgrounds?

For a while I assumed it was the Republican\/Conservative party. However, my problem is that I cannot really research this party. Any google searching I do always brings up heavily Liberal sources. It seems to me also that reddit or social media is SEVERELY against anything conservative or republican, no matter what I do I cannot find anything to back claims or reasons why the Republican party chooses to do anything.\n\nI want to learn, and I really want to be able to decide for myself what I think, and the only way to do that is to research.\n\nOne thing I want to research is the Trump Administration. All I can read about on social media\/reddit\/google searches is how stupid Trump is, or how terrible his decisions are, and how inhumane he is.\n\nBut I can never find anything trying to defend him or his administration. I can never find any reliable sources that explain what Trump and his Administration are attempting to do with certain decisions or changes.\n\nWhere can I go to find this information? I don't want anything radical, just places I can go that will help to defend\/back the decisions that the Republicans make rather than attack them and claim that Trump\/Trumps Cabinet\/Republicans are stupid people who are unable to even think without being told what to do.\n\nThank you in advance.

Bush and supply-side economics: a 38-year old left-wing myth, based on some sloppy MEDIA coverage","num_comments":0,"description":"Hi all, new here. Great to find a subreddit by and for Republicans! :)\n\nThere's this persistent myth - arguably, outright lie - that George H.W. Bush called supply-side economics \"Voodoo Economics.\" In fact, \"**41\" NEVER said that about supply-side economics.** *He was referring to the Kemp-Roth tax cut proposal specifically and many of Reagan's economic policies in general* \\- more specifically, Reagan's promise of large, sweeping tax cuts that Reagan argued would end up increasing revenue, at the same time that Reagan was proposing a massive increase in the defense budget.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=edchtf9MS7g](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=edchtf9MS7g)\n\n\\^\\^Watch this entire clip - but specifically, right about 6 minutes in. Bush says, basically, **\"We've got to get the budget in balance by reducing expenditures, get in balance by a $20 billion SUPPLY-SIDE (Bush's emphasis) tax cut, and THEN begin to reduce rates.\"** Note that Bush then talks about the perils of endangering investor confidence, being \"already as low at it is\", with \"risking a massive increase in the budget deficit\" - and potentially, even higher inflation. This, more or less, was Bush's view.\n\nAs can also be seen in this clip, Bush argued that Reagan was overpromising with his proposals and that Reagan's extremely ambitious plans would unnecessarily increase the federal debt at a time when budget deficits, inflation, and unemployment were ALREADY out-of-control (no thanks to decades of reckless Democrat-driven government handouts, welfare policies, massive federal budgets that were wasteful, unaccountable, and prone to fraud and corruption - culminating in Jimmy Carter's utterly ruinous tenure).\n\nNow, Bush was mostly mistaken in his concerns, from my POV and judging by Reagan's record once in office, but I can totally understand his skepticism from the context of the times; Reagan was indeed taking some massive risks with his plans, but they definitely did pay off in the end, to everyone's benefit! :)\n\nGoing back to the title of my thread, though; the broader point is that some sloppy, bad journalism at the time can morph into this myth that Bush actually disagreed with Reagan on most issues, or that he opposed supply-side economics as a rule before he became Reagan's Vice President, or that indeed, \"Voodoo Economics\" was a dig at supply-side economics (which Reagan also subscribed to, obviously), not Reagan's SPECIFIC policy proposals or Reagan's endorsement of Kemp-Roth.\n\nRemember: never trust the conventional wisdom of the liberal elite opinion-makers and myth-makers. This is a good case study of that. They have it out for Republicans and conservatives in general, they want us to fail, and they'll use any piece of \"evidence\" to divide and conquer us - no matter how flimsy or untrue. Always be on guard against them.\n\n&#x200B;"},{"author":"TheLibertyEagle","created_utc":1540228689,"title":"Trump Administration Lays Groundwork For \u2018Two Genders Only\u2019 Law","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"TheLibertyEagle","created_utc":1540232308,"title":"30 Injured When Floor Collapsed During College Party","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Kannazhaga","created_utc":1540233078,"title":"Sean Hannity, Ted Cruz bring energy to rally to Beaumont","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"burdman1969","created_utc":1540233533,"title":"I don\u2019t see many women and children, looks a lot like 18-35 year old males .

Would it be more beneficial to make these drugs legal and tax them? We take almost all of the profits away from cartels. Less junkies dying from unclean drugs. More of a chance for junkies to seek help become clean and actually contribute to society. It just seems like we are running in circles and throwing millions of dollars at it.

Coming of age during the Reagan administration, I've considered myself a Republican most of my life. But now I've been perplexed concerning this new media avenue I've found myself in. Which begets the following questions.\n\n**  Certain boards do not allow articles from certain news outlets. The best example I've found was r\/democrats does not allow articles from Fox News or the New York Post. (I'm sure they disallow more and they are not the only board that does this)\n \n- - Does this board dictate the same rules? Do you allow articles from all forms of the MSM? \n\nIt seems discussion regarding issues which are polar to a particular board would be welcome and enlightening. Plus, searching for facts or criticism against a particular group allows context and further understanding in one's position. I don't  believe I could bring myself to outright eliminate someone else's views because they don't match my own. \n\n**  Which brings me to Rule 4 on this board - \"do not post anti-Republican submissions or comments\". \n\n- -  Can we not question an article or vett an issue published in the MSM even though the article in question is critical of Republican ideas?\n\nIt would seem the best place to express ideas, pass on facts or widen understanding of a particular issue would be to post and debate defamatory publications. Every person may align themselves with a specific political idea or party, but each has their own version of morals and scruples. Examining all of those foundations can bring on a topic or view not thought of. \n\nI thank you all in advance for allowing such a sophomoric question regarding Reddit rules. You help in this matter is greatly appreciated."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1542130591,"title":"Left wing shenanigans.","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1542131112,"title":"Im calling on Nancy pelosi.

I grew up in Brooklyn and New Jersey when it was still an american place to live. We enjoyed the diners, the plentiful jobs and remember a time when a commoner would still speak English. Everything is different today. Slowly and slowly all the old native New Yorkers have left. Our towns today are runned down due to rapid immigration, ghetto thugs moving in and quite frankly they have no manners. The property taxes are off the charts due to many illegals sending their kids to school here- and of course we have to foot the tax bill. The politicians here don\u2019t care either, they just want to fill their pockets. Plus if you\u2019re white male here- and a conservative- then you get a sense of feeling you don\u2019t belong. Alienation is very apparent. There are very few whites left in NJ at this point. At my work in nyc where more and more ppl are moving from California\/San Francisco- things are changing  on daily basis. There is a clear divide where I work.  Many of my co-workers have left due to disrespectful new millennials..we are considering moving out to another state. I was wondering if you guys could comment about another city which might be comparative to living standards in north jersey\/nyc. Pay cut is fine, at this point we just need a nice homely city\/suburb- where people are polite, jobs are abundant, and starting a new family is feasible. Even swing cities and states would work.

This is my first post in this subreddit and I couldn\u2019t be more embarrassed that my school offers a course on impeaching Donald Trump. Apparently this is the second semester in a row they\u2019re offering the course and just to give you a better idea of what the class is about, this is what the class details say: \n\nSan Diego State University is offering a one-unit course in March called \u201cTrump: Impeachment, Removal or Conviction?\u201d taught by Professor John Joseph Cleary.\n\n\u201cFocus will be on the two constitutional grounds: impeachment and removal (25th Amendment), and the possible charges of the independent counsel,\u201d the course description reads in part.\n\nThe class will cover \u201cgrounds for impeachment, removal, or indictment\u201d such as \u201cconflict of interests, foreign emoluments, climate change, racism, religious bias, improper influence, nepotism, and a host of crimes, including conspiracy, false statements, and obstruction of justice\u201d\n\nI\u2019m actually at a loss for words, I don\u2019t know how a college institution, let alone SDSU, would back such a painstakingly obvious biased class. I am very disappointed in my college for allowing lies and false accusations to be spread in a legitimate class. I have always been scared of teachers exerting their political opinions on kids without them realizing they\u2019re being influenced, but for a \u201cteacher\u201d to be suggesting and teaching that Donald Trump should be impeached without any evidence or fair representation of both sides is ludicrous and dangerous for young adults who are supposed to be forming their own beliefs at this stage in their lives. Especially when it\u2019s being offered as curriculum. I just feel bad for all the sheep getting brainwashed at this school, yet I get so angry because of them. Half of the students aren\u2019t adept enough to do their own research and form their own opinion. Instead they opt for the force feeding of pure bullshit, compliments of the left.  Is it so hard to ask for people to just WAKE UP and start paying attention to what is actually going on around them. Sorry for the rambling and kind of jumping around from point to point. Just thoroughly disappointed in the growing gap between these two \u201cpolitical parties\u201d and the deceit fueling the separation.

So far, open-borders advocates have flooded the federal register with their comments in opposition to the proposal.

A recent report from the Center for Immigration Studies found that 63% of non-citizen households, approximately 4.6 million, use welfare.\n* The Migration Policy Institute confirms this finding. According to its research, 47.2% of non-citizens receive at least one type of the four major public benefits -- cash assistance, SSI, food stamps, and Medicaid\/CHIP.\n* The average immigrant household costs U.S. taxpayers $6,234 each year in federal welfare benefits.\n\n**ABOUT THE 'PUBLIC CHARGE' RULE**\n\nThe administration's proposed rule simply strengthens the already existing rule that defines what welfare programs USCIS can consider in determining if a green card applicant is likely to become a public charge.\n\nThe existing rule is limited to cash assistance and institutionalization for long-term care. The [proposed rule](http:\/\/hub.numbersusa.com\/route\/8\/5c0579bf74e18a7c11ae6e81\/1721505\/9?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001) would include food stamps, public housing, and Medicaid, among other programs.\n\nNew analysis of government data from the Center for Immigration Studies finds that 63% of non-citizen headed households access some form of welfare.

If the identity of any of the politicians NSS has worked for come to light, the game is over and NSS can't answer as straightforward as they'd like. And believe me it is figuratively killing me not being able to tell you who that is so please don't make it worse. If you have ever wondered what it's like to play in the big leagues of politics, now is your chance to find out.\n\nOne final note:\n\nWe would like to extend our hand to other republican leaning subs to come take a gander and participate. We don't mind people advertising this but we do ask that you not post this on sub that are in direct opposition to republican values or view republicans in a negative light. Such actions will be viewed as attempting to brigade the AMA. When in doubt, please ask us mods first.\n\n\nWe will be using this post as a question workshop all week where us mods will help work through wordings of questions.

I'm pro-American, and as such, support Trump. \n\nI'm an SF resident and read the PolitiFacts article last night regarding a meme floating around showing a mansion, being used to critique Pelosi's anti-wall stance. Essentially saying \"Why do you live in a walled community if walls are immoral?\". Everyone here knows Pelosi lived in the only walled community in SF for many years. Its in their marketing, its in her books, and its part of SF lore for most. The place was even originally built for whites to keep minorities out. So I decided to comment that they were correct the specific SF mansion shown was not hers, but she did in fact live in a walled community right down the street and it was a bit extreme to label the meme with their most falsifying qualifier. I saw the article using semantics to narrate their claims unjustly, and gave them the benefit of the doubt at first. That was until I was dismissed.\n\nWould I choose arguing about Pelosi once living in a walled community as my hill to die on? Hell no. Its stupid and Americans should live where they choose, walls or not. I only share this so you guys can see as I did, there was ZERO research in this article, and the content of which becomes more and more based on nothing or hearsay, maybe because their sources were a facebook post and fly-by-night news website. This is supposed to be a bipartisan fact-checking site, and they dismiss me with 'my sources say'. Data talks. I didn't save a copy of the article last night, but if anyone has a way to access a cached version somehow, I'd be curious to see if they silently changed the article.

But the truth is it isn't a waste at all. 5B dollars is not much at all considering the effects that that money will go to. \n\n**The Effects** \n\nIllegal immigrants cost us 135B dollars a year according to the U.S taxpayers. We only get back about 19B dollars worth of taxes from them, money being wasted on people who either illegally crossed or overstayed. If we can get this wall up than we can cut the budget of immigration and put it into other things like homeless veterans or homeless citizens, America first. \n\n**Why It Should Be Built**\n\nConsidering how our money is being wasted on aliens we need the wall for that reason too. Not all of it is people who crossed the border on foot but a good portion is. A lot of drugs are being smuggled into the U.S by crossing the border a year. Illegal immigrants are 2x more likely to commit crimes than a U.S citizen, another reason why we need the wall.\n\n**Other Solutions For Immigration**\n\nAbide by the law, don't overstay your visa. A lot of immigrants overstay visas and we end up paying their welfare and they give us little to nothing in return. We need to deport the ones who don't abide by the law and who overstay visas. If you want a opportunity in the U.S do it legally. But I do think that the process should be quicker so people should have a good opportunity here, but not illegally"},{"author":"RightSideNews","created_utc":1545350968,"title":"Undisclosed Seth Rich\/Guccifer 2.0 Comments Exist, but what are they?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"flyntlarry","created_utc":1545351554,"title":"Is The Federal Reserve Actually TRYING To Cause A Stock Market Crash?","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"Ericb2020","created_utc":1545353106,"title":"US goverment shutdown!! you won't believe what Trump just did","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Ericb2020","created_utc":1545354479,"title":"Top Clinton Donors INDICTED For Defrauding The Pentagon Of over $1.4 Billion","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"Ted-the-Pirate","created_utc":1545355503,"title":"Tragedies like this should not happen, but I don't understand how state laws like this are even possible.
