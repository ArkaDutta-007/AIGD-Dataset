With the holidays and the Mods having to deal with a rather large increase in concern trolling it was nessesary that we delay these discussions so we could feel CIA on th the matters at hand.  It seems that we are getting back out of the woods so without further a due \n\nWith the coming of the new President, a few have been asking about his proposed policies. So what we'd like to do is have a weekly discussion about his [\"First Hundred Days contract\"](https:\/\/assets.donaldjtrump.com\/_landings\/contract\/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf) plan found [here](http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/11\/09\/501451368\/here-is-what-donald-trump-wants-to-do-in-his-first-100-days)\n\nEach week(with a month pause here and there), we will discuss one item of the plan. Here are the links to previous discussions\n\n* Week One: [Term Limits on Congress](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5cebto\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Two: [Federal Hiring Freeze](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5dnz2h\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Three:[for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5etfkh\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Four: [Lobbyists Restrictions after Government Service;](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5g3ou2\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Five: [Renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the Deal under Article 2205](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5hg74d\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Six:  [Announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5iqhl3\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\nA few rules before we begin, this isn't a discussion on the feasibility of the plan, it's allowed but it cannot be the focus of your post. Instead, we'd like to discuss what the effects\/affects both short term and long term will be. What are the potential drawbacks? and what are the potential benefits? \n\nWe ask that you approach this topic from the point of view of a scholar. When making statements that require sources please include them without someone having to request them.\n\n**This week's topic**, is a proposal to protect American (and really the world's economy)\n\n> THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator;\n\nThis is one of 7 actions Mr Trump has outlined to protect American workers\n\n in [the Republican Platform](https:\/\/prod-cdn-static.gop.com\/media\/documents\/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf) there is an entire subsection devoted to \"U.S. Leadership in the Asian Pacific\" I **strongly** urge everyone to read before making comments about our realtions with tawain and other pacific nations.\n\nthis is just the first paragraph to get you started.\n\n> We are a Pacific nation with economic, military, and cultural ties to all the countries of the oceanic rim  and  treaty  alliances  with  Japan,  South  Korea,  Australia,  the  Philippines,  and  Thailand.    With  them, we look toward the establishment of human rights for the people of North Korea. We urge the government of China to recognize the inevitability of  change  in  the  Kim  family\u2019s  slave  state  and,  for  everyone\u2019s  safety  against  nuclear  disaster,  to  hasten  positive  change  on  the  Korean  peninsula.The  United  States  will  continue  to  demand  the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of  North  Korea\u2019s  nuclear  weapons  program  with  full  accounting  of  its  proliferation  activities.  We  also pledge to counter any threats from the North Korean regime\n\n\nGlobalist and\/or Neo Conservatives are typically the ones most in favor of free trade agreements.  Historically, Republicans like Bush, and Reagan have been pro free trade.\n\nNationalists and hard line conservatives tend to view free trade agreements as a negative as free trade agreements don't tend to hold other nations accountable when said nations don't play by the same labor rules as American companies.  This is why the current platform addresses this issue like so\n\n> We cannot allow foreign governments to limit American access to their markets while stealing our designs, patents, brands, know-how, and technology. We cannot **allow China to continue its currency manipulation**, exclusion of U.S. products from government purchases, and subsidization of Chinese companies to thwart American imports.  \n\n> The current Administration\u2019s way of dealing with these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual\nsurrender.\n\n> Republicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it. A Republican president will insist on parity in trade and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate.\n\n\n So there is somewhat of a \"right\" answer here.  As such I would like to remind people that this isn't meant to be a bash trump fest but to be a serious discussion about the impacts and effects of this proposal.  Not all of these policies will be like this but this one is.  Constructive Criticisms is and has always been the rule here.\n\nFor many of these topics, we will be reaching out to experts.

For someone in the 25% tax bracket, if you count both their and the employer's share of the payroll tax, this is nearly a 40% tax rate on salary income.  I think this creates bad incentives in the economy as a whole: it disincentivizes work and incentivizes rising health care costs.\n\nThe ACA has one aspect that partially addresses this, and also raises revenue, by taxing [\"cadillac insurance plans\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cadillac_insurance_plan), which amounts to be ones with individual premiums exceeding $850 a month.\n\nI'd be curious to hear whether people here agree with this provision of the ACA, as well as whether people would support expanding this to plans with lower premiums as well.  Some thoughts:\n\n* I think it's problematic that the cutoff isn't indexed by age.  An $850\/month premium for a 20-year-old would be incredibly luxurious, whereas for someone in their 80's, not so much.\n\n* One option for expanding this taxation would be expand it to tax *all health insurance benefits* and then take the added revenue and use it to lower other taxes, like the income and payroll tax.  I am personally a huge opponent of the payroll tax, as it disincentivizes work, both employment and contracting, so if I were to propose something, it would be taxing all benefits, and taking the additional revenue to lower the payroll tax as much as possible. I think a shift in tax burden away from work and towards health care benefits would have a positive effect on the economy overall.\n\n* This tax has been very unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans.  It has been especially unpopular among labor unions, as they often push for high-benefit plans that are more likely to be hit by this tax.  For people who support this type of tax, how can people fight the disconnect between what might be good for the economy and people in the long-run, and people's short-term aversion to a new tax?\n\nI'd be curious too to hear if any people oppose this tax on grounds more based on Republican \/ conservative ideologies.  All the arguments against it I've heard have been fussing by labor unions, or generic, non-partisan critiques.  None of these arguments have convinced me that this sort of tax is any more problematic or harmful than income or payroll tax (especially relative to payroll tax).  I have never heard a single argument against this tax on grounds relating to fiscal responsibility or economic incentives."},{"author":"The_seph_i_am","created_utc":1484782382,"title":"Let's Stop Pretending The Obama Administration Was 'Scandal Free'","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1484786339,"title":"Nikki Haley departs sharply from Trump on a range of foreign policy issues, including Russia","num_comments":6,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1484786643,"title":"Trump inauguration\u2019s \u2018Cabinet dinner\u2019 offers access for cash","num_comments":4,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"ThePoliticalHat","created_utc":1484795024,"title":"Donald Trump picks Sonny Perdue as Secretary of Agriculture","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"The_seph_i_am","created_utc":1484797518,"title":"U.S. antitrust agency sues Qualcomm over patent licensing","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"ThePoliticalHat","created_utc":1484797749,"title":"Liberal nightmare: Trump could appoint half federal judiciary","num_comments":25,"description":""},{"author":"ek2512aek2512a","created_utc":1484800432,"title":"The Truth Behind Women's March in Washington","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"PatrioticFront","created_utc":1484807094,"title":"What Trump Is Throwing Out the Window","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"metrohs","created_utc":1484816428,"title":"Starting a new conservative blog, and looking for assistance....","num_comments":3,"description":"As described in the title, I am starting a conservative website\/blog, and was looking for someone to possibly partner with me\/write with me on the site.

If you're new hear we will take any questions you may have about this sub here.","num_comments":50,"description":"Correction to title: If you're new here*\n\n\nOrdinarily we reserve this kind of discussion for r\/metarepublican however considering the unprecedented amount of interest we've gotten in the sub as of late, this seems needed.\n\nWe also saw a near 500% increase in unique page views.\n\nSince there are a lot of first time visitors to this little slice of reddit, I strongly encourage everyone to read the rules.\n\n**Our Purpose**\n\nThis sub devoted to allowing republicans a place to discuss republican issues.  If you do not view yourself as a republican please understand we view you as a guest, please do not outwear your welcome.  Please follow and abide by the rules.\n\n**Rule 5**\n\nSome may be wondering what we define as leftist.  To be honest, there is no black and white answer.  Leftist is normally viewed as perspective that is skewed towards giving a liberal party and its ideals and principles advantages over more right sided (on the political spectrum) ideologies.  Usually this is what we refer to as leftist agendas or narratives. An example of a leftist comment would be advocating socialism (in most any form). \n\n**Rule 4**\n\nWhile we allow constructive criticisms of Republicans that cannot be the only content of your post and criticisms must be made from the perspective of a republican.  This is up to any of the mods judgment as to whether or not it is considered \"anti-republican\".  \n\n**By what bar do the mods measure if something is \"Anti-Republican\"?**\n\nMany traditional viewpoints are well established in the Republican party but views and traditions change over time.  That is why it is so important to read through the [Republican Party Platform.](https:\/\/prod-cdn-static.gop.com\/media\/documents\/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf)  If you are arguing against something listed in that document it is likely to be viewed as anti-republican.  This is not the end all be all but it is pretty definitive.\n\n**I ain't got time to read that!**\n\nThen this isn't the sub for you.  If you are looking for click-bait and easy to read articles that basically hand feed you what  opinion you should have, you are in the wrong sub.  We operate under *rules 1, 2, and 6* for very specific reasons.  This sub is devoted to providing WELL INFORMED **discussions**.  We do not allow heated arguments.  First and foremost, debate the message not the person.  If you are calling someone an idiot or seeking to undermine the position of someone that disagrees with you by insulting the person, then you aren't going to do well here.  To that end, we introduced rule 6 because we do not want to be misled by false narratives.\n\n**How can the party of FREE SPEECH advocate the creation of a \"safe space?\"**\n\nThere are several counter points to be made to this argument.  The primary one is the topic of this sub is \"Republican concepts, principles, and beliefs\"  introducing anti-republican concepts is quite literally off topic.  \n\nu\/aboardthegravyboat recently gave an excellent [analogy regarding the answer to this question](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5owlv6\/if_you_are_not_a_republican_then_you_are_a_guest\/dcmrnaa\/)\n\n>Could you imagine if, due to popularity of the sub and the general leanings of Reddit at large, \/r\/NFL was completely overrun with people who really hate football? Even if they were respectful, it wouldn't really be a great community for football fans if pro-football comments got consistently downvoted and anti-football comments consistently rise to the top.\n\n> *People from any part of the sports spectrum should be welcome here*\n\n> They should definitely be welcome somewhere or even be able to visit. But when baseball-loving football-non-fans become the majority, it's hardly a football community anymore.\n\nTo add to this.  Even football fans have issues with the NFL and we as mods want to allow that.  But unfortunately such criticisms invite liberals to start advocating their policies and that is where the mods will intervene. \n\n**down vote\/up vote is not for guest's**\n\nThis sub is designed to be a location for republicans to actually discuss republican issues without being drowned out by the banter often seen in subs like r\/politics.  The reddit community leans very heavy liberal and isn't really very politically minded. (especially when talking about United States Politics).  As evident by several polls\n\n* http:\/\/www.journalism.org\/2016\/02\/25\/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences\/\n\n* http:\/\/brandongaille.com\/31-fascinating-reddit-demographics\/\n\n* http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2015\/07\/11\/reddit-is-not-the-front-page-of-the-internet.html\n\n(thanks to u\/ibiteyou for [these](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5oynar\/the_45th_president_of_the_united_states_of_america\/dcnpqpb\/))\n\n As such, it is important to point out a unwritten rule of reddit.  If you aren't apart of this sub (i.e. a republican) do not up-vote or down vote just because you agree or disagree with a subject.  This messes up our front page and pretty soon we start looking like r\/politics.... we don't want that.\n\n**Concern Trolling**\n\n**How can any SANE republican support Trump?**\n\nThis is an example of what we deem \"concern trolling\".  We define concern trolling like so...When someone tries to get around our 4th and 5th rule by starting with something that seems republican and then attempts to push their own anti-republican\/leftist agenda in the question.\n\nBy stressing SANE in the title above the poster is already attempting to imply that it is INSANE to support the current Republican President putting republicans that support trump already on the defensive.\n\nA way to ask this question without getting labeled a \"concern troll\" is to remove any bias from the question.  \n\nExample *\"what are reasons to support trump?\"*\n\n**President Trump Criticisms**\n\nAdditionally, while we are on the subject of President Trump lets also mention this...  Mr Trump is not the **only** face of the Republican Party.  Many of the mods here did not support Mr Trump during the nomination and there are [MANY aspects of the republican party,](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PoliticalDiscussion\/comments\/4dja7w\/how_many_sub_parties_make_up_the_gop\/)  But HE IS THE PRESIDENT and any attempt to undermine his legitimacy will be met with resistance.  And if that is the only thing you do on this sub is post criticisms of trump, you will find yourself banned pretty quickly.\n\nWe do not care what disastrous\/outrageous thing he just tweeted.  It is only a lateral step from celebrity gossip in most instances.   Nor do we care about how the Russian gov \"hacked the election\".  These are viewed as leftist narratives and will be removed as such.\n\nThe Republican Party OWNS the federal government and the majority of state governments at the moment.  Republicans should be celebrating this.  We should be so honored that majority of the United States has put such trust in us.  There is so much going on in politics.  \n\nIf you haven't had a chance to read through our weekly discussion about trumps 1st 100 days in office please do so. There are literally hundreds of very important decisions to be had.  Please lets not let us get distracted by every shinny orange and gold turd shaped object that comes our way.\n\nPoint is Welcome to r\/republican, welcome to adulthood, welcome to the future of the United States for the next decade or so.  If you like us great!  if you don't well... that's great too.. I guess..."},{"author":"Marvinkmooneyoz","created_utc":1484947741,"title":"Will the GOP house and senate go along with the president?","num_comments":29,"description":"Usually, the party that the president belongs to generally go with his plans.

So what we'd like to do is have a weekly discussion about his [\"First Hundred Days contract\"](https:\/\/assets.donaldjtrump.com\/_landings\/contract\/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf) plan found [here](http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/11\/09\/501451368\/here-is-what-donald-trump-wants-to-do-in-his-first-100-days)\n\nEach week(with a month pause here and there), we will discuss one item of the plan. Here are the links to previous discussions\n\n* Week One: [Term Limits on Congress](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5cebto\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Two: [Federal Hiring Freeze](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5dnz2h\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Three:[for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5etfkh\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Four: [Lobbyists Restrictions after Government Service;](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5g3ou2\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Five: [Renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the Deal under Article 2205](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5hg74d\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Six:  [Announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5iqhl3\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Seven: [Direct the Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5o54tp\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n\nA few rules before we begin, this isn't a discussion on the feasibility of the plan, it's allowed but it cannot be the focus of your post. Instead, we'd like to discuss what the effects\/affects both short term and long term will be. What are the potential drawbacks? and what are the potential benefits? \n\nWe ask that you approach this topic from the point of view of a scholar. When making statements that require sources please include them without someone having to request them.\n\n**This week's topic**, is a proposal to protect American (and really the world's economy)\n\n> Fifth, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\n\nThis is one of 7 actions Mr Trump has outlined to protect American workers\n\n in [the Republican Platform](https:\/\/prod-cdn-static.gop.com\/media\/documents\/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf) there is an entire sections devoted to a \"new era in energy\"\n\nthis is just few of the paragraph's to get you started.\n\n> The Democratic Party\u2019s energy policy can be summed up in a slogan currently popular among its activists: \u201ckeep it in the ground.\u201d Keeping energy in the earth will keep jobs out of reach of those who need them most. For low-income Americans, expensive energy means colder homes in the winter and hotter homes in the summer, less mobility in employment, and higher food prices. The current Administration, and particularly its EPA, seems \nnot to care. Its Clean Power Plan \u2014 the centerpiece of the President\u2019s war on coal \u2014 has been stayed by the Supreme Court. We will do away with it altogether. The Democratic Party does not understand that coal is an abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource. Those who mine it and their families should be protected from the Democratic Party\u2019s radical anti- coal agenda. \n\n\n....\n\n> We support the development of all forms of energy that are marketable in a free economy without subsidies, including coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power, and hydropower. A federal judge has struck down the BLM\u2019s rule on hydraulic fracturing and we support upholding this decision. We respect the states\u2019 proven ability to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing, methane emissions, and horizontal drilling, and we will end the Administration\u2019s disregard of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act with respect to the long-term storage of nuclear waste. We encourage the cost-effective development of renewable energy sources \u2014 wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, geothermal, and tidal energy \u2014 by private capital. The United States is overwhelmingly dependent on China and other nations for rare earth and other hardrock minerals. These minerals are critical to advanced technology, renewable energy, and defense manufacturing. We support expediting the permitting process for mineral production on public lands. We support lifting restrictions to allow responsible development of nuclear energy, including research into alternative processes like thorium nuclear energy. \n\nSomething I want to point out in all of this.  The party platform is centered on removing subsidies period.  It's not about ensuring pollution gets a foothold again.  It isn't anti-solar or anti-wind.  \n\n\n So there is somewhat of a \"right\" answer here.  As such I would like to remind people that this isn't meant to be a bash trump fest but to be a serious discussion about the impacts and effects of this proposal.  Not all of these policies will be like this but this one is.  Constructive Criticisms is and has always been the rule here.\n\nFor many of these topics, we will be reaching out to experts. If you know of some that would be willing to do a Q&A on these topics, please contact the if you happen to see someone you don't recognize on here that could be why.

So what we'd like to do is have a weekly discussion about his [\"First Hundred Days contract\"](https:\/\/assets.donaldjtrump.com\/_landings\/contract\/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf) plan found [here](http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/11\/09\/501451368\/here-is-what-donald-trump-wants-to-do-in-his-first-100-days)\n\nEach week(with a month pause here and there), we will discuss one item of the plan. Here are the links to previous discussions\n\n* Week One: [Term Limits on Congress](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5cebto\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Two: [Federal Hiring Freeze](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5dnz2h\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Three:[for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5etfkh\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Four: [Lobbyists Restrictions after Government Service;](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5g3ou2\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Five: [Renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the Deal under Article 2205](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5hg74d\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Six:  [Announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5iqhl3\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Seven: [Direct the Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5o54tp\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n* Week Eight: The lifting of restrictions on American Energy Reserves (please dont down vote, this is an inportant discussion)(https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Republican\/comments\/5ph99c\/weekly_discussion_thread_president_elect_trumps\/)\n\n\nA few rules before we begin, this isn't a discussion on the feasibility of the plan, it's allowed but it cannot be the focus of your post. Instead, we'd like to discuss what the effects\/affects both short term and long term will be. What are the potential drawbacks? and what are the potential benefits? \n\nWe ask that you approach this topic from the point of view of a scholar. When making statements that require sources please include them without someone having to request them.\n\n**This week's topic**, is a proposal to protect American (and really the world's economy)\n\n> Fifth, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\n\nThis is one of 7 actions Mr Trump has outlined to protect American workers\n\n in [the Republican Platform](https:\/\/prod-cdn-static.gop.com\/media\/documents\/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf) the United Nations is mentioned several times.  One of the first instances is when discussing the UN panel of Climate change.  It is the opinion of the Republican Party that the panel has moved beyond the scope of the unbiased scientific methods and has become a political mechanism.\n\nthis is just few of the paragraph's to get you started.\n\n> Information concerning a changing climate, especially projections into the long-range future, must be based on dispassionate analysis of hard data. We will enforce that standard throughout the executive branch, among civil servants and presidential appointees alike. The United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a political mechanism, not an unbiased scientific institution. Its unreliability is reflected in its intolerance toward scientists and others who dissent from its orthodoxy. We will evaluate its recommendations accordingly. We reject the agendas of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, which represent only the personal commitments of their signatories; no such agreement can be binding upon the United States until it is submitted to and ratified by the Senate.\rWe demand an immediate halt to U.S. funding for the U.N.\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in accordance with the 1994 Foreign Relations Authorization Act. That law pro- hibits Washington from giving any money to \u201cany affiliated organization of the United Nations\u201d which grants Palestinians membership as a state. There is no ambiguity in that language. It would be illegal for the President to follow through on his intention to provide millions in funding for the UNFCCC and hundreds of millions for its Green Climate Fund.\n\n\n So there is somewhat of a \"right\" answer here.  As such I would like to remind people that this isn't meant to be a bash trump fest but to be a serious discussion about the impacts and effects of this proposal.  Not all of these policies will be like this but this one is.  Constructive Criticisms is and has always been the rule here.\n\nFor many of these topics, we will be reaching out to experts. If you know of some that would be willing to do a Q&A on these topics, please contact the if you happen to see someone you don't recognize on here that could be why.  Say hi, hopefully we don't frighten them off.\n\n\nLastly.  The environment is a serious trigger word for many.  I fully understand and appreciate this but please keep this civil.  If you disagree with the policy, fine but please don't downvote because you disagree with a comment or policy.  Instead try to explain, why a free(ish) market should care.  As long as it's thoughful and well cited and from a republican point of view it will not be removed."},{"author":"MCButtersnaps","created_utc":1485658980,"title":"ACLU Challenges Trump's Immigration Ban In Federal court, secures temporary injunction","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"GotchMaster","created_utc":1485660006,"title":"When you voted for Trump, is this first week of office what you predicted?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"lingben","created_utc":1485660070,"title":"Nobody Wanted to Take Us In: The Story of Jared Kushner\u2019s Family, and Mine","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"rhydon_my_steelix","created_utc":1485660306,"title":"steve Bannon added to National security council, DNI and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff removed","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"brandonkirk","created_utc":1485662930,"title":"Blame it on the Abe, Fake news, Flu, Russia, straight men, alt right","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Shitposter123456789","created_utc":1485662998,"title":"Trump Gives Stephen Bannon Access to the National Security Council","num_comments":84,"description":""},{"author":"WhiteLegion","created_utc":1485669902,"title":"INSANE!

Thank you.\n\n\u201cHollywood\u201d and \u201cReal America\u201d\u2014an essay\n\nI\u2019m going to start this off by saying I\u2019m an admitted Hollywood Liberal.  I live in LA, I work in television, I voted Democratic in the last few elections, and I someday hope to own a plug-in vehicle.\n\nSo often on TV and in social media, I hear people (often on the conservative side) say that \u201cHollywood\u201d is not part of \u201cReal America\u201d.  That people in LA are just \u201cout of touch with actual Americans\u201d.  That people who work in Hollywood are only \"playing make-believe\u201d and therefore don\u2019t understand the true struggles out there in the rest of the country, and should just keep their political opinions to themselves.\n\nI just want to take a moment to speak about some of these myths and the Hollywood that I know.\n\n\u2014\u201cHollywood isn\u2019t part of Real America\u201d\u2014Here\u2019s an interesting aspect of Los Angeles: nobody is from here.  It\u2019s a town of \u201ctransplants\u201d, people who come from all over just to work in entertainment.  I grew up in a working class town in New Jersey, spent my high school years in a near-rural suburb outside Chicago, and I went to college in the middle of Philadelphia.  At my office, there\u2019s a large map of the US in the break room, where everyone has signed where they are from.  The map is filled left-to-right with people\u2019s names.  We may live in LA, but our families are located throughout the country, and we care deeply about them.\n\n\u2014\u201cPeople in LA are out of touch and don\u2019t understand true American struggles\u201d\u2014I admit Los Angeles can feel a bit of a bubble.  The weather is always pleasant, the fruit is always fresh; it\u2019s easy to see the sunny-side of things when you live here.  But to say that we don\u2019t understand the American struggle is just wrong.  Hollywood is not just actors and actresses sitting on piles of money.  Hollywood is a single-mother makeup artist who doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019s going to pick up her kid from school later.  Hollywood is a cameraman who isn\u2019t sure when his next job is going to be, because he\u2019s a freelancer working paycheck-to-paycheck.  Hollywood is an assistant editor with a bad cough, still working to meet deadlines because often there is no sick pay, and rarely health benefits.\n\nAlso, as someone who has edited countless raw hours of reality television, I have seen Real America.  I worked on a documentary show featuring Army wives on a base in Alaska, worrying for their husbands stationed in Afghanistan, seeing the pain and fear in their eyes.  I worked on a show featuring two cops, one black, one white, as they bridged the racial divide as partners fighting animal cruelty in Montgomery, Alabama.  I worked on a show about a young 20-something woman building her own company from the ground-up with over 30 employees.  I also worked on \u201cPimp My Ride\u201d, but that\u2019s a different story.\n\n\u2014\u201cPeople in LA just play \u2018make-believe\u2019, their opinions don\u2019t matter\u201d\u2014Ok, acting is \u201cmake-believe\u201d on face value, but good acting also understands human emotion, pain, love, fear, etc.  But that\u2019s not my point.  My point is: how does anyone\u2019s profession qualify them for political opinion?  Does being a doctor give more weight to an opinion versus a plumber?  Does being a professor of economics outweigh being a bank teller?  Americans understand the America they know and surround themselves with, and form their opinions based on that.  And everyone can have an opinion, even if it\u2019s wrong or misguided.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to point at Meryl Streep, or Sean Penn, or Clint Eastwood, or Jon Voight, and say, \u201cwell, what do they know? They\u2019re just celebrities.\u201d  But they\u2019re just trying to get an opinion out there to as many people as they can, just as anyone does on social media, just as I am with this essay.  I hope someone reads this and gets a better understanding of \u201cHollywood\u201d just as I always hope to understand all of America.  Thank you.\n\n"},{"author":"Yosoff","created_utc":1485726802,"title":"Refugee Madness: Trump Is Wrong, But His Liberal Critics Are Crazy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"RealRandyRoss","created_utc":1485731424,"title":"FBI Raids CDC Headquarters with CDC Whistle Blower?","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"IBiteYou","created_utc":1485731860,"title":"Donald Trump\u2019s Refugee Executive Order: No Muslim Ban -- Separating Fact from Hysteria","num_comments":22,"description":""},{"author":"Yosoff","created_utc":1485734173,"title":"President Donald J.

I am a republican through and through. Texas born and raised tax hating gun toting republican. \n\nBut I am also an avid gamer and I am once again worried about net neutrality. I have heard both sides of the argument on this and frankly I have to agree with the left here.\n\nBut maybe it is because I am missing something. From what I have heard ISPs want to install a fast lane, or install a gate on your modem, and make you pay more for faster internet service. Personally I do not see ISPs adding new infrastructure as this is VERY VERY VERY expensive. They resist and resist and resit this so much that they lobby to pass laws allowing them to keep geographic monopolies. \n\nPersonally I want to be able to play games at 1gb connection and without having to pay an extra price for my internet connection. And I do not want data limits. I am a network tech and someone who has worked for ISPs in the past. I can 100 percent guarantee you that there are zero benefits to data limits outside of the ISP making more money. \n\nIf you want an analogy. People like to liken it to a reservoir of water. When you drain the water it is out. This is false. \n\nThe better analogy is an airtight room with a pipe leading outside to provide air for the inhabitants. IF too many people are breathing in the room, the pipe is unable to provide enough oxygen. So you have to build another pipe. \n\nBut ISPs do not want to do this. They want to tell people to breath less IE use less data. Anyone who is a gamer will tell you that gaming can sometimes take up MASSIVE amounts of data. Contrary to what ISPs report, an ISP does not pay for data. Whether you download 1 gigabyte or 1 terabyte it cost your ISP roughly the same price. \n\nEdit: Price difference is less than 5 dollars in electricity here. \n\nSo is there a major point I am missing here outside of \"we dont want the govt to have control and tax us?\" My ISP bill has tax added on to it. (This may just be state tax but not too sure.) Seriously what am I missing here and why is net neutrality such a bad thing?"},{"author":"DEYoungRepublicans","created_utc":1485873181,"title":"McConnell: If GOP unites, we will win","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"mbarnar","created_utc":1485873692,"title":"Report: Trump halted $181 billion in regulatory costs on first day in office","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"DEYoungRepublicans","created_utc":1485877809,"title":"Democratic Leadership\u2019s Anti-Trump Protest Goes Horribly Wrong","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Yosoff","created_utc":1485879929,"title":"Liberals may hate Trump\u2019s first 10 days, but GOP base loves it","num_comments":23,"description":""},{"author":"DEYoungRepublicans","created_utc":1485881114,"title":"Ryan on Trump's Immigration Order: 'What Is Happening Is Something We Support'","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"johnmountain","created_utc":1485881350,"title":"The Truth About the Useless F-35: The F-16, which is supposed to be replaced by the F-35, would \"shred\" the F-35 on any mission","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"JonathanDP81","created_utc":1485882948,"title":"The GOP Effort to Repeal and Replace Obamacare Isn\u2019t Going Very Well: New polls show the health law\u2019s popularity rising as Republicans struggle to come up with a plan.","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"formerlyrepublican","created_utc":1485890739,"title":"As of today, I am no longer a member of the Republican party.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"RaidenJeremiah","created_utc":1485892462,"title":"Gorka Debunks \u2018Muslim Ban': Most Populous Muslim Countries Left Out of Trump Executive Order","num_comments":11,"description":""},{"author":"LukeGCX","created_utc":1485895133,"title":"Owen Shroyer Destroys Trump Protesters","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"keypuncher","created_utc":1485902254,"title":"Two Republican senators say they aren\u2019t committed to voting for Betsy DeVos on Senate floor","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Manic_Psych","created_utc":1485906321,"title":"Hackers Targeted DC Police Cams Days Before Inauguration","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"IIRC","created_utc":1485909145,"title":"24 Pieces of MSM Fake News in 5 Days","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"lrcnsomenumbers","created_utc":1485910966,"title":"Questions from a liberal democrat","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"tellman1257","created_utc":1485911380,"title":"Wikipedia: Neil Gorsuch, Trump's SCOTUS pick","num_comments":69,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1485911396,"title":"Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch to Supreme Court","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"walrus-mafia","created_utc":1485911696,"title":"Neil Gorsuch: A Worthy Heir to Scalia","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"ashleyh221221","created_utc":1485912480,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Pentagon believes attack on Saudi frigate meant for US warship","num_comments":13,"description":""},{"author":"drewtam","created_utc":1485913503,"title":"american thinker: Judge Neil Gorsuch: Some Cause for Concern","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1485914671,"title":"Neil Gorsuch: A Supreme Successor to Justice Scalia","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"AnAmericanPatrician","created_utc":1485916017,"title":"President Trump Nominates Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"ashleyh221221","created_utc":1485917579,"title":"A Great Article Written By Gorsuch","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Yosoff","created_utc":1485919353,"title":"President Trump Nominates Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"MCButtersnaps","created_utc":1485920782,"title":"Sanders, Cruz to face off in debate over future of ObamaCare","num_comments":45,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1485924804,"title":"So this is what we have to deal with for the next 4 years. found by accident on \/r\/democrats","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"bigblackhotdog","created_utc":1485930396,"title":"Trump trip canceled;

Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.\n\nThey wanted to abolish income that comes from property you own, inheritance, pensions, etc. Is that a conservative view? Is that even remotely right wing? No.\n\n* 12. In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people, personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore, we demand the total confiscation of all war profits.\n\nWhile manipulating wars to gain a profit is a vile thing, merely benefiting from a war by supporting the war effort is not. Americans greatly benefitted from WWII because the huge increase in spending to fight off an huge, imminent, and catastrophic threat known as the Nazis. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Native Americans, Whites... all of them benefitted from taking jobs desperately needed in order to fight off the Nazis. And many major companies still around today, profited from the war effort fairly, and led to incredible wealth and prosperity because they were allowed to keep those profits and were not condemned as war profiteers for doing so. In turn, their companies grew, provided jobs, provided great products that benefited people, etc. Nazis did not allow that, they strictly controlled who profited and who did not, and would kill people when it was convenient for them to do so.\n\n* 13. We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries (trusts).\n\nThis one should obvious.\n\n* 14. We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries.\n\nAgain, obvious.\n\n* 15. We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.\n\nSounds like the left, doesn't it? I'd much rather give citizens the power and the freedom to choose what is best for their retirement and then provide a safety net for those who fall through the cracks in our prosperous, and free nation.\n\n* 16. We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, ***immediate communalization of the great warehouses*** and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality.\n\nWe didn't need to demand a middle class nor do we need to force the market to allow the creation of a middle class through government manipulation of market value. Market dictated a value that was mutually beneficial and led to a massive middle class boom in the 40's, 50's , and 60's. Again, this is a leftist idea that the Nazis were espousing.\n\n* 17. We demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land.\n\nSelf explanatory - this is leftist, this is socialism.\n\n* 18. We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest.\n\nThis is the result of socialism... a world where if you speak out against socialism and \"injure\" the general interest with your speech, you may be put to death.\n\n* 20. The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program....\n\nSo control at the national level of the education system without care or concern for states rights. Sounds like leftism, folks.\n\n* 21. The State is to care for the elevating national health... ...by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.\n\nSo they obligated individuals to be healthy, how do you think they did so? By severe punishment, perhaps even to the point of death? Also, just for transparency, they also wish to protect the mother\/child. Which certainly is a conservative position, except when you realize they aborted undesirables, gassed undesirables, and forced sterilizations.\n\n* 22. We demand abolition of the mercenary troops and formation of a national army.\n\nSo they were against the proliferation of guns and a healthy militia... they were against the second amendment. Who do we know today who is against the second amendment?\n\n* 23. It's long, so I'll just give you the cliff's notes, they wanted complete control of the press.\n\nWho today would like to banish stories that they label \"fake news\". That started out on the left... though admittedly, the press today is a complex issue. But the regressive left wants to shut down and control speech they deem hateful and antithetical to their views.\n\n* 24. We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state... ...It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework: The common good before the individual good.\n\nSo they were okay with freedom of religion except for the Jews, and except if the religion in anyway undermines anything remotely Aryan. The regressive left today is okay with freedom of religion, except when a religion espouses something against their view, like that maybe homosexuality isn't healthy or natural (and even when many adherents to Christianity also openly vote for gay rights). Oh, and also, you have to sacrifice for us, without necessarily benefitting in anyway because we might kill or jail you anyway, because we're nazis. So it's kind of like if I don't pay my $500+ penalty for not having insurance under Obamacare and I'm jailed because my monetary sacrifice wasn't made for the greater good. Whereas the right generally only believes in sacrifice when an imminent danger like the Nazis are knocking at our door.\n\n* 25. For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.\n\nSo massive centralized government (regressive leftism) and undying loyalty, even to a government willing to murder you. Loyalty is weirdly not part of the regressive left's plan, not to the nation anyway... though perhaps to the ideals of their platform."},{"author":"UnexpectedLizard","created_utc":1502644860,"title":"Powerful Venezuelan lawmaker may have issued death order against Rubio","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"HondaAnnaconda","created_utc":1502649917,"title":"\ud83e\udc82PROTEST HERE\ud83e\udc80","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"UnitedLaborParty","created_utc":1502650218,"title":"A conservative solution to low income housing and moving people off of benefits","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"gayconsam","created_utc":1502653562,"title":"Why despite our online presence are we not out organizing and protesting in support of our president at the pace groups like ANTIFA are protesting against him?

But when you take two minutes to look at a few numbers, it becomes apparent that it is a whole lot of smoke with very little fire.\n\n>The overall number of U.S. hate groups jumped about 17 percent in 2016 from 784 in 2014, according to [Southern Poverty Law Center] research.\n\nThese are the numbers we hear. 784 sounds like a lot of racist hate groups, doesn't it? And it especially sounds bad when the media takes that number and puts into [a story like this one](http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/state-white-supremacy-neo-nazi-groups-us\/story?id=49205764) titled \"The state of the white supremacy and neo-Nazi groups in the US\". So it sounds like those 784 groups are all white nationalist groups, and while most of them are, it is disingenuous (or some might say: a lie) to imply they are all white nationalist groups.\n\n[Here is the Southern Poverty Law Center's own map detailing where all these hate groups reside in the US](https:\/\/www.splcenter.org\/hate-map). It's an interactive map, so you can click each icon on see what group it represents. There are anti-semitic organizations presented, there are Black-separatists (blacks who hate white people), there are anti-Muslim groups, there are New Black Panthers, Nazis, Skinheads, etc.\n\nDown at the bottom of the page, you will see a number of KKK groups. There are 130 as of 2016, which sounds like a lot. Except that there are 193 Black separatist groups.\n\n[Here is the Southern Poverty Law Center's page on the KKK](https:\/\/www.splcenter.org\/fighting-hate\/extremist-files\/ideology\/ku-klux-klan). Notice the numbers:\n\n>Today, the Center estimates that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 Klan members, split among dozens of different - and often warring - organizations that use the Klan name.\n\nKeep in mind, that according the SPLC [\"black separatists\" are a subset of black nationalists](https:\/\/www.splcenter.org\/fighting-hate\/intelligence-report\/2017\/return-violent-black-nationalist), just as the KKK is a subset of white nationalists.\n\nI have not seen the numbers in terms of membership of black separatists, but lets assume for a moment that the average membership per group amongst black separatists is half that of the average size of a KKK group (about 62 members), then you get an average group size of 31 members. Multiply that by the number of groups (193) and you get just under 6,000 members nationwide. And just for argument's sake again, let's say black separatist average membership is just 1\/4 of what we see with the KKK. Then you get roughly 3,000 members nationwide.\n\nSo again, we are assuming the high estimate of KKK members at 8,000 members nationwide according the the SPLC website. And I am going with 3,000 members for the black separatists.\n\n[63% of the nation is white](http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/national\/percentage-non-hispanic-whites-hits-all-time-63-article-1.1371772) and about [13.3% of the country is black](http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/national\/percentage-non-hispanic-whites-hits-all-time-63-article-1.1371772). And yet there are more black separatist groups in the US than KKK groups. And if my membership estimates are accurate, there are still disproportionally more blacks members in these groups as compared to the percent of their total population.\n\nSo when the media is pushing a narrative that there is a sort of \"Aryan Spring\" occurring, keep in mind the numbers.\n\n* 1) The overall number of KKK members is negligible in the country, and I would argue this is true of all racist\/bigoted organizations, black, white, Asian, Middle Eastern, Jewish, Muslim, Christian, etc.\n\n* 2) A 17% increase in a negligible number is generally still a negligible number. That is not to say racist groups aren't a problem, this is just to put it into perspective.\n\n* 3) A 17% increase in a negligible number is rendered even more negligible when you realize that included in that 17% increase in hate groups is not just white nationalists, but all hate groups.\n\n* 4) Notice how when the media addresses the problem with white nationalism it more often addresses it in opposition to blacks, probably because groups like ANTIFA are the ones who most violently oppose the white nationalists. But this ignores the anti-semitism issue entirely, which, according to the [Anti-Defamation League](https:\/\/www.adl.org\/news\/press-releases\/us-anti-semitic-incidents-spike-86-percent-so-far-in-2017) has seen a spike in anti-semitic incidents that is vastly disproportional to the increase in number of hate groups in general.\n\nLet's make sure we are looking at the whole picture and not let the media set the agenda. Hate groups are all disgusting, but we must combat them with reason and with a clear mind, which includes knowing the numbers."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1503432749,"title":"NEW VID: Trump's Plan For Afghanistan.....Have We Seen This Before?

It's a Republican sub but so many of the comments I see mineaswell just been stripped from a democrat at \/r\/politics. Don't get me wrong diversity is fine but I see it so consistently eventually it makes me wonder why some people could label themselves as a republican.\n\nYou wanna be pro choice and a republican? That's fine. Pro LGBT protections? Fine. But when I see comments about universal healthcare, taxes on the \"1%\", gun control, abortion, and the minimum wage. It makes me wonder why some of y'all would even consider yourself republican. Genuinely why would at that point you be a democrat?\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's nice to not have trumpers from theD. But sometimes it just confuses me.\n\nSo why do you all consider yourself republican?\n\nI personally am very libertarian oriented which ends up making me far right economically.

It needs another 44,000 signatures by Sep 28. How can we PROMOTE this petition widely enough to reach the 100,000 minimum by the deadline? Leadership and grassroots effort are much needed","num_comments":4,"description":"As you may know, one of the most promising current White House petitions addresses the FBI's investigation into **Hillary Clinton's illegal emails**. It's not about punishing Hillary; it's about exposing a web of corruption in the Obama administration. If this petition gets 100,000 signatures by September 28, the White House guarantees a **response** within 60 days. In addition, this worthy cause will gain **credibility**, official government **recognition**, and inevitable **publicity**.\n\n##Here is the Challenge:\n\nThis Hillary petition started out strong, but interest has lagged in recent days. The petition is now **in danger of failing** to attract the required minimum of 100,000 signatures by the **September 28 deadline**. At the current rate of signing, the likely total will be about 80,000 signatures by the deadline. In other words, it will fail to achieve the required minimum. If that happens, the petition will be automatically archived and removed from public view. **It would be very sad to see this petition fail, after we've come so close to succeeding**.\n\nMoreover, if this petition fails, the White House will probably do nothing to stop the FBI cover-up. After all, Jeff Sessions has recused himself, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is an Obama holdover!  **So if ordinary Americans don't take action, the FBI will likely continue its cover-up of Hillary's apparent corruption.**\n\nHence, it is **urgent** that we promote this petition widely enough to succeed.\n\n##How you can help.\n\nHow can we attract the remaining 44,000 signatures needed before September 28? What steps can we each take? Here are some suggestions, many of which I have already taken myself:\n\n1. You can **ask your friends** to sign the petition, and to encourage their friends to do likewise.\n1. You can promote this petition on **social media**, such as Facebook and Twitter.\n1. You can encourage action on suitable online **forums**.\n1. If you belong to a **college Republican club**, you can ask the members to sign.\n1. You can write to the various **Conservative news media websites**, to ask them to mention this petition.\n1. You can ask the Republican **Political Action Committees** to alert their members.\n1. You can **email** various influential people to ask for their support.\n\nPlease **make this a top priority** until September 28. If we each do our part, and if we all work together, we can **save this very promising petition**. This is a **rare opportunity** to have our concerns recognized and publicized. We need this victory! Please help promote this petition, while there is still time.\n\n#PETITION DETAILS:\n\n##The petition title:\n\n**Compel The F.B.I. To Release All Records Pertaining To Hillary Clinton's Personal Secret Server Email Investigation**\n\n##The petition location on the White House website:\n\nhttps:\/\/petitions.whitehouse.gov\/petition\/compel-fbi-release-all-records-pertaining-hillary-clintons-personal-secret-server-email-investigation\n\n##The petition text:\n\n\"FBI records section chief David M. Hardy told investigator Ty Clevenger that he did sufficiently demonstrate that the public's interest in disclosing (Hillary's FBI records relating to her personal secret server email investigation) outweighed her personal privacy interests. This petition will show the Executive branch that there is sufficient public interest in releasing all FBI records pertaining to this case. Hillary Clinton was shielded by former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey during the email \"investigation\". Hillary has continued to echo Russian interference in the 2016 election and releasing these records should help clear the air on this matter. President Trump should compel the FBI to release to the public all records related to this investigation.\"\n\n##What the White House promises:\n\n\"The White House will ensure that petitions that cross the signature threshold make their way to the right policy folks across the government (whether they\u2019re in a White House office like the Domestic Policy Council or at a federal department or agency). The We the People team will post a response \u2013 and any updates \u2013 are posted as quickly as possible. Petition updates may come from a variety of Administration officials, including staff at the White House.\"\n\nSource: https:\/\/petitions.whitehouse.gov\/about#faqs\n\n# Examples of Recent Successful Petitions\n\nYou will be encouraged to know that these two recent White House petitions have succeeded massively:\n\n**Declare George Soros a terrorist and seize all of his related organizations' assets under RICO and NDAA law**\n\n... 143,606 signatures to date.\n\nhttps:\/\/petitions.whitehouse.gov\/petition\/declare-george-soros-terrorist-and-seize-all-his-related-organizations-assets-under-rico-and-ndaa-law\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Formally recognize AntiFa as a terrorist organization**\n\n... 348,004 signatures to date.\n\nhttps:\/\/petitions.whitehouse.gov\/petition\/formally-recognize-antifa-terrorist-organization-0\n\n------------------------------------\n\nSince both petitions reached 100,000 signatures in the first 30 days, they remain on the White House website, and people can still sign them. The more signatures, the better.\n\n**Starting now and until September 28, please do everything you can think of to promote the FBI Hillary Clinton petition.**\n\nWith your help, this petition can still succeed!\n\nThank you!"},{"author":"Pavegecko","created_utc":1505060886,"title":"Dem Rep Lujan Grisham: How We Treat DREAMers 'Is the Civil Rights Test of Our Time' - Breitbart","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1505075774,"title":"Muslim college student who lied about Trump supporter subway attack pleads guilty","num_comments":7,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"real_freedom_news","created_utc":1505092935,"title":"Governmental control","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"roosevelt4del","created_utc":1505096526,"title":"(R)Roosevelt vs. Incumbent 1st Debate for VA House of Delegates","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Pavegecko","created_utc":1505097786,"title":"Bannon: I've Fought for Racial Unity All My Life; Don\u2019t Need Lectures from \u2018Limousine Liberals\u2019 - Breitbart","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"RomanBetelgeise","created_utc":1505103429,"title":"\"Global Governance\", the Command & Control Center of Climate Alarmism","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"RomanBetelgeise","created_utc":1505105214,"title":"Poll Results: People are Waking up to the Fact that Google Searches are Politically Biased.","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1505109501,"title":"Make Hillary Clinton a certified terrorist","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1505144167,"title":"When I see another conservative comment in \/r\/politics","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Yosoff","created_utc":1505146233,"title":"George W.

Logical analysis and free debate have gone to the wayside in favor of team sport politics and an undying loyalty to your belief system.\n\n\nIn a world where the majority's opinions have been dictated by 140-character tweets and the biased sensationalist media who hide under the thin illusion of objectivity, it's fair to say that a large proportion of the Western population have been intellectually sterilized.\n\n\nWith this in mind, I'm building a platform for writers of various disciplines, experiences, and belief systems, to come together and get their opinions out into the world. My goal is to be a free speech haven of sorts, with only two caveats:\n\n\n1. To not call for violence against others or to call for the oppression\/censorship of others' speech.\n\n2. False or misleading facts\/sources are not allowed. While you could technically consider this censorship, the idea is to encourage logical debate, not to forward your own agenda while discarding the truth.\n\n\nI will not lie, this is not a paid role, at least in the short-term. I have managed two previous writing websites which started out on the basis of free writing, then as it grew and sponsorships and ad revenue grew accordingly, writers were paid on the merit of their abilities. With this in mind, I will not force anyone willing to write for us to do anything. There is no obligation to write X amount of articles or X amount of words, you can come and go as you please, and are given an enormous amount of liberty in the matters of where, what, and when, you want to write.\n\n\nIf this interests anyone, please e-mail me at **dylan@thexpol.com** with this form:\n\n\n**Name:**\n\n**Age:**\n\n**Location:**\n\n**Core beliefs\/values:**\n\n**Sample Article:**\n\n\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to message me, e-mail me, or leave a comment here and I'll respond.

Let me introduce you to ModelUSGov, a subreddit that is a political simulation based on the United States Government. I am an official representative from the model Republican Party and I am here today to speak to you about our current federal elections. If you don't know about us, we are a broad center-right to ring wing party that is relatively similar to the real life Republican Party, but with minor differences that are outlined in our [platform](http:\/\/republicans.dudaone.com\/).\n\nNow back to the elections. We are currently doing membership drives for our party and are looking to increase our representation in the government, and hopefully, achieve the status of presidency, something that only 1 other Republican has achieved in the simulation. We have had an extremist Socialist presidency for two terms, and we are looking for real change with our current presidential candidate, someone much more moderate.\n\nWe ask for your vote today. Voting only takes 30 seconds and will help us immensely. If you don't know where to vote, be advised that as per our coalition agreement we are running most of our candidates in California, Virginia, and Florida. Please [click here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ModelUSGov\/comments\/75cijn\/september_federal_election_voting_thread\/) to find the voting link and don't forget to confirm by typing \"Voted\" on the election post!

Long time fan and I really need some help. For some context I've been a Republican for as long as I can remember, which is a feat living in Southern California. I'm used to being surrounded by Liberals and Democrats. But a couple month ago I moved to Vermont. I'm in High School and they are pushing heavy liberal and democratic views and it's driving me insane. In my English class we were talking about racism and prejudice. To illustrate her point she put on a video (https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=7P0iP2Zm6a4 here's the link) in the beginning they talk about the shooting and killing of Amadou Diallo.

We post news, policy briefs, and discussion from that perspective, and are seeking to revive mainstream moderate conservatism both online and in Washington. The name comes from the Tuesday Group: an informal caucus (some would say Power Cabal) for centrist House Republicans currently led by Congressman Charlie Dent. \n\n(And yes. They meet on Tuesday. Their previous iteration was called \"the Wednesday Group\" because they met on Wednesday. They tend to compensate for their strength in policy with a weakness in the snazzy names department). \n\nIf you're a right-leaning moderate or centrist, r\/Tuesday is the place for you! We're an active subreddit, with a bi-weekly discussion thread and continual updates from policy and news sources as fast as our users can find them.

These transformations have profound implications for \n> American business leaders and owners, our culture and our way of life.\n> \n>    1. The War in Iraq\n> \n>    There are three major monotheistic religions in the world: Christianity, \n> Judaism and Islam. In the 16th century, Judaism and Christianity reconciled with \n> the modern world. The rabbis, priests and\n>    scholars found a way to settle up and pave the way forward. Religion \n> remained at the center of life, church and state became separate. Rule of law, \n> idea of economic liberty, individual rights, human Rights-all these are defining \n> point of modern Western civilization. These concepts started with the Greeks but \n> didn't take off until the 15th and 16th century when Judaism and Christianity \n> found a way to reconcile with the modern world.  When that happened, it \n> unleashed the scientific revolution and the greatest outpouring of art, \n> literature and music the world has ever known.\n> \n> \n> \n>     Islam, which developed in the 7th century, counts millions of Moslems \n> around the world who are normal people. However, there is a radical streak \n> within Islam. When the radicals are in charge, Islam attacks Western \n> civilization.  Islam first attacked Western civilization in the 7th century, and \n> later in the 16th and 17th centuries. By 1683, the Moslems (Turks from the \n> Ottoman Empire) were literally at the gates of Vienna. It was in Vienna that the \n> climatic battle between Islam and Western civilization took place. The West won \n> and went forward. Islam lost and went backward. Interestingly, the date of that \n> battle was September 11. Since then, Islam has not found a way to reconcile with \n> the modern world.\n> \n>    Today, terrorism is the third attack on Western civilization by radical \n> Islam. To deal with terrorism, the U.S. is doing two things. First, units of our \n> armed forces are in 30 countries around the world hunting down terrorist groups \n> and dealing with them. This gets very little publicity. Second we are taking \n> military action in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n> \n>    These actions are covered relentlessly by the media. People can argue about \n> whether the war in Iraq is right or wrong. However, the underlying strategy \n> behind the war is to use our military to remove the radicals from power and give \n> the moderates a chance. Our hope is that, over time, the moderates will find a \n> way to bring Islam forward into the 21st century. That's what our involvement in \n> Iraq and Afghanistan is all about.\n> \n>    The lesson of 9\/11 is that we live in a world where a small number of people \n> can kill a large number of people very quickly. They can use  airplanes, bombs, \n> anthrax, chemical weapons or dirty bombs. Even with a first-rate intelligence \n> service (which the U.S. does not have), you can't stop every attack. That means \n> our tolerance for political horseplay has dropped to zero. No longer will we \n> play games with terrorists or weapons of mass destructions.\n> \n>    Most of the instability and horseplay is coming from the Middle East. That's \n> why we have thought that if we could knock out the radicals and give the \n> moderates a chance to hold power, they might find a way to reconcile Islam with \n> the modern world. So when looking at Afghanistan or Iraq, it's important to look \n> for any signs that they are modernizing.\n> \n>    For example, women being brought into the work force and colleges in \n> Afghanistan is good. The Iraqis stumbling toward a constitution is good.\n> \n>    People can argue about what the U.S. is doing and how we're doing it, but \n> anything that suggests Islam is finding its way forward is good.\n> \n>    2. The Emergence of China\n> \n>    In the last 20 years, China has moved 250 million people from the farms and \n> villages into the cities. Their plan is to move another 300  million in the next \n> 20 years. When you put that many people into the cities, you have to find work \n> for them.  That's why China is addicted to manufacturing; they have to put all \n> the relocated people to work. When we decide to manufacture something in the \n> U.S., it's based on market needs and the opportunity to make a profit. In China, \n> they make the decision because they want the jobs, which is a very different \n> calculation.\n> \n> \n> \n>    While China is addicted to manufacturing, Americans are addicted to low \n> prices. As a result, a unique kind of economic codependency has developed \n> between the two countries. If we ever stop buying from China, they will explode \n> politically. If China stops selling to us, our economy will take a huge hit \n> because prices will jump. We are subsidizing their economic development; they \n> are subsidizing our economic growth. Because of their huge growth in \n> manufacturing, China is hungry for raw materials, which drives prices up \n> worldwide. China is also thirsty for oil, which is one reason oil is now at $100 \n> a barrel. By 2020, China will produce more cars than the U.S.  China is also \n> buying its way into the oil infrastructure around the world. They are doing it \n> in the open market and paying fair market prices, but millions of barrels of oil \n> that would have gone to the U.S. are now going to China.  China's quest to \n> assure it has the oil it needs to fuel its economy is a major factor in world \n> politics and economics.\n> \n>    We have our Navy fleets protecting the sea lines, specifically the ability \n> to get the tankers through.  It won't be long before the Chinese have an \n> aircraft carrier sitting in the Persian Gulf as well. The question is, will \n> their aircraft carrier be pointing in the same direction as ours or against us?\n> \n> \n> \n>    3. Shifting Demographics of Western Civilization\n> \n>    Most countries in the Western world have stopped breeding. For a \n> civilization obsessed with sex, this is remarkable.  Maintaining a steady \n> population requires a birth rate of 2.1  In Western Europe, the birth rate \n> currently stands at 1.5, or 30 percent below replacement. In 30 years there will \n> be 70 to 80 million fewer Europeans than there are today.  The current birth \n> rate in Germany is 1.3. Italy and Spain are even lower at 1.2. At that rate, the \n> working age population declines by 30 percent in 20 years, which has a huge \n> impact on the economy.  When you don't have young workers to replace the older \n> ones, you have to import them.\n> \n> \n>    The European countries are currently importing Moslems. Today, the Moslems \n> comprise 10 percent of France and Germany, and the percentage is rising rapidly \n> because they have higher birthrates . However, the Moslem populations are not \n> being integrated into the cultures of their host countries, which is a political \n> catastrophe. One reason Germany and France don't support the Iraq war is they \n> fear their Moslem populations will explode on them. By 2020, more than half of \n> all births in the Netherlands will be non-European.\n> \n> \n>    The huge design flaw in the postmodern secular state is that you need a \n> traditional religious society birth rate to sustain it. The Europeans simply \n> don't wish to have children, so they are dying.  In Japan, the birthrate is 1.3. \n> As a result, Japan will lose up to 60 million people over the next 30 years. \n> Because Japan has a very different society than Europe, they refuse to import \n> workers. Instead, they are just shutting down. Japan has already closed 2,000 \n> schools, and is closing them down at the rate of 300 per year.  Japan is also \n> aging very rapidly. By 2020, one out of every five Japanese will be at least 70 \n> years old. Nobody has any idea about how to run an economy with those \n> demographics.\n> \n>    Europe and Japan, which comprise two of the world's major economic engines \n> aren't merely in recession they're shutting down. This will have a huge impact \n> on the world economy, and it is already beginning to happen. Why are the \n> birthrates so low? There is a direct correlation between abandonment of \n> traditional religious society and a drop in birth rate, and Christianity in \n> Europe is becoming irrelevant.\n> \n>    The second reason is economic. When the birth rate drops below\n>    replacement, the population ages. With fewer working people to support more \n> retired people, it puts a crushing tax burden on the smaller group of working \n> age people. As a result, young people delay marriage and having a family. Once \n> this trend starts, the downward spiral only gets worse.  These countries have \n> abandoned all the traditions they formerly held in regard to having families and \n> raising children.\n> \n>    The U.S. birth rate is 2.0, just below replacement. We have an increase in \n> population because of immigration. When broken down by ethnicity, the Anglo \n> birth rate is 1.6 (same as France) while the Hispanic birth rate is 2.7. In the \n> U.S., the baby boomers are starting to retire in massive numbers. This will push \n> the elder dependency ratio from 19 to 38 over the next 10 to 15 years. This is \n> not as bad as Europe, but still represents the same kind of trend.\n> \n>    Western civilization seems to have forgotten what every primitive society \n> understands -- you need kids to have a healthy society. Children are huge \n> consumers. Then they grow up to become taxpayers. That's how a society works, \n> but the postmodern secular state seems to have forgotten that. If U.S. birth \n> rates of the past 20 to 30 years had been the same as post-World War II, there \n> would be no Social Security or Medicare problems.\n> \n>    The world's most effective birth control device is money. As society creates \n> a middle class and women move into the workforce, birth rates drop. Having large \n> families is incompatible with middle class living.  The quickest way to drop the \n> birth rate is through rapid economic development.  After World War II, the U.S. \n> instituted a $600 tax credit per child. The idea was to enable mom and dad to \n> have four children without being troubled by taxes. This led to a baby boom of \n> 22 million kids, which was a huge consumer market. That turned into a huge tax \n> base. However, to match that incentive in today's dollars would cost $12,000 per \n> child.\n> \n>    China and India do not have declining populations. However, in both \n> countries, there is a preference for boys over girls, and we now have the \n> technology to know which is which before they are born. In China and India, \n> families are aborting the girls. As a result, in each of these countries there \n> are 70 million boys growing up who will never find wives. When left alone, \n> nature produces 103 boys for every 100 girls. In some provinces, however, the \n> ratio is 128 boys to every 100 girls.\n> \n>    The birth rate in Russia is so low that by 2050 their population will be \n> smaller than that of Yemen. Russia has one-sixth of the earth's land surface and \n> much of its oil. You can't control that much area with such a small population.  \n> Immediately to the south, you have China with 70 million unmarried men who are a \n> real potential nightmare scenario for Russia.\n> \n>    4. Restructuring of American Business\n> \n>    The fourth major transformation involves a fundamental restructuring of \n> American business. Today's business environment is very complex and competitive. \n> To succeed, you have to be the best, which means having the highest quality and \n> lowest cost. Whatever your price point, you must have the best quality and \n> lowest price. To be the best, you have to concentrate on one thing. You can't be \n> all things to all people and be the best.\n> \n>    A generation ago, IBM used to make every part of their computer. Now Intel \n> makes the chips, Microsoft makes the software, and someone else makes the \n> modems, hard drives, monitors, etc. IBM even outsources their call center.  \n> Because IBM has all these companies supplying goods and services cheaper and \n> better than they could do it themselves, they can make a better computer at a \n> lower cost. This is called a fracturing of business. When one company can make a \n> better product by relying on others to perform functions the business used to do \n> itself, it creates a complex pyramid of companies that serve and support each \n> other.\n> \n>    This fracturing of American business is now in its second generation. The \n> companies who supply IBM are now doing the same thing - outsourcing many of \n> their core services and production process. As a result, they can make cheaper, \n> better products. Over time, this pyramid continues to get bigger and bigger. \n> Just when you think it can't fracture again, it does.\n> \n>    Even very small businesses can have a large pyramid of corporate entities \n> that perform many of its important functions. One aspect of this trend is that \n> companies end up with fewer employees and more independent contractors.  This \n> trend has also created two new words in business, integrator and complementor. \n> At the top of the pyramid, IBM is the integrator. As you go down the pyramid, \n> Microsoft, Intel and the other companies that support IBM are the complementors. \n> However, each of the complementors is itself an integrator for the complementors \n> underneath it.\n> \n>    This has several implications, the first of which is that we are now getting \n> false readings on the economy. People who used to be employees are now \n> independent contractors launching their own businesses.. There are many people \n> working whose work is not listed as a job. As a result, the economy is perking \n> along better than the numbers are telling us. \n> \n> \n>    Outsourcing also confused the numbers. Suppose a company like General Motors \n> decides to outsource all its employee cafeteria functions to Marriott (which it \n> did). It lays off hundreds of cafeteria workers, who then get hired right back \n> by Marriott.  The only thing that has changed is that these people work for \n> Marriott rather than GM. Yet, the media headlines will scream that America has \n> lost more manufacturing jobs.\n> \n> \n> \n>    All that really happened is that these workers are now reclassified as \n> service workers. So the old way of counting jobs contributes to false economic \n> readings. As yet, we haven't figured out how to make the numbers catch up with \n> the changing realities of the business world.\n> \n>    Another implication of this massive restructuring is that because companies \n> are getting rid of units and people that used to work for them, the entity is \n> smaller. As the companies get smaller and more efficient, revenues are going \n> down but profits are going up. As a result, the old notion that revenues are up \n> and we're doing great isn't always the case anymore. Companies are getting \n> smaller but are becoming more efficient and profitable in the process.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>    IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOUR TRANSFORMATIONS\n> \n>    1. The War in Iraq\n> \n>    In some ways, the war is going very well. Afghanistan and Iraq have the \n> beginnings of a modern government, which is a huge step forward. The Saudis are \n> starting to talk about some good things, while Egypt and Lebanon are beginning \n> to move in a good direction. A series of revolutions have taken place in \n> countries like Ukraine and Georgia.\n> \n>    There will be more of these revolutions for an interesting reason. In every \n> revolution, there comes a point where the dictator turns to the general and \n> says, Fire into the crowd.  If the general fires into the crowd, it stops the \n> revolution. If the general says No, the revolution continues.  Increasingly, the \n> generals are saying No because their kids are in the crowd.\n> \n>    Thanks to TV and the Internet, the average 18-year old outside the U.S. is \n> very savvy about what is going on in the world, especially in terms of popular \n> culture. There is a huge global consciousness, and young people around the world \n> want to be a part of it. It is increasingly apparent to them that the miserable \n> government where they live is the only thing standing in their way. More and \n> more, it is the well-educated kids, the children of the generals and the elite, \n> who are leading the revolutions.\n> \n>    At the same time, not all is well with the war. The level of violence in \n> Iraq is much worse and doesn't appear to be improving. It's possible that we're \n> asking too much of Islam all at one time. We're trying to jolt them from the 7th \n> century to the 21st century all at once, which may be further than they can go. \n> They might make it and they might not. Nobody knows for sure. The point is, we \n> don't know how the war will turn out. Anyone who says they know is just \n> guessing.\n> \n>    The real place to watch is Iran. If they actually obtain nuclear weapons it \n> will be a terrible situation. There are two ways to deal with it.. The first is \n> a military strike, which will be very difficult. The Iranians have dispersed \n> their nuclear development facilities and put them underground. The U.S. has \n> nuclear weapons that can go under the earth and take out those facilities, but \n> we don't want to do that.\n> \n> \n>    The other way is to separate the radical mullahs from the government, which \n> is the most likely course of action.  Seventy percent of the Iranian population \n> is under 30. They are Moslem but not Arab. They are mostly pro-Western. Many \n> experts think the U.S. should have dealt with Iran before going to war with \n> Iraq. The problem isn't so much the weapons; it's the people who control them. \n> If Iran has a moderate government, the weapons become less of a concern.\n> \n>    We don't know if we will win the war in Iraq. We could lose or win. What \n> we're looking for is any indicator that Islam is moving into the 21st century \n> and stabilizing,\n> \n> \n> \n>    2. China\n> \n>    It may be that pushing 500 million people from farms and villages into \n> cities is too much too soon. Although it gets almost no publicity, China is \n> experiencing hundreds of demonstrations around the country, which is \n> unprecedented.  These are not students in Tiananmen Square. These are average \n> citizens who are angry with the government for building chemical plants and \n> polluting the water they drink and the air they breathe.\n> \n>    The Chinese are a smart and industrious people. They may be able to pull it \n> off and become a very successful economic and military superpower.  If so, we \n> will have to learn to live with it. If they want to share the responsibility of \n> keeping the world's oil lanes open, that's a good thing. They currently have \n> eight new nuclear electric power generators under way and 45 on the books to \n> build. Soon, they will leave the U.S. way behind in their ability to generate \n> nuclear power.\n> \n>    What can go wrong with China? For one, you can't move 550 million people \n> into the cities without major problems. Two China really wants Taiwan, not so \n> much for economic reasons, they just want it. The Chinese know that their system \n> of communism can't survive much longer in the 21st century. The last thing they \n> want to do before they morph into some sort of more capitalistic government is \n> to take over Taiwan.  We may wake up one morning and find they have launched an \n> attack on Taiwan.  If so, it will be a mess, both economically and militarily. \n> The U.S. has committed to the military defense of Taiwan. If China attacks \n> Taiwan, will we really go to war against them? If the Chinese generals believe \n> the answer is no, they may attack. If we don't defend Taiwan, every treaty the \n> U.S. has will be worthless. Hopefully, China won't do anything stupid.\n> \n>    3. Demographics\n> \n>    Europe and Japan are dying because their populations are aging and \n> shrinking. These trends can be reversed if the young people start breeding.  \n> However, the birth rates in these areas are so low it will take two generations \n> to turn things around.  No economic model exists that permits 50 years to turn \n> things around. Some countries are beginning to offer incentives for people to \n> have bigger families. For example, Italy is offering tax breaks for having \n> children. However, it's a lifestyle issue versus a tiny amount of money. \n> Europeans aren't willing to give up their comfortable lifestyles in order to \n> have more children.\n> \n>    In general, everyone in Europe just wants it to last a while longer. \n> Europeans have a real talent for living. They don't want to work very hard. The \n> average European worker gets 400 more hours of vacation time per year than \n> Americans. They don't want to work and they don't want to make any of the \n> changes needed to revive their economies. The summer after 9\/11, France lost \n> 15,000 people in a heat wave. In August, the country basically shuts down when \n> everyone goes on vacation.\n> \n> \n>    That year, a severe heat wave struck and 15,000 elderly people living in \n> nursing homes and hospitals died. Their children didn't even leave the beaches \n> to come back and take care of the bodies. Institutions had to scramble to find \n> enough refrigeration units to hold the bodies until people came to claim them.  \n> This loss of life was five times bigger than 9\/11 in America, yet it didn't \n> trigger any change in French society.\n> \n>    When birth rates are so low, it creates a tremendous tax burden on the \n> young. Under those circumstances, keeping mom and dad alive is not an attractive \n> option. That's why euthanasia is becoming so popular in most European countries. \n> The only country that doesn't permit (and even encourage) euthanasia is Germany, \n> because of all the baggage from World War II.\n> \n>    The European economy is beginning to fracture. Countries like Italy are \n> starting to talk about pulling out of the European Union because it is killing \n> them. When things get bad economically in Europe, they tend to get very nasty \n> politically. The canary in the mine is anti-Semitism.  When it goes up, it means \n> trouble is coming. Current levels of anti-Semitism are higher than ever.\n> \n>    Germany won't launch another war, but Europe will likely get shabbier, more \n> dangerous and less pleasant to live in.  Japan has a birth rate of 1.3 and has \n> no intention of bringing in immigrants. By 2020, one out of every five Japanese \n> will be 70 years old. Property values in Japan have dropped every year for the \n> past 14 years. The country is simply shutting down.  In the U..S. we also have \n> an aging population. Boomers are starting to retire at a massive rate. These \n> retirements will have several major impacts:\n> \n>    Possible massive sell-off of large, four-bedroom houses and a movement to \n> condos an enormous drain on the treasury. Boomers vote, and they want their \n> benefits, even if it means putting a crushing tax burden on their kids to get \n> them. Social Security will be a huge problem. As this generation ages, it will \n> start to drain the system. We are the only country in the world where there are \n> no age limits on medical procedures. \n> \n>    An enormous drain on the health care system, this will also increase the tax \n> burden on the young, which will cause them to delay marriage and having \n> families, which will drive down the birth rate even further.\n> \n>    Although scary, these demographics also present enormous opportunities for \n> products and services tailored to aging populations. There will be a tremendous \n> demand for caring for older people, especially those who don't need nursing \n> homes but need some level of care. Some people will have a business where they \n> take care of three or four people in their homes.  The demand for that type of \n> service and for products to physically care for aging people will be huge.\n> \n>    Make sure the demographics of your business are attuned to where the action \n> is. For example, you don't want to be a baby food company in Europe or Japan. \n> Demographics are much underrated as an indicator of where the opportunities are.  \n> Businesses need customers. Go where the customers are.\n> \n>    4. Restructuring of American Business\n> \n> \n>    The restructuring of American business means we are coming to the end of the \n> age of the employer and employee. With all this fracturing of businesses into \n> different and smaller units, employers can't guarantee jobs anymore because they \n> don't know what their companies will look like next year. Everyone is on their \n> way to becoming an independent contractor.\n> \n>    The new workforce contract will be: Show up at the my office five days a \n> week and do what I want you to do, but you handle your own insurance, benefits, \n> health care and everything else.  Husbands and wives are becoming economic \n> units. They take different jobs and work different shifts depending on where \n> they are in their careers and families. They make tradeoffs to put together a \n> compensation package to take care of the family.\n> \n>    This used to happen only with highly educated professionals with high \n> incomes. Now it is happening at the level of the factory floor worker. Couples \n> at all levels are designing their compensation packages based on their \n> individual needs. The only way this can work is if everything is portable and \n> flexible, which requires a huge shift in the American economy.\n> \n>    The U.S. is in the process of building the world's first 21st century model \n> economy. The only other countries doing this are U.K. and Australia. The model \n> is fast, flexible, highly productive and unstable in that it is always \n> fracturing and re-fracturing. This will increase \n>    the economic gap between the U.S. and everybody else, especially Europe and \n> Japan.\n> \n>     At the same time, the military gap is increasing. Other than China, we are \n> the only country that is continuing to put money into their military. Plus, we \n> are the only military getting on-the-ground military experience through our war \n> in Iraq. We know which high-tech weapons are working and which ones aren't. \n> There is almost no one who can take us on economically or militarily.\n> \n>    There has never been a superpower in this position before.  On the one hand, \n> this makes the U.S.. a magnet for bright and ambitious people. It also makes us \n> a target. We are becoming one of the last holdouts of the traditional \n> Judeo-Christian culture. There is no better place in the world to be in business \n> and raise children. The U.S. is by far the best place to have an idea, form a \n> business and put it into the marketplace. We take it for granted, but it isn't \n> as available in other countries of the world.  Ultimately, it's an issue of \n> culture.. The only people who can hurt us are ourselves, by losing our culture. \n> If we give up our Judeo-Christian culture, we become just like the Europeans. \n> The culture war is the whole ball game. If we lose it, there isn't another \n> America to pull us out.\n"},{"author":"macaronipancake","created_utc":1509135022,"title":"Largest VA based Newspaper Endorses Republican Ed Gillespie for Governor","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"em_kaib","created_utc":1509137481,"title":"A New Way Forward For Republicans","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"em_kaib","created_utc":1509138083,"title":"Trump, The Independent","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CrimsonStudioz","created_utc":1509139903,"title":"Has \"Political Correctness\" gone too Far?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"talkativetorbjorn","created_utc":1509140464,"title":"Democrats vs republican","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Nrl4f2","created_utc":1509142095,"title":"Sen.

ModelUSGov is a political simulation inside a subreddit, based on the United States Government. I am a representative from the model Republican Party and I am here today to speak to you about our current election. If you don't know about us, we are a broad center-right to right wing party that is relatively similar to the real life Republican Party, but we are more broad in the beliefs will hold. For example, we have many different caucus\u2019s in the party such as the Patriot Caucus (Our Tea Party), Moderate Caucus (for moderates... duh), and he Liberty Caucus (for Libertarians.)\n\nNow back to the elections. We are currently doing membership drives for our party and are looking to increase our representation in the government. We ask for your help in 2 special state elections, which will determine the governorship of two states.\n\n**We need help making sure the Socialist party doesn't win this one!** Voting only takes 15 seconds and will help us immensely. If you don't know where to vote, be advised that this election is only for Southern State (real life Florida, Alabama, Georgia, etc..) and Central (Michigan, Wisconsin, etc..), but the Republican candidate is only running in Southern. Please [click here](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/ModelUSGov\/comments\/7a3gz0\/october_state_elections_thread\/) to find the voting link and feel free to confirm by typing \"Voted\" on the election post (although not necessary).

I was debating that they should, because I am a republican and I believe that they should respect the flag. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere were my points of debate, using evidence such as Prager University videos and several news reports (I was forced to use sources that I considered \"fake news\", but I used them to my advantage.)\n\n* The protest's meaning or cause is misleading and is based off of false facts, and exaggerated statistics. The media is simply just making the title of \"unarmed black man\" too many times without any context\n* Even if the protest's meaning was true, not all police officers are racist, only a small amount of them are. It is unfair and irresponsible to protest a flag representing every American, whether your White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian over a small amount of them.\n* The 1st Amendment only applies to when your working with the government, not when your working with private companies and corporations, such as the NFL, or other major sporting leagues. I fully support anybody who fires or takes someone off the field for disrespecting the flag of the country they are playing in.\n* In my state (Florida), there is a state law requiring students to stand and place their hand on their heart for the flag unless they have a written note from their parents. Why not apply the same logic to football players across the country, including our community and city? [*Please refer to FL Statute 1003.44.*](http:\/\/www.leg.state.fl.us\/statutes\/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=1000-1099\/1003\/Sections\/1003.44.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Even after all of the argument I presented respectfully, and with evidence to back it up...** the other side continued to argue against the same things I already addressed with their argument. Additionally they claimed that \"almost all white people are racist to minority people\" or \"all unarmed black police shootings you see on the news is real and on purpose\". This pissed me off because the majority of the class are liberals. The grade for each debator was based on the majority of the class who sided with each side, in which almost all the class sided with the other side. I worked hard on my argument and it makes me mad when someone walks in with little to no evidence or real basis for an argument and take it all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why do almost all of my peers seem to automatically be against conservative material or arguments?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n"},{"author":"Vazoof","created_utc":1513473119,"title":"Congresswoman Says Rumor Is That Trump Will Fire Mueller Before Christmas","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"10gauge","created_utc":1513473389,"title":"Congressman (D) will not seek relection amid misconduct probe","num_comments":12,"description":""},{"author":"urban__sombrero","created_utc":1513496314,"title":"Allowing biased Bob Mueller to continue is becoming more and more indefensible.

An Associated Press headline reads, \"House Passes First Rewrite of Nation's Tax Laws in Three Decades, Providing Steep Tax Cuts for Businesses, the Wealthy.\" And so on.\n\n>There will always be ideological arguments regarding the efficacy of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, but at some point people are going to find out that they've gotten one, too. The nonpartisan liberals at the Tax Policy Center concede that 80 percent of Americans will see a tax cut in 2018, and that the average cut will be $2,140\u2014which might be something to scoff at in D.C., but I imagine a bunch of voters surprised by these savings will be less cynical.
