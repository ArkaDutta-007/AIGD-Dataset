When the demand for food, housing, gas, is rising faster than production (i.e. demand is exceeding supply) then the price of food, rent\/homes, and gas will rise.  That's basic economics.  But I only ever hear republicans talking about how the cause of inflation is printing too much money causing there to be too many dollars chasing too few goods.  I've heard a sum total of zero republicans talk about how the border crisis is a major factor for inflation.  This is a major misfire by republican leadership to inform the average American as to how the border surge is costing them money.

The party was an odd amalgam of pro-slavery Southern Whigs, Whigs with other interests at the top of their to-do lists, and nothern, anti-slavery Whigs. In 1852 Whig candidate Winfield Scott was thoroughly trounced and there looked to be no hope to keep the party together as other groups like the Free Soilers were on the rise.\n\nThe issue of slavery in the western states was a tinderbox at the time and the issue of Slavery in Nebraska sparked a group of people in Ripon, Wisconsin to take action. Their first meeting was announced on March 1, 1854 by an active anti-slavery Whig, Alvan E. Bovay, in the local newspaper.\n\nHe published a new proclamation after that meeting saying a new \"Great Northern Party\" was being created, \"composed of Whigs, Democrats, and Freesoilers.\" Another ad was soon taken out for the meeting which would officially give that party a name.\n\nOn March 20, 1854 in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin that new party was called the \"Republican Party.\" Bovay and sixteen other people made plans for a convention to announce candidates for state and federal offices. A committee was formed by five men - Bovay, Jedhiah Bowen, Amos Loper, Abram Thomas, and Jacob Woodruff. They were previously three Whigs, a Democrat, and a Free Soiler, but when they left the schoolhouse that day, they were Republicans.\n\n----\n\n**Documents:** Ads for meetings of a new \"Great Northern Party\"\n\n**Writer:** Alvan E. Bovay, Anti-Slavery Whig\n\n**Publisher:** local Ripon Newspaper\n\nSources: James McPherson's, *Battle Cry of Freedom* cited by and retrieved from [Constituting America](https:\/\/constitutingamerica.org\/march-20-1854-the-republican-party-is-founded-guest-essayist-scot-faulkner\/)\n\n-----\n\nAd 1 - March 1, 1854\n\n\"NEBRASKA. A meeting will be held at 6:30 o\u2019clock this Wednesday evening at the Congregational church in the village of Ripon to remonstrate against the Nebraska swindle.\"\n\n-----\n\nAd 2 - Made after the first meeting\n\n\"THE NEBRASKA BILL. A bill expressly intended to extend slavery will be the call to arms of a Great Northern Party, such as the country has not hitherto seen, composed of Whigs, Democrats, and Freesoilers; every man with a heart in him united under the single banner dry of 'Repeal!' 'Repeal!'\"\n\n-------\n\nAd 3 - Made in Preparation for next meeting\n\n\"The Nebraska bill. A bill expressly intended to extend and strengthen the institution of slavery has passed the Senate by a very large majority, many northern Senators voting for it and many more sitting in their seats and not voting at all. It is evidently destined to pass the House and become law, unless its progress is arrested by a general uprising of the north against it.\n\nTherefore, We, the undersigned, believing the community to be nearly quite unanimous in opposition to the nefarious scheme, would call upon the public meeting of citizens of all parties to be held at the school house in Ripon on Monday evening, March 20, at 6:30 o\u2019clock, to resolve, to petition, and to organize against it.\""},{"author":"RoadLessTraveledWI","created_utc":1710942753,"title":"Today is the 170th anniversary of the Republican Party!","num_comments":1,"description":"The Republican Party had their first meeting in Ripon Wisconsin on March 20, 1854.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal just posted and article about it.\n\n[https:\/\/www.jsonline.com\/story\/life\/green-sheet\/2024\/03\/18\/what-to-know-about-the-birthplace-of-the-republican-party-in-wisconsin\/72683163007\/](https:\/\/www.jsonline.com\/story\/life\/green-sheet\/2024\/03\/18\/what-to-know-about-the-birthplace-of-the-republican-party-in-wisconsin\/72683163007\/)\n\nAnd we created a 20 minute YouTube video on the subject.\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/H2SDtJPQ09A](https:\/\/youtu.be\/H2SDtJPQ09A)\n\n&#x200B;"},{"author":"RoadLessTraveledWI","created_utc":1710943552,"title":"Today is the 170th anniversary of the Republican Party!","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"RoadLessTraveledWI","created_utc":1710944059,"title":"Today is the 170th anniversary of the Republican Party!","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"RoadLessTraveledWI","created_utc":1710944525,"title":"Today is the 170th anniversary of the Republican Party!","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"chicagomovieproducer","created_utc":1710944715,"title":"March 19th 2024 Elections Politics Democrat Political Industrial Complex Clown \ud83e\udd21 \ud83d\udc38 World \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0e","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Dreamnobe7","created_utc":1710946571,"title":"Russians pretending to be Americans","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"RedBaronsBrother","created_utc":1710950323,"title":"Iraqi Migrant Plotted to Smuggle Assassins over Mexico Border to Kill Former President George W Bush","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"RedBaronsBrother","created_utc":1710951425,"title":"Tony Bobulinski Blasts Jamie Raskin and Dan Goldman as \"Liars\"","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"UpstateNyPolitics","created_utc":1710951537,"title":"New York Republican Senate Primary Twitter Poll","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1710951970,"title":"Former Trump Aide Peter Navarro Decries \u2018Partisan Weaponization\u2019 Of Justice As He Begins Prison Sentence","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1710952005,"title":"Jim Jordan Demands Answers From DHS On How Haitian Migrant Charged With Raping Minor Entered U.S.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1710952051,"title":"RNC Sues Nevada Secretary Of State Alleging \u2018Impossibly High\u2019 Voter Rolls","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"RedBaronsBrother","created_utc":1710953318,"title":"'15 Days to Slow the Spread'","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"salaciousserver","created_utc":1710954307,"title":"Hunter Biden Ex-Business Partners To Go Scorched Earth On Bidens, House Democrats In Testimony","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"SuccessfulRelative66","created_utc":1710954588,"title":"Why do people say that Republicans have moved far right?","num_comments":109,"description":"I have seen posts on other subreddits from people claiming that Republicans have moved far right.

When Robert Mugabe drove out all the whites and parsed out their land this created a massive famine because they drove out all the people who knew how to farm. The same thing is playing out in South Africa right now.\n\nIn Venezuela they nationalized the oil companies, so all the oil workers left, which caused the Venezuelan economy (which is completely dependent on oil) to collapse.\n\nCapital flight is a big reason why socialism and communism inevitably target the middle class and the working class. As they lose wealthy people to target and confiscate wealth they are forced to go further and further down the tax brackets in order to fund their revolution. They justify this by labeling those groups as petit bourgeois, and claim that they would simply take the place of the wealthy that were driven out. So the end result is everyone is driven into poverty except for the few privileged members of the party."},{"author":"2KALUBAFAK40z","created_utc":1711388351,"title":"Karl Marx said, \"Remove one

Proof that the dem party has become the party of criminals and lawlessness and that they really don't care about ANY Americans (which includes people of all races, colors, religions, genders, classes, sexual orientations and heritages\u2013including LEGAL immigrants), even their own constituents. In states and cities in which police were already defunded or even reduced, violent crimes and murders have increased significantly \u2013 and in a very short time immediately after the defunding. Every drop of blood spilt is on their hands. Proof once again that the dems do not care about anyone \u2013 even their own constituents \u2013 as they are willing to put us all in grave danger \u2013 or worse \u2013 just to forward their warped agenda. \n\nThe dems are literally threatening and supporting the removal of our very security by completely defunding and dismantling the police across the country (while they have bolstered their own personal security at the taxpayers\u2019 expense). \n\nGUN CONTROL DOES NOT WORK. The majority of guns used by criminals are bought on the black market - criminals do not obey laws. The last several terror attacks in Europe & the UK involved someone driving a van or another vehicle into a crowd, killing many people. The point is evil will find a way and if someone wants to kill someone they will find a way. Guns are illegal in France and yet 150 people died in a terrorist shooting in Paris. Chicago has the strongest gun control laws in the land and yet they have the highest number of shootings - over 5,000 last year alone (BTW WHERE IS THE LIBERAL AND MEDIA FAUX OUTRAGE THERE?? - and no the guns didn't come from out of state or another city, as the surrounding cities and states don't have nearly the same level of shootings as Chicago, in fact they have almost none), with NYC having the second highest number of shootings and NY has gun control laws almost as stringent as Chicago; California has more shootings than any state, and their laws are just as stringent as those of Chicago as well. Similarly, London, in which guns have been banned, just exceeded NYC's murder rate as they have seen an escalation of killings - SINCE THE BANNING OF GUNS, largely by knives. Australia \u2013 in which guns are illegal - recently had a school shooting in which 10 people were killed, 4 of which were children. In Japan \u2013 in which ALL GUNS ARE ILLEGAL \u2013 the Prime Minister was recently shot to death in broad daylight in public! Conversely, Switzerland has an incredibly high rate of gun ownership and practically zero mass shootings. The trans Nashville shooter purposely targetd a \u201cgun-free zone\u201d! Gun control doesn't work.\n\nThe solution is to INCREASE POLICE \u2013 not defund them - and allow them to do their job, while also putting bail back in place. It is no coincidence that the cities with the worst crime rates are all democrat run, have defunded and reduced the police, and removed bail, such that the few times the police are actually able to do their job the few criminals they actually capture are allowed back on the street the same day. In NYC, 85% of the crimes committed are by those who were arrested in the previous two weeks, but were let back on the street as a result of the fact that there is no bail. And btw, all these massive increases in crime occurred while each of these cities with the highest crime rates implemented the most stringent gun control laws in the country \u2013 in fact over the past few years (prior the point that crime has increased so precipitously), these cities\u2019 respective gun laws have actually become more stringent. Proof once again, that gun control does not work. \n\n[https:\/\/nypost.com\/2023\/08\/19\/nyc-stabbings-and-slashings-surge-in-2023-by-26\/](https:\/\/nypost.com\/2023\/08\/19\/nyc-stabbings-and-slashings-surge-in-2023-by-26\/)"},{"author":"Extension_Sundae2435","created_utc":1712674227,"title":"Who Would REALLY Win A Civil War?","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Bog2ElectricBoogaloo","created_utc":1712676569,"title":"Woohoo!","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Lobster1958","created_utc":1712677437,"title":"TikTok content creator talks about his funny \"America vs Israel\" videos","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"baskaat","created_utc":1712686485,"title":"Podcasts about Trump\u2019s trials?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Fit_Soup_2275","created_utc":1712687608,"title":"What the World's Conservatives Can Learn From Narendra Modi & the BJP","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Fit_Soup_2275","created_utc":1712688053,"title":"What the World's Conservatives Can Learn From Narendra Modi & the BJP","num_comments":1,"description":"\u201cIn 2014, Scott Alexander described the phenomenon of an increasingly intolerant liberal belief system of American Democrats as the \u201cBlue Tribe.\u201d Balaji Srinivasan has recently pointed out that this belief system is not simply restricted to American Democrats anymore.

I'm 28-years-old and recently moved to Florida. I was a staunch liberal from 2015-2020ish, a left-leaning moderate until 2022, and now I consider myself to be a republican. While I was a liberal, I volunteered on numerous democrat campaigns throughout my home state and even aspired to be a democratic politician myself. However, my views began to shift when I was in law school and started to notice some serious issues with the democratic party and its platform.\n\nIn 2020, I finally started waking up. I did get the COVID vaccine, but I hated how it was pushed on us so suddenly and without much freedom of choice.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was the democratic party pandering to the woke mob regarding issues such as transgender \"women\" in women's sports and women's spaces. As a former woman athlete myself, I am horrified by the current state of athletics at all levels that allow men to compete alongside women. It's abhorrent. Of course, if you speak out against this unfair practice, you will get \"canceled\" for being \"transphobic.\" I feel like women have been totally forgotten, disrespected, and abandoned by the democratic party and I could NEVER give my support to a party that does not support me.\n\nI am also stunned and appalled by the democrat support of \"Palestine,\" and silence regarding the atrocities being committed by Hamas in Israel. Israel is a beacon of hope in the Middle East and should be fiercely defended.\n\nI am excited to align myself with the republican party and support Donald Trump in 2024. It's funny--I would've NEVER imagined myself voting for him in 2016 or even 2020, and now I am excited and proud to give him my vote in 2024.\n\nI'd love to connect with other conservatives in Central Florida! Specifically, anyone who has left the democratic party like me.

The phrase \"Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it\" has never been truer than today.\n\nThe democrat led holocaust is here\u2026\n\nThe \"anti-Israel\" liberals have succinctly proven my point. (If you don't know, an intifada is literally a terrorist act - it's what the palestinians (NOT just hamas) call their attacks on Jews \u2013 no different from a pogrom). \"Anti-Israel\" = pro-Hamas. So now those supporting the palestinians have literally proven themselves to truly be terrorists, true nazis and racist anti-semites, as the liberals are now literally calling for terror attacks right here in NYC (not Israel, but HERE; and not just on Israelis, but ALL JEWS). \n\nAll the pro-Hamas liberals who have been \u201cdemanding\u201d a ceasefire (i.e. that Israel should not defend herself) get their wish from Israel, as Israel has now offered a ceasefire on numerous occasions (in fact there was a ceasefire already in place but the palestinians broke it on October 7th) but the palestinians reject it. That tells you everything you need to know about them.\n\nInteresting that the dems, liberals and the media care so much about the lives of the \"innocent\u201d palestinians but don't at all care about the Jewish lives here in the US that they are actually targeting with terrorist acts. \n\nInstead of the liberals and racist antisemites \u201cdemanding\u201d that Israel not defend herself, if they really cared about saving the lives of \u201cinnocent\u201d palestinians (but obviously don\u2019t care about the lives of innocent Jews), why wouldn\u2019t they demand that Hamas unconditionally surrenders, returns the hostages and simply signs a peace treaty recognizing Israel\u2019s right to exist? This is all Israel ever wanted (and have offered to the palestinians countless times) and would end all of the violence (but we all know that they really don\u2019t care about the violence, rather it\u2019s just another thinly veiled form of faux outrage from the liberals and racist antisemites so that they can attack Jews and enact the annihilation of the Jews).\n\nAll the liberals and racist antisemites \"demanding\" that Israel ceasefire (but notice they never demand that the palestinians cease fire (PARTICULARLY AS HAMAS RECENTLY REJECTED A CEASEFIRE PROPOSAL), despite them continuing to launch missiles into Israel each day, even targeting Tel Aviv now, while hiding out with all of the \"civilians\", women and children and using them as human shields) don't understand that if Israel stops now they essentially tell the palestinians (as well as all of the other countries that hate Israel and want the Jews dead) that there will be no repercussions for their barbarianism, brutality and inhumane terrorist acts of murder, rape and torture of Jews - and that it will simply continue to occur over and over, until all the Jews are dead.\n\nOr perhaps they do and they are just siding with and supporting the terrorists because they WANT to see all the Jews dead, just like their original nazi brethren. We said never again and we meant it, regardless as to what the nazi antisemites who support terrorists \"demand\".\n\nAlso interesting that all these liberals and racist antisemites \"demanding\" that Israel ceasefire \"because of the 'innocent' palestinians that are being killed, injured or displaced\" never demanded that Ukraine ceasefire as a result of all of the innocent Russian civilians who are being killed, injured or displaced every day since the Ukraine\/Russia war began, despite the two situations being exactly the same - both Israel and Ukraine are defending themselves from a brutal invasion (though the atrocities committed against Jews during such invasion have been far worse and brutal than those committed against the Ukranians). It seems they only want Jews to roll over and die and not defend themselves, while these same racist antisemites demanding that the Jews effectively surrender to the terrorists who want to annihilate them fully support Ukraine and in fact support sending them billions in aide, weapons and even American troops to help them kill Russians. Also where are these antisemitic supporters of terrorism who are \"concerned\" for the \"innocent\" palestinians while China is actually ethnically cleansing Uyghur Muslims - which continues to this very day? Not a word from them regrading this ACTUAL ethnic cleansing either. Their hypocrisy and blatant hatred and racism is indisputable and ubiquitous. \n\nTHIS is what and who the liberals \/ regressives are today. Anyone who identifies as a liberal today is no different.\n\nREMEMBER: THE HAMAS-RUN GAZA MINISTRY OF HEALTH DOESN\u2019T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND COMBATANTS WHEN REPORTING \u201cCASUALTIES\u201d. IN POINT OF FACT, ISRAEL HAS THE LOWEST CIVILAIN CASUALTY RATE EVER RECORDED IN HISTORY. The US estimates that the global average civilian to combatant casualty ratio is 9:1, while Israel\u2019s ratio is currently only 1.5:1. Where do the nazi antisemites of the world get that Israel is committing genocide??\n\n[https:\/\/thepostmillennial.com\/ucla-protesters-prevent-jewish-students-zionists-from-attending-class-accessing-campus-facilities](https:\/\/thepostmillennial.com\/ucla-protesters-prevent-jewish-students-zionists-from-attending-class-accessing-campus-facilities)"},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714519881,"title":"George Washington Statue Defaced By GWU\u2019s Pro-Palestinian Protesters","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"PercyGalaxy","created_utc":1714520343,"title":"Would u vote for me?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714521091,"title":"Reporter Grills CUNY Occupier: 'We Want to Be Revolutionaries, Would You Please Bring Us Food and Water?'","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714521354,"title":"AUDIO: UCLA PD Tells Parent of Jewish Student Blocked From Entering Class Admin Won't Let Them Intervene","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714521645,"title":"College Democrats: \u2018We Commend the Bravery\u2019 of Anti-Israel Protesters","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714523210,"title":"Illegal Alien Wanted for Murder Among Nearly 2M \u2018Got-Aways\u2019 at Biden\u2019s Border","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714523240,"title":"Feds: 1.6 Million Foreign Nationals Awaiting Entry to U.S. through Biden\u2019s Parole Pipeline","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"Prestigious_Row_5829","created_utc":1714525120,"title":"Before October 7 I Was A Democrat","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"DrKD35","created_utc":1714525553,"title":"I made a custom Donald Trump theme pack that automatically rotates to a new background every 10 minutes or so(you can change this)","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"SimsStudiosLLC","created_utc":1714527745,"title":"The HORROR of a 2nd Trump Term laid out by a Woke TikToker","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714527968,"title":"Campus Protests at Level Not Seen Since Vietnam War","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714531333,"title":"WATCH: Hundreds of Anti-Israel Protesters Flood Penn Station for Train to Columbia University","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"interestingfactoid","created_utc":1714531358,"title":"Report: White House Considers Inviting Gaza Palestinians as Refugees","num_comments":67,"description":""},{"author":"KingZiggyDarthon","created_utc":1714534186,"title":"LeoTerrell blames Joe Biden for attacks on Jewish Americans ","num_comments":1,"description":"He\u2019s right \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f "},{"author":"ZeevF","created_utc":1714538495,"title":"Wife of a convicted terrorist at Columbia...surprise surprise ","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Nyxxit_N","created_utc":1714540925,"title":"Burn my flag I'll burn yours!!

At this point, how can anyone even consider voting for this complete failure, particularly given the massive damage he has directly caused to this country and every American (which includes people of all races, colors, religions, genders, classes, sexual orientations and heritages \u2013 including LEGAL immigrants).\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to argue that Biden and the dems aren\u2019t doing everything possible to literally destroy this country and place the safety and lives of every American (which includes people of all races, colors, religions, genders, classes, sexual orientations and heritages \u2013 including LEGAL immigrants) in jeopardy and grave danger.\n\nAnd the reality is that despite what they SAID would happen under President Trump (rampant inflation, $5 gas, economic collapse, loss of global respect, starting World War III, etc.), the country as well as the economy was never in better shape and there were no wars.  ISIS and Al Qaeda were gone; Russia, China and Iran were in check; and the world was far safer because we had a strong and respected leader. Now the terrorists are all back, as are Russia, China and Iran. And inflation, unemployment and crime are rampant. In addition, under President Trump the US reduced carbon emissions more than any country in the Paris Accord. EVERY BAD THING THEY SAID WOULD HAPPEN UNDER TRUMP (NONE OF WHICH EVER OCCURRED) HAS ACTUALLY OCCURRED UNDER BIDEN. SO IF YOU WERE OPPOSED TO TRUMP FOR THOSE REASONS WHICH NEVER ACTUALLY OCCURRED, THEN THERE IS ZERO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD EVER VOTE FOR BIDEN, HARRIS OR ANY DEMOCRAT AGAIN. Unless of course you are just a hypocrite filled with hate and your words mean nothing \u2013 and everything that is occurring in this country is very much your fault as well.\n\nINFLATION \u2013 INCLUDING GAS PRICES \u2013 WAS SOARING WAY BEFORE RUSSIA\/UKRAINE. This was a direct result of Biden\u2019s and the democrats\u2019 draconian policies, rampant spending, ridiculously prohibitive and expensive regulations, and massive tax increases, and now they are trying to use the war to sweep it under the rug. In addition to the fact that the massive spike in gas prices began way before Russia\/Ukraine, inflation on ALL goods had already been soaring throughout the country \u2013 food, building materials, gas, consumer goods, etc. \u2013 AND NOW THERE IS A FOOD AND A BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE \u2013 and NONE OF ANY OF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA. Yes \u2013 gas prices will increase even further now as a result of the war (and only gas \u2013 the war has no impact on the prices of any other goods that are now at historical inflationary levels), but they will increase off of an already ridiculously historically high inflationary basis that was in place before the war even began! \n\nWhile President Trump created the GREATEST economy US HISTORY (and the demographic which benefitted the most from President Trump's policies was the Black community), Biden has only occupied the White House for two years and has since created the WORST economy since the Depression \u2013 far worse than the economy he inherited, an economic crisis, an unemployment crisis, a border crisis, an energy crisis (we were completely energy independent under President Trump and didn\u2019t buy our gas from anyone else \u2013 GAS PRICES WERE SKYROCKETING UNDER BIDEN\u2019S POLICIES WAY BEFORE RUSSIA\/UKRAINE), a foreign policy crisis, terrorist organizations such as ISIS, the Taliban and Al Qaeda have regained strength (and our enemies such as Russia, Iran and China now perceive us as being weak!), crime and murders at an all-time high, a racial crisis, and a country on the brink of civil war. In short \u2013 a massive crisis of our democracy as our country has now become a socialist\u2019s haven under fascist rule. \n\nBiden destroyed an entire country (Afghanistan) over the course of a weekend (while he was on vacation no less!), while simultaneously eviscerating our own national security - giving Afghanistan to the very terrorists who assisted Bin Laden in the worst terrorist act on US soil in history and giving rise to ISIS and Al Qaeda - two terror organizations President Trump destroyed (and Biden brought them all back \u2013 and ARMED THEM with the $85 BILLION in weapons that he just left there). Not surprisingly, there was a terrorist attack immediately after in which Americans were murdered (with our own weapons no less!). AND Biden actually gave the Taliban a KILL LIST as he literally handed over to them the actual names of American civilians and allies still there!\n\nAnd now Biden is literally allowing millions of illegals - 75% OF WHOM HAVE COVID - freely cross our border into our country \u2013 untested and unvaccinated, while the rest of us have had to to mask up, lock down and lose more rights and our livelihoods. Not to mention the massive national security issues resulting from this as known terrorists have been proven to have crossed our weak border, as well as the massive drug trafficking of deadly drugs such as heroine and fentanyl that is a direct result of our now open borders \u2013 resulting in more deaths in the US than any other crime \u2013 including shootings \u2013 particularly of children.\n\nAND NOW WE HAVE POLIO AND THE MEASLES BACK \u2013 DIRECTLY A RESULT OF THE MILLIONS OF ILLEGALS ALLOWED ACROSS OUR OPEN BORDER WITHOUT EVEN BEING EXAMINED!!!\n\nInflation is now soaring \u2013 gas prices, consumer products, construction products such as lumber (which has a direct impact on home ownership). We have gone from complete energy independence under President Trump to gas shortages and lines at the pump and complete dependence upon other countries (it seems that we have regressed 50 years back to the 1970s). Unemployment is soaring. Biden\u2019s policies have literally destroyed millions of jobs. This country is on fire (quite literally in a great many cities \u2013 and Biden and the dems seem fit to not only allow it to happen, but encourage it, allowing the Antifa\/BLM terrorists burning down the cities to go free while going after political enemies with tactics that cannot be described as anything short of gestapo partisan tactics). \n\nFor those of you who voted for Biden, do you still not yet see your massive mistake and how you have contributed to the destruction of this country??? This is your doing. Furthermore, the deaths of all those Afghan people - and all of the Americans who will be killed in future terror attacks that would have never occurred under President Trump - is not just on Biden's head - but yours as well, along with any other ignorant fascist who voted for him.
