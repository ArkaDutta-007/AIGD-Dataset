        "description": "I'll stick with the United States since that is the subreddit. Here's a brief history summary.\n\nFirst Party System\n\nThe first dichotomy in American politics was between the Federalists in the north that wanted a strong central government and the Democratic-Republicans in the south that wanted a decentralized government. The urban places were mostly in north while the rural areas were overwhelmingly in the south.\n\nSecond Party System\n\nThis dichotomy only shifted slightly here. The Jacksonian Democrats in the south were more rural populists emphasizing majority rule. The Whig party in the north were more urban, but had some interesting ideas that would be contradictory in todays political climate. An unchanging originalist constitution, yet emphasis on rights of the minority. \n\nThird Party System\n\nHere is where the first ideas that will sprout modern politics were formed and it started with the anti-slavery movement. In the south there was still emphasis on rural Americans, but also even more pro-slavery. The contrast to the north and the new Republican Party that was more anti-slavery. They also adopted policies from old Whig party like national banks, high tariffs and social spending. \n\nFourth Party System\n\nHere is where a lot of modern political concepts come in. The parties were still split between Democrats in the south and Republicans in the north. The difference was the progressive movement. In the south you had populists like William Jennings Bryan that fought for workers rights in an era of increased technological advancement. Though also keeping an alliance with southern racists at the time. In the north there was the trust busting methods of Theodore Roosevelt. Both parties acquiesced to the social movements of time like the women's movement, but also the temperance movement. This was also a time starting in the 1910s of a greater expanded government. \n\nFifth Party System\n\nHere is where politics starts to look very familiar. The New Deal Coalition was central as a response to the great depression. It combined southerners and northerners in alliance to recover the economy. This alliance as time will tell was frayed with increasing liberal views from the Democratic Party from social security to rights for African Americans. \n\nSixth Party System\n\nOur current system starts with the transition of the Republican Party to the south as a real conservative party. Starting around the 1960s with Barry Goldwater and eclipsing with the successful presidency of Ronald Reagan. Since then are politics have become quite divided with the Democrats being more liberal and the Republicans being more conservative. \n\nConclusion\n\nI hope this history lesson shows some of the changes of the US political landscape. This overemphasis on right and left is a very 20th century idea. Politics is always changing, new alliances are forged and what the rest of the 21st century brings we really don't know."

        "description": "So, I wonder. If someone wasn't born in the US they can't become a president or the VP. Assuming that this person wants to change the US for the better...like really do changes that would reduce crime, poverty, increase the quality of education, get the middle class back and improve the healthcare...if you want to change all those things not just talk about them...what political position is the best to run for? \nAnother alternative, for someone with hundreds of millions of dollars might be to get as many contacts on politicians and lobby for your cause with your money, or use your foundation, accumulate money from private investors and just pump it into your goals...but I feel like it would be impossible to make a huge change without being in politics.\nSorry for the weird question, I'm a writer working out a potential storyline for my book."

        "description": "I realize this is going to trigger a lot of people - biased, inflammatory, unhinged, insane, far left yada yada.\n\nBut think about it for a second.\n\nWhen Osama Bin Laden flew those planes into those towers - I believed he deserved to die for that.\n\nI wasn't even an American at the time - you can tell by username I'm from a Muslim background (though personally am not religious at all).\n\nBut I was enraged and disgusted by the horror and sadism and insanity of it all. Murdering all those people like maniacs.\n\nAnd they made a point of targeting America's iconic landmarks - America's symbols - as a way to really defile the country and make you bleed and really hate it.\n\nSo no surprise that former President Bush made the direct connection between Jan. 6 and 911 - that their aims were similar in some ways, by defiling and pissing on the Constitution directly and elections and specifically the rights of black people to vote equal to whites.\n\nThis is what Trump threatened at 6pm on Jan. 6 *after his attack:*\n\n>These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\n\nLater though, Trump insisted:\n\n>Some of them went in, and they are hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know, they had great relationships.\u201d\n\nLove and peace? Hugs and kisses?\n\n**This is what Capitol Police - some of them actual military veterans - had to say about what they experienced first hand:**\n\n>**What we were subjected to that day was like something from a medieval battle. We fought hand to hand ... the rioters that attempted to reach the Capitol were shouting, 'Trump sent us' ... I recall thinking to myself, 'this is how I'm gonna die' - US Capitol Sgt Aquilino Gonell**\n\nSo Trump watches his followers *brutally* beat and torture Capitol Police - and then proclaims his love for them and calls them very peaceful over and over.\n\nThis is wrong in a way that cuts your soul. Like Jan. 6 was just a game to him - like he was just playing with his action figures and smashing them together. Except we're all real people getting hurt.\n\nThis is the Republican President of the United States remember - it is literally his job to peacefully transfer power to ensure the survival of the republic.\n\nAmerica would not have survived as a country if other president's refused to do this and failed their jobs in the worst way imaginable like Trump just did.\n\nTrump was not an insane king or dictator like Putin and Xi - we voted to put him in power. Why? When he was always insisting he would fail it in the worst way imaginable?\n\nWhy are the rules fundamentally different for Trump and all Republican politicians - they can do things to people, torture them - you know they whipped the cops chanting N\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*! at them? - and it doesn't matter because their followers will never believe the GOP is dangerous to all of us."

I don't want to validate the stuff that your right-wing media puts out, but it seems to me that it's unlikely that Biden can win another Presidential election. Even the most pro-Democrat/progress talk show hosts I watch are regularly bringing up footage of him being confused on a regular basis. Sure, if Trump gets the nomination there might be enough who are motivated to stop him that they vote Biden, but even still . . .  It's hard for anyone to argue that he represents the future of the Democratic party or America. I just feel like giving him a free run is the Democrats basically forfeiting the election."

That is most obviously not the way it works and they truly know it and yet their claims to catastrophe is still echoing through the halls of congress."

They are deliberately failing and causing disasters so that we will obviously be horrified and call them the racist cult they are. Republican voters are then trained to feel personally insulted and fight back while the GOP masters sit back and laugh.\n\nTrump violently rapes women and kids and has Capitol Police held down and whipped and gassed for his personal amusement.\n\nAnd then he sits back and watches with delight as *tens of millions of Americans fight to insist he did nothing wrong and Democrats and antifah are also to blame.*\n\nThese are tactics.

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "\nA powerful Senate Republican is demanding answers from a private-equity backed hospital in southeast Iowa amid revelations that a male nurse practitioner at the facility sexually assaulted nine female patients there in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe facility, Ottumwa Regional Health Center, is part of Lifepoint Health Inc., a hospital system headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee, and owned by Apollo Global Management, the huge private-equity firm in New York co-founded by Leon Black.\n\n\nThe incidents at the Ottumwa facility came to light late last year after the overdose death in the hospital of Devin Caraccio, 27, a certified nurse practitioner who was a contract employee at the hospital, according to its spokeswoman. After he died on the job in October, the Ottumwa police accessed his cellphone, finding photo and video evidence that he had assaulted the patients, according to a police department investigator, Jeremy Tosh. \n\nThe police department said in a statement in December that \u201cIt is suspected that all of the victims were asleep, or in a state of unconsciousness when the assaults took place.\u201d Two of the victims have not yet been identified; two were under 18, Tosh said in an interview last week.\n\nEight-term Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa sent a letter last month to the hospital, Lifepoint Health and Apollo\u2019s chief executive, Marc Rowan. In it, he asked whether financial practices had reduced money for patient care and may have facilitated the sexual assault.\n\nChuck Grassley\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, at the Capitol in March 2022. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call Inc. via Getty Images file\nOne of Grassley\u2019s questions was whether Apollo contractually shields itself from liability for activities that occur at hospitals it invests in, operates or manages. He also asked Apollo to detail its \u201cexpertise regarding rural or non-urban hospitals.\u201d\n\n\nA spokeswoman for Apollo said: \u201cOur funds are investors in Lifepoint and we are responding to the questions from Senator Grassley\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Ottumwa Regional, Lifepoint has more than 60 acute care hospitals in 17 states, including Arizona, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. The facility in Ottumwa, a town of 25,000, is one of many rural hospitals owned by Lifepoint; it is the only hospital in the 432-square-mile county of Wapello. \n\nRural hospitals have experienced considerable financial pressure in recent years, alleviated somewhat by government relief funds disbursed during the pandemic. According to research from the KFF, a nonprofit group formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation, median operating margins at rural hospitals before the pandemic were 1.5%, versus 5.2% for nonrural facilities.\n\nIn a statement, Cara Clouse, a spokeswoman for Ottumwa Regional Health Center, said the facility is committed to the safety and well-being of its patients.\n\n\u201cThe heinous acts of this former contractor clearly violate our policies and values, and our hearts are with all those affected by his misconduct,\u201d she said. \u201cOttumwa Regional continues to cooperate with law enforcement, and we have adopted a number of reforms to further strengthen our controls and security to safeguard those we serve and prevent rogue bad actors.\u201d\n\nA Lifepoint spokeswoman said that the company \u201cis deeply disturbed by the terrible acts committed by a contractor at Ottumwa Regional Health Center,\u201d and that the company is implementing \u201cnew policies and reforms to help ensure patients and their families are protected.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, private-equity firms like Apollo have spent hundreds of billions of dollars buying up health care businesses, including nursing homes, hospital staffing companies and physician practices. To finance these purchases, private-equity owners typically burden the companies they buy with debt, then slash the companies\u2019 costs to increase earnings and appeal to potential buyers down the road.  \n\n\nHCA Healthcare's low staffing levels accused of endangering patients\nIn the business of health care, the drive for profits can run counter to the goal of helping patients, critics say. \n\n\nCaraccio\u2019s assaults on patients raise \"serious questions with respect to whether these hospitals have the right resources or if they are being loaded with overwhelming amounts of debt to the point where they are forced to shift money away from patient care,\u201d Grassley wrote in his letter. It also went to the CEO of Lifepoint Health; the chief executive of Warburg Pincus, another private-equity firm that owned Ottumwa Regional Health Center before Apollo bought it; and the CEO of Medical Properties Trust, a real estate investment company that had conducted a financial transaction involving the facility. \n\n\nApollo bought the Ottumwa facility in 2015 from Warburg Pincus, and it became part of RegionalCare Hospital Partners. A flurry of transactions followed: The next year, Apollo merged RegionalCare with Capella, another health care company, and in 2018 Apollo merged those operations with Lifepoint Health. \n\nThen, in 2019, Medical Properties Trust bought the real estate under 10 Lifepoint hospitals, including Ottumwa Regional, leasing them back to the facilities. Private-equity firms often conduct such transactions, generating cash for themselves and their partners from the sale of real estate underlying the facilities, but often saddling the hospitals with increased costs in rents. \n\nThe sale and leaseback of the real estate in Ottumwa does not appear to have added to the facility\u2019s rental costs, according to a person briefed on the transaction.\n\n\nNevertheless, such transactions are a concern to Grassley. \u201cThe constant selling and reselling of hospital assets by private equity, private capital, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and other related entities raises questions with respect to whether these financial maneuvers have negatively impacted the resources and thereby the care our nation\u2019s rural hospitals provide to their patients,\u201d he noted in his letter.\n\nThe Lifepoint spokeswoman said: \u201cThe actions of this one disturbed individual do not reflect who we are, our core values, or how we operate any hospital and in no way can be linked to Ottumwa Regional\u2019s financial standing. Lifepoint is proud of the substantial investments we have made since becoming a part of the Ottumwa community in 2018, including the more than $31 million in facility and technology updates and for physician recruitment and retention.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Grassley said the investigation by his office is ongoing. The recipients of his letter were asked to respond by Friday, March 31. The spokeswoman for the hospital declined to comment on the letter."

[Notice, 911 operator didn't ask at this point, so, the silent conversation was bobo frantically getting her son to lie]\n\nThen, Boebert grabs the phone and says \"he doesn't need any help. There was an argument but.. etc etc\"\n\nCall me crazy, but it sure looks like she intervened, got her son to retract his initial story, grabbed the phone and essentially played the intercept game to shield her abusive husband, who, her own son just told the world, has just been beaten by his father. Huh... mother of the year indeed. \n\nHer poor son. Between the rock of a physically abusive father and the hard place of an idiotic facist mum who'd lie and cover for her husband."

We all know the answer is no."

He's the hospital's chief of staff.\n\nANDREW FENTON: If you're a sick patient, you're trying to convalesce, and you're in the emergency department, and the lights are on, and there's alarms beeping, it's just - it's not the correct place.\n\nMCCLURG: And he says patients can deteriorate or even die waiting for the specialized care they need. For example, when a stone from a gallbladder infection must be removed, if a specialist isn't available to do it, the infection can become septic and lethal. The same is true if a patient has an aneurysm bleed and a neurosurgeon isn't available. All across the country, there are not enough specialty doctors - especially docs willing to work on-call shifts inside hospitals.\n\nFENTON: We recently lost ENT. We used to have ear, nose and throat call. They're gone now. We don't have ophthalmology. We don't have plastic surgery, oral maxillofacial surgery.\n\nMCCLURG: Meanwhile, the ER is completely full. The hallway is lined with patients waiting on gurneys. One bleeds from a head injury. Another has lacerations on his face. Doctors have even transformed a small office near the waiting room into an exam room to evaluate more patients.\n\nFENTON: It looks a little bit like a MASH unit right now when you come into the ER. It's not pretty.\n\nMCCLURG: Bottlenecks inside the ER are not new, and neither are staff shortages. But both have been exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nDONALDO HERNANDEZ: It's hard. It will get nothing but worse.\n\nMCCLURG: That's Dr. Donaldo Hernandez. He is the president of the California Medical Association. Even he can't get in to see a specialist. Hernandez needs to see a gastroenterologist for some preventive care. He called his health plan recently. The next available appointment is four months out."

So I\u2019m a bit of a history nerd and lately I\u2019ve gotten very interested in civics and US history and am currently learning about the US territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virginia islands etc. ) \n\nDuring my research of these territories (specifically policies they have to follow and their relationship to mainland US) I\u2019ve read contradictory claims such as they have no representation in congress, or very little, or some do and some don\u2019t etc. I also read they do follow the jurisdiction of the US though. \n\nSo with that, I\u2019m a bit confused, If these territories fall under the jurisdiction of the US why do they not have full representation in congress ? (Both in the senate & HOR) \n\nAs a history nerd, as it stands with my limited knowledge, I can\u2019t help draw parallels to the founding of the US, how one of the original colonies biggest gripes was taxation without representation why then would we do the exact same thing with these territories ? Am I lost? Or is that the situation ? TIA I tried to keep this short apologies"

        "description": "One glaring example of why there is a need for more, not less, CDC public health services is Mississippi\u2019s 900% increase in cases of congenital syphilis over the past six years. Congenital syphilis is associated with the rapid rise in the number of stillbirths and infant deaths, both directly attributable to inadequate prenatal health care. If the CDC is unable to meet the current demands for controlling a well-studied disease like syphilis with current budget resources, it will be woefully unable to prepare for, much less deal with, the next vector or food-borne illness. It is not a question of whether such an illness will occur; it is simply a question of when.\n\nIn addition to its staff employees, the CDC relies on approximately 6,000 contractors. The five major categories of government contractual procurement are construction, supplies and materials, professional services, information technology, and transportation. Contractors deliver everything from paper clips to medications. With fewer contractors, supply chain disruption will be inevitable. Cuts to their ranks will likely occur earlier than staff cuts because contractors act independently and are not considered government employees.\n\nCutting the CDC budget sends a message that will weaken the already anemic private sector willingness to invest in health care. If the U.S. government is cutting its investment in health care, why shouldn\u2019t the private sector do the same?\n\nThe effect will likely result in curtailment or elimination of many private sector research projects and will make prospects for new research dire. The cuts come at a time when biotechnology and big pharma are already experiencing a steep downturn in both investment and hiring in research for new diagnostics and therapeutics. This compounding effect of decreased federal funding and disinterest in private sector funding is a formula for scientific regression not seen in decades. The toll on the researchers and innovators will be devastating."

Ron DeSantis of Florida, Never Back Down, has effectively taken over his presidential campaign. Super PACs are barred by law from strategizing in private with campaigns, so they sometimes post documents in the open.\n\n\nBy Jonathan Swan, Shane Goldmacher and Maggie Haberman\nAug. 17, 2023\nUpdated 11:27 a.m. ET\n\nRon DeSantis needs \u201cto take a sledgehammer\u201d to Vivek Ramaswamy, the political newcomer who is rising in the polls.

Defend Donald Trump in absentia in response to a Chris Christie attack.\u201d\n\nThe documents were posted this week on the website of Axiom Strategies, the company owned by Jeff Roe, the chief strategist of Mr. DeSantis\u2019s super PAC, Never Back Down.\n\nThe New York Times was alerted to the existence of the documents by a person not connected to the DeSantis campaign or the super PAC. After The Times reached out to Never Back Down for comment on Thursday, the group removed from the website a key memo summarizing the suggested strategy for the debate.\n\nSuper PACs are barred by law from strategizing in private with political campaigns. To avoid running afoul of those rules, it is not unusual for the outside groups to post polling documents in the open, albeit in an obscure corner of the internet where insiders know to look.\n\nPosting such documents online is risky \u2014 the news media or rivals can discover them, and the advice can prove embarrassing. But super PACs often decide the risk is justified to convey what they consider crucial nonpublic information to the candidate without violating the law.\n\nBut it is unusual, as appears to be the case, for a super PAC, or a consulting firm working for it, to post documents on its own website \u2014 and in such expansive detail, down to the exact estimate of turnout in the Iowa caucuses (\u201cnow 216,561\u201d), and including one New Hampshire poll with more than 400 pages of detailed findings.\n\nThe DeSantis super PAC and campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNotably missing from the debate materials is a document focused on Mr. Trump. The former president, who has said he is unlikely to participate in the debate, is also not among the candidates whose previous attacks against Mr. DeSantis were highlighted by the super PAC, in a preview of what he might expect onstage.\n\nKey among the documents is one entitled \u201cDebate Memo,\u201d dated Aug. 15, which cynically describes how Mr. DeSantis \u2014 who has been battered by critical coverage and has struggled to capture attention in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s indictments \u2014 could wring the most favorable media attention from the debate.\n\nAddressed simply to \u201cinterested parties,\u201d the memo describes \u201cRoger Ailes\u2019 Orchestra Pit Theory,\u201d quoting the now-deceased Fox News executive and political strategist\u2019s well-known maxim that a candidate who lays out a comprehensive plan on foreign policy will draw less coverage than the one who accidentally falls off the debate stage.\n\nTo that end, the memo lists \u201cpotential Orchestra Pit Moments,\u201d beginning with one drama-making opportunity, complete with a recommendation for a Trump-style insult: \u201cTake a sledgehammer to Vivek Ramaswamy: \u2018Fake Vivek\u2019 Or \u2018Vivek the Fake.\u2019\u201d \""

        "description": "A coalition of 25 state governors announced a major push to reach 20 million deployed heat pumps by 2030, they said in New York City on Thursday.\n\nThat would represent a quadrupling of the 4.8 million heat pumps that were installed in the United States in 2020, according to a analysis of the announcement from RMI, independent, non-partisan, nonprofit clean energy think tank.\n\n\nHeat pumps are energy efficient replacements for fossil fuel powered furnaces and air conditioners. They use electricity to transfer heat, as opposed to generate heat, and they can either heat a building when it is cold outside or cool a building when it is hot outside.\n\nCompared to a gas boiler, heat pumps reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% when operating on emissions-intensive electricity and as much as 80% compared when operating on cleaner electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. The operation of buildings accounts for 30% of global energy consumption and 26% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IEA.\n\nHeat pumps can also save consumers money -- around $300 a year in the United States, according to the IEA. In places like Europe, where gas prices are higher, having a heat pump can save customers around $900 a year, the IEA says."

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "If Donald Trump were to be convicted in Georgia or at the federal level, the impact on the 2024 U.S. elections would be multifaceted and substantial. Conviction at either level would likely dampen his eligibility or even legally bar him from running for office, depending on the nature of the conviction. A felony conviction, for example, could render him ineligible under many states' electoral laws. \n\nThe immediate effect would be a power vacuum within the Republican Party. Trump has a significant base that wields considerable influence, and his absence from the electoral scene would create a scramble among potential successors to win over this constituency. However, some in the GOP who seek a return to pre-Trump conservatism may see this as an opportunity to redirect the party\u2019s course, which could result in internal fractures and ideological battles. \n\nOn the Democratic side, a Trump conviction could be used as political ammunition to critique the Republican Party as a whole, further galvanizing their base. However, there's a caveat: the absence of Trump could make it more challenging for Democrats to rally their base against a common adversary, especially if the GOP nominee is less polarizing.\n\nMoreover, public sentiment could be a wildcard. A portion of Trump\u2019s base may see the conviction as politically motivated, possibly leading to protests or even civil unrest. This could invigorate or alienate independent voters, depending on their view of the justice system's integrity and the political climate at that time.\n\nOverall, a conviction would send ripple effects throughout the American political landscape, reshaping party dynamics, public sentiment, and strategic campaigning for 2024."

The AI can teach a bunch of people the basics really quickly. These folks can then use the AI to help make solid medical calls, something that the AI is already really good at. So you end up with this awesome team where each one makes the other better. The AI gets the human touch, and the human gets to tap into some high-level medical know-how. Sounds like a win-win to me."

        "description": "Ah, you're looking for a \"Hail Mary\" kind of moment, something straight out of a movie where the skies part and everyone suddenly sees the light. In a miraculous scenario, let's say Trump himself has an epiphany. He goes on live television, unscripted and clearly genuine, admitting to falsehoods, manipulations, and outlining the damage done. In this moment, he not only repents but also provides clear, undeniable proof of his actions, all while urging his followers to mend the divides they've contributed to.\n\nThis act would need to be coupled with real-time validation from trusted figures in the Trump-supporting community. Imagine Fox News anchors, right-wing radio hosts, and online influencers simultaneously admitting they were wrong, all struck by this bolt of collective conscience. They amplify Trump's message and begin actively working toward unity.\n\nSimultaneously, social algorithms morph in a way that promotes only factual, unifying content, eliminating echo chambers overnight. Conspiracy theories lose their digital oxygen, and fact-based dialogue fills the void.\n\nThis perfect storm of individual and collective awakening, backed by technological intervention, creates a seismic shift in public opinion. It's miraculous not because it's impossible but because it requires so many stars to align simultaneously.\n\nSuch an event would transcend mere evidence and tap into emotional, psychological, and even spiritual dimensions of human behavior. Then you'd have your miracle."

I had forgotten that shutdown began in December 2018. As Jeffries just told the GOP, they shut themselves down. They had the WH, the House of Reps, and the Senate in 2018. And they managed to shut the government coz bunker boy wanted ~$6 bn for his idiotic border wall. He spent months blarting \"Mexico will pay for it\", then immediately tried to saddle the US taxpayer with that little monstrous vanity project.\n\nAn interesting detail which shouldn't be forgotten is that after the government re-opened, Orange blocked the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from his 35 days shutdown. This moved both houses to pass a veto-proof bill telling him where to stick it.\n\nThe above is relevant because the folks on the GOP side who've been calling for the shutdown are doing so on behalf of and at the behest of one Orange tinyhands drumpf."

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "Adam Kinzinger would be a good choice for Speaker of the House for a number of reasons:\n\n* **He is a principled conservative.** Kinzinger is a strong supporter of traditional Republican values, such as limited government, free markets, and individual liberty. He has a proven track record of fighting for these values in Congress.\n* **He is a bipartisan legislator.** Kinzinger is one of the most bipartisan members of Congress. He has a history of working with Democrats to pass legislation that benefits the American people. This would be an asset in a Speaker of the House, who needs to be able to build consensus and get things done.\n* **He is a strong defender of democracy.** Kinzinger has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump and his attempts to undermine American democracy. He is a strong believer in the rule of law and the importance of free and fair elections. This would be important for a Speaker of the House, who is responsible for protecting the integrity of the legislative process.\n* **He is a clear communicator.** Kinzinger is a skilled communicator who is able to explain complex issues in a way that is easy to understand. This would be important for a Speaker of the House, who needs to be able to rally the public behind important legislation.\n\nIn addition to these general qualities, Kinzinger also has some specific experiences that would make him well-suited for the Speakership. For example, he served on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, and he has experience working on both domestic and foreign policy issues.\n\nOverall, Adam Kinzinger would be a strong and effective Speaker of the House. He is a principled conservative, a bipartisan legislator, a strong defender of democracy, and a clear communicator. He has the experience and the skills necessary to lead the House of Representatives and to help the country heal from the divisions of recent years.\n\nHere are some specific examples of Kinzinger's bipartisanship and commitment to democracy:\n\n* He was one of 13 House Republicans to vote with a majority of Democrats for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n* He was one of the few Republicans to publicly criticize Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n* He has called for a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6th attack on the Capitol.\n* He has spoken out against extremism in both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nKinzinger is a true statesman who is committed to serving the American people. He would be a breath of fresh air in the House of Representatives and would help to restore the institution's reputation."

There are a few possible explanations for this.\n\nOne possibility is that President Biden did not want to alienate his Israeli allies. The United States and Israel have a close relationship, and President Biden may have felt that it was not the right time to criticize Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.\n\nAnother possibility is that President Biden did not want to focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during his speech, which was primarily focused on the war in Ukraine. President Biden may have felt that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a complex issue that deserves its own attention, and that it was not appropriate to discuss it in the context of a speech about the war in Ukraine.\n\nIt is also possible that President Biden believes that the best way to help the Palestinians is to work privately with the Israeli government to address their concerns. President Biden may have felt that it was not necessary to mention the Palestinians in his speech in order to make progress on this issue.\n\nUltimately, only President Biden knows why he did not mention the Palestinians in his speech today. However, the possible explanations listed above are all plausible.\n\nBard"

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "Whether Hamas and the Republican Party should be condemned as terrorist organizations for their attacks on Israel and the United States, respectively, is a complex question with no easy answer.\n\n**Hamas** is a Palestinian Sunni-Islamist fundamentalist military organization based in the Gaza Strip. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Hamas's stated goal is to establish an independent Islamic state in Palestine, replacing the State of Israel.\n\n**The Republican Party** is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States. It is generally considered to be center-right on the political spectrum. The Republican Party's platform is based on American conservatism, and it supports free-market capitalism, limited government, individual liberty, a strong national defense, and traditional values.\n\n**On January 6, 2021**, a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol Building in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The attack was widely condemned as an act of insurrection and domestic terrorism.\n\nThere are a number of key differences between Hamas and the Republican Party that may explain why Hamas is more widely condemned as a terrorist organization.\n\n* **Hamas has a long history of carrying out terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians.** These attacks have included suicide bombings, rocket attacks, and kidnappings. The Republican Party, on the other hand, has no history of carrying out terrorist attacks against American civilians.\n* **Hamas is explicitly committed to the use of violence to achieve its political goals.** The Republican Party is not. In fact, the Republican Party platform explicitly condemns terrorism.\n* **Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other Western countries.** The Republican Party is not.\n\nSome people argue that the Republican Party should be condemned as a terrorist organization for its attack on the United States Capitol on January 6th. They point out that the attack was an attempt to overturn the results of a democratic election and to undermine the American government. They also argue that the Republican Party's rhetoric and actions in the lead-up to the attack incited violence.\n\nOthers argue that the Republican Party should not be condemned as a terrorist organization. They point out that the attack on the Capitol was carried out by a small group of extremists and that the Republican Party as a whole does not support violence. They also argue that the Republican Party is a legitimate political party and that condemning it as a terrorist organization would be a dangerous precedent to set.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether Hamas and the Republican Party should be condemned as terrorist organizations is a matter of opinion. There are strong arguments to be made on both sides.\n\nBard"

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "There are a number of factors that could cause the United States to support a two-state plan to end the war in Israel. These include:\n\n* **A change in Israeli public opinion:** If there is a significant increase in support for a two-state solution among Israeli voters, the US government may be more likely to pressure Israel to pursue this option.\n* **A regional initiative:** If a group of Arab countries were to come forward with a comprehensive peace proposal that includes a two-state solution, the US government may be more likely to support it.\n* **A new US administration:** If a US administration is elected that is more committed to the two-state solution, it may be more likely to put pressure on both sides to reach an agreement.\n* **A humanitarian crisis:** If the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorates significantly, the US government may be more likely to support a two-state solution as a way to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people.\n* **A growing threat from Iran:** If the US government perceives Iran as a growing threat, it may be more likely to support a two-state solution as a way to promote stability in the region.\n\nIt is important to note that there are also a number of factors that could prevent the United States from supporting a two-state solution. These include:\n\n* **The political situation in Israel:** If the Israeli government is opposed to a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to pressure Israel to pursue this option.\n* **The domestic political climate in the US:** If the US public is not supportive of a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to take a leading role in promoting it.\n* **The opposition of regional actors:** If key regional actors, such as Iran and Syria, are opposed to a two-state solution, it will be difficult for the US government to implement it.\n\nOverall, the decision of whether or not to support a two-state solution is a complex one that will be influenced by a variety of factors. The US government has traditionally supported a two-state solution, but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so if the current situation does not change.\n\nBard"

        "description": "When the news media gets stuck reporting the devastation of the Israel-Hamas war without moving on to its speedy resolution, a number of things can happen:\n\n* **Public fatigue.** People can become tired of hearing about the same conflict over and over again, especially if there is no clear end in sight. This can lead to a decrease in public attention to the issue, and can make it more difficult to build support for diplomatic or political solutions.\n* **Desensitization.** The constant exposure to images and stories of violence and death can desensitize people to the human cost of the conflict. This can make it more difficult for people to empathize with the victims of the war, and can make it easier for governments to justify continued military action.\n* **Misinformation and propaganda.** Both sides in the conflict may use the media to spread misinformation and propaganda. This can make it difficult for people to understand the real dynamics of the conflict, and can make it easier for governments to manipulate public opinion.\n* **Polarization.** The media coverage of the conflict can also contribute to polarization, as different outlets focus on different aspects of the story and cater to different audiences. This can make it more difficult to find common ground and to build consensus on a solution to the conflict.\n\nIn addition, if the news media gets stuck reporting on the devastation of the war, it may miss out on other important stories. The world is a complex place, and there are many other issues that deserve attention. By focusing too much on the Israel-Hamas war, the media may be neglecting other important stories that could have a significant impact on people's lives.\n\nIt is important to note that the Israel-Hamas war is a complex issue with no easy solutions. However, it is also important for the news media to provide balanced and comprehensive coverage of the conflict, and to avoid getting stuck in a cycle of reporting on the devastation without also moving on to discuss possible solutions."

It would allow some softening of postures and relieve the heightened war tensions that are creating nothing but ire in the Middle East for Israel and the United States. \nNow is the precise moment to make this happen and use humanitarian aid as an invitation to negotiations for a lasting 2 state solution that is fair and equitable for both Palestinians and Israelis. Hamas itself can be dealt with as a separate issue, a direct issue of terrorism. And it can be asked of Palestinians whether they want peace by expelling Hamas or they will side with terrorism and lose this golden opportunity to secure their borders and future. \nEveryone in this region needs to help Palestinians and Israelis to understand what a Middle East war at this moment in time means for both sides. There will likely be no winners and there\u2019s unlikely to be a better outcome afterward. Now is the time to get international diplomacy right for a change. \nLet your hearts lead your hands to doing what is right and just for the Palestinian people.  To have their own land, lives and government that they choose and freedom from destructive influences."

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": " .\n\nImagine walking into an emergency room in your moment of crisis\u2014in desperate need of a physician\u2019s care\u2014and finding no one there to take care of you.\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\n\nAnd so while our current physician shortage is already limiting access to care for millions of people, it\u2019s about to get much worse.\n\nConsider that roughly two in three doctors admitted to experiencing burnout during the pandemic, according to a survey from the AMA, the Mayo Clinic and Stanford Medicine. That\u2019s the highest level of burnout ever recorded by the AMA.\n\nConsider that one in five physicians surveyed during the pandemic said they planned to leave medicine within the next two years, while one in three said they\u2019d cut back on their hours.\n\nConsider that nearly half of all practicing physicians in the U.S. today are over age 55. And while medical school applications are up, it can take a decade or more to educate and train a physician.\n\nConsider that foreign-trained physicians, called International Medical Graduates or IMGs, face enormous obstacles\u2014such as immigration and green-card delays\u2014to practice medicine in the U.S.\n\nConsider that the average young doctor now leaves medical school more than $250,000 in debt, and that this heavy debt load has huge implications for our health system, often forcing aspiring physicians to bypass primary care and less populated, rural areas in favor of more lucrative specialties in or near large cities.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder why the American Association of Medical Colleges projects a national physician shortfall of at least 37,000\u2014and possibly well over 100,000\u2014 over the next decade.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nAsk physicians and they\u2019ll tell you:\n\nAn increasingly impersonal and bureaucratic health care system that places enormous administrative hassles and burdens in our lap each day, and leaves us feeling powerless to make any meaningful change.\n\nPhysicians today, on average, spend about two hours on paperwork for every one hour we spend with patients.  \n\nAn attack on science that undermines trust in our medical institutions, and too often leads to threats and hostility directed at us and other health care workers.  \n\nGovernment intrusion into health care decisions and aggressive efforts in many states to criminalize care supported by science and evidence.  \n\nIncreasing consolidation across health care that is giving more power to our nation\u2019s largest hospitals, health systems and insurers, and less autonomy and fewer choices to patients and doctors.  \n\nWidening health disparities for historically marginalized communities, by race and by gender, between wealthy and low-income, and people living in urban and rural settings.  \n\nThe twin health crises of firearm violence and drug overdose. \n\n* And for the last 20 years, a shrinking Medicare reimbursement rate for physicians that has pushed many small, independent practices to the brink of financial collapse and jeopardized care for millions of America\u2019s seniors."

Oral rabies vaccination projects are targeting coyotes to prevent the reemergence of canine rabies in the US. The program has successfully eliminated grey fox rabies in Texas. APHIS\u2019 rabies control efforts protect wildlife and help protect humans from this devastating disease."

Second, his economic recovery plan takes time to produce results. Those results will more than likely really kick in in 2024 and be claimed by Republicans as their own."

        "description": "As we peer into society's future, we \u2013 you and I, and our government \u2013 must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\n\nUntil the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporations.\n\nNow this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence\u2014economic, political, even spiritual\u2014is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society.\n\nIn the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\n\nAkin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.\n\nIn this revolution, research has become central, it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.\n\n...\n\nThe prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocation, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.\n\nYet in holding scientific discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite."

It is overly apparent that legislation is not in the best interest of the people but of those in control.\n\nConspiracy theories aside, if you vote either Democrat or Republican in the upcoming election then you are allowing the status quo to continue and you are part of the problem. \n\nHow can we allow this to continue while complaining about the state of the economy and government amidst this rampant dissent and mistrust from all of us?\n\nI fully expect this post to be downvoted, removed or myself banned, because I believe that the same shadowy decision makers have infiltrated this once great social media platform.\n\nHowever, I also believe in the amazing power of Reddit and likewise all of you incredible fellow people reading this right now.\n\nPlease, I implore all of you, be extraordinarily brave and do whatever you can to disrupt this endless cycle of a forced binary charade of electing puppets controlled by entities who will never care about your quality of life.\n\nDo you know the real reason why RFK\u2019s siblings hate him?\n\nHe wants to hold them and all other billionaires accountable for their gross misconduct of financial power and the resulting harm done to the the American people."

It's a better idea than trying to build a wall (cough cough Trump) or letting migrants come in all Willy Nilly without legal documentation (cough cough Biden). \n\nTurning countries into states would be a good thing because we can fix any dumb laws that country has and impliment ours. For example, Colombia has a problem with theives stealing phones and no one is doing anything about except saying \"Oh I wanna go to the United States so badly, but it's hard to get a Visa\". That and their  current President (Gustavo Petro) is so corrupt that he's releasing prisoners for no reason. If we bought Colombia and turned it into a state, then we can offer these Colombians the right to bear arms so that they can fight back and impeach Petro by electing a real American Governor to run Colombia.\n\nAnother reason to buy other countries is to have the numbers and strength to keep Vladimir Puta at bay. The more land we have, the less likely he'll keep fucking around with his KGB commie ideals that he's putting on Ukraine.\n\nThe whole world needs a taste of American freedom. You don't hear Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands complaining.\n\n#Annex_Latin_America_and_Africa"
