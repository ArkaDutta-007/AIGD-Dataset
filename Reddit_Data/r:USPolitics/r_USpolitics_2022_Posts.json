        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "Here is the link for those that are curious.\n\n[Total Scores/Overall Rankings | C-SPAN Survey on Presidents 2021 | C-SPAN.org](https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/?page=overall)\n\nAfter Joe Biden became the 46th President of the United States in 2021, C-Span did their yearly rankings of US Presidents adding in Donald Trump as the 45th. The list is based on opinions from historians and categorizes US presidents on many factors from crisis leadership to moral authority. A lot of academics were interviewed for this thing and it really is a fascinating look into different leaders.\n\nFor this posting today, I tallied the different US Presidents by different eras in US politics. C-Span categorizes the scores between 0 and 1000, so I organized the US presidents based on five categories.\n\nRatings\n\n800-1000: Greatest\n\n650-800: Good\n\n500-650: Passable\n\n400-500: Below Average\n\n0-400: Worst\n\nI won't say how each president scored since that would take up too much time and the link provides all those details. All I did was tally the scores for presidents in their respective eras.\n\nEra of Good Feelings (1789-1829)\n\nGreatest: 1\n\nGood: 1\n\nPassable: 4\n\nJacksonian Era (1829-1861)\n\nPassable: 2\n\nBelow Average: 1\n\nWorst: 6\n\nRepublican Era (1861-1933)\n\nGreatest: 1\n\nGood: 1\n\nPassable: 7\n\nBelow Average: 3\n\nWorst: 3\n\nNew Deal Era (1933-1981)\n\nGreatest: 1\n\nGood: 4\n\nPassable: 1\n\nBelow Average: 2\n\nNeoliberalism (1981-Present)\n\nGood: 2\n\nPassable: 2\n\nBelow Average: 1\n\nWorst: 1\n\nTotal Presidents\n\nGreatest: 3\n\nGood: 8\n\nPassable: 16\n\nBelow Average: 7\n\nWorst: 10\n\nI found two fascinating patterns from these numbers. One, is that there were a lot of truly terrible presidents leading up to the Civil War. Whether that was more up to the quality of the leader or the historical realities they faced, the numbers are daunting. The second is that the New Deal Era produced a lot of good presidents. Much like the the first one though, was it more to do with the quality of the leader or the historical realities they faced. Only three US presidents are defined as the greatest and I agree with the historians: they are George Washington, Abraham Lincoln & Franklin Roosevelt. All three managed situations that required exceptional leadership: the founding of a new country, a civil war and a great depression."

China is about to face a very similar problem.  Economic numbers for the Chinese economy are looking very pale.\n\nSo America needs to remain patient when dealing with those rumors.  Xi is well aware the devastating possibilities for China when/if this invasion becomes more than just talk.\n\nChina's taking down Hong Kong has not gone as well as Xi wanted and neither will taking Taiwan down.\n\nSo, war with China is not a certainty and if honesty wins the day we can avoid it entirely."

I didn't catch how it ended because I got busy, bit it was interesting from what I did manage to hear.\n\nEssentially, the gentleman was talking to his lady friend about how some of his longtime friends from the Republican party had reached out to him lately. People who \"he had known forever\". \"Good people\" as he had put it. Essentially there was a pretty big rift between his buddies and these new members of the party who \"had a lot of energy and an understandable level of frustration, but who were....\".\n\n\"Crazy\", his friend cut in.\n\n\"Yeah\", he replied.\n\nI wish I had caught more of this conversation to see how it played out, but I was surprised to see these people have a moment of self reflection since I come from a very red state. Yet, it made me sad to realize though that both of these people will still most likely vote Republican next election even if half of the party is in their own words, \"nuts\". \n\n\u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201d Anyways, we're boned. Good luck folks."

The fact is he is the one stealing the election and he planned it from the very beginning.\n\nGenuinely strong candidates have no need for such total control, they know their power base and have the ability to win because of the principles and knowledge constantly at their fingertips.  They win due to the majority of voters who truly appreciate their politics.\n\nTrump's use of fear and corruption is a pure sign of weakness, he figures people dont really like him so he seeks to control them other ways."

        "description": "I've been running some numbers and seeing where the Presidential approval ties with re-election results. It's much harder to gage initial election results because new candidates don't have a polling track record. They're more unpredictable. Anyways I went through the data that FiveThirtyEight has and compared the approval rating the time of the election to the election results. Some interesting details. I'll break down what I did so it isn't confusing. The data goes back to Harry Truman's re-election in 1948. I listed their approval rating of the time of their re-election. The election results contains the electoral votes (the winner is always on the left). I didn't list who won that election, but it's pretty obvious to anyone that knows anything about US politics. The next part is the number of states won, the number of votes cast and the percentage of the vote. I didn't place all third party contenders in unless they actually won a state. That's why John Anderson and Ross Perot aren't listed.\n\n Here's the FiveThirtyEight site for those that are interested. \n\n [How Popular Is Joe Biden? | FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?cid=rrpromo) \n\n1948 Presidential Election\n\nPresident: Harry Truman\n\nApproval Rating: 69.0% (Jumped from 39.6% in a matter of days) \n\nElection Results: 303/189/39 - 28/16/4 - 24m/21m/1m - 49.6%/45.1%/2.4%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1956 Presidential Election\n\nPresident: Dwight Eisenhower\n\nApproval Rating: 67.9%\n\nElection Results: 457/73 - 41/7 - 35m/26m - 57.4%/42.0%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1964 Presidential Election\n\nPresident: Lyndon Johnson\n\nApproval Rating: 74.0%\n\nElection Results: 486/52 - 44/6 - 43m/27m - 61.1%/38.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1972 Presidential Election\n\nPresident: Richard Nixon\n\nApproval Rating: 61.3%\n\nElection Results: 520/17 - 49/1+DC - 47m/29m - 60.7%/37.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1976 Presidential Election\n\nPresident: Gerald Ford\n\nApproval Rating: 43.6%\n\nElection Results: 297/240 - 23+DC/27 - 40m/39m - 50.1%/48.0%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1980 Presidential Election\n\nPresident: Jimmy Carter\n\nApproval Rating: 37.9%\n\nElection Results: 489/49 - 44/6+DC - 43m/35m - 50.7%/41.0%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1984 Presidential Election\n\nPresident: Ronald Reagan\n\nApproval Rating: 57.9%\n\nElection Results: 525/13 - 49-1+DC - 54m/37m - 58.8%/40.6%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1992 Presidential Election\n\nPresident: George H.W.

George W. Bush and Barack Obama both had split approval ratings and had tighter elections because of that. It was however just high enough to actually get re-elected. Once you get into the early 40s Presidents like Gerald Ford and Donald Trump still have competitive elections, but ultimately lose. The 30s is where electoral landslides happen like Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. Both of them sought re-election and got clobbered. The flip side is that an approval rating of 50s and above is a strong sign for a successful re-election. Joe Biden's current approval rating is 42.2% on average and in my opinion based on the facts he would lose re-election if the election was held today. It would be a tight race, but he would lose. \n\nFascinating numbers to run through."

        "num_comments": 4,
        "description": "Third parties in the United States have always struggled to have a grasp on national politics. It always seems to be the two major parties dominating the discourse: the Democrats and Republicans. It does seem however that third parties are becoming even less relevant than they did in earlier times. I'm going to break down one of the reasons for this. \n\nThere are three elected branches of the government in the United States: the Presidency, the Senate and the House. The Presidency has always had third party challenges, but the odds of them winning are close to zero. The Senate does have more opportunities for third parties, but for most of them the populations are so high that it would take a mass movement to even win one seat. Even states like Wyoming and Vermont have such partisan entrenchments that it would be difficult. That leaves us with the House and even then there are problems.\n\nThe House of Representatives officially had 435 seats in the 1912 House elections. This was keeping with the tradition beforehand of House seats increasing based on population. One bill in particular changed this dynamic with the Apportionment Act of 1911. This bill officially set the number of House seats at 435. The bill that added to this situation was the Reapportionment Act of 1929 that established a permanent apportionment of seats based on the census every decade in the US. It's possible that these measures were used to solidify the two party system, however third parties still thrived after 1912. So what changed? Population.\n\nThe population in 1912 was roughly 95 million. Based on 435 seats each seat would have the population of about 220,000. I understand that populations do differ by seat, but they're always in the same ballpark. Compare that to 2020, the last House election where the US population is roughly 330 million. That would make about 760,000 people per seat. Over triple that of 1912. Now of course the question is why would this affect third parties? \n\nWell, the US political system much like many democracies around the world is winner take all. If you win the majority of votes you win the riding. Granted, some states have changed the rules like proportional representation and runoffs, but generally this is the rule. To win a seat requires convincing a massive population against two well established political parties. In 2022, a very difficult task.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is one reason why third parties struggle nationally."

        "description": "I contemplated whether I should post something like this since it's going to be divisive, but I found it interesting. I decided not to go over the 2024 election since I believe both Biden and Trump are obviously going to be the nominees and I think Trump is going to win. Based on the 22nd Amendment if Trump is President again he can't run in 2028. \n\nI did this exercise based purely on Google Trends statistics from yesterday. A major disclaimer is please don't take this thing seriously. I'm only basing this on google searches from yesterday and data fluctuates by the minute on the internet. Data was based on the 24 hours of Google searches yesterday and the percentages were based on searches per US state. For the primaries I stop the count when there is only one candidate left in the race. The rest are just filled in the map. For the maps in the primaries it says Dems and Reps, but it really means the primary candidates. For the general election I kept all the safe states in 270towin and used Google Trends for the swing states. I used 270towin for the election maps to get a visual idea. Here's the link if you're interested. \n\nhttp://www.270towin.com\n\nI chose for the Democratic Primary Kamala Harris, AOC, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar & Phil Murphy. For the Republican Primary Ron DeSantis, Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Nikki Haley & Larry Hogan. Obviously a lot can change from now and 2028, but I thought these were fair picks for the current political environment. \n\n2028 Democratic Primary\n\nIowa: Kamala Harris 49% AOC 42% Pete Buttigieg 5% Amy Klobuchar 3% Phil Murphy 1% \n\nNew Hampshire: AOC 59% Kamala Harris 26% Pete Buttigieg 10% Phil Murphy 4% \n\nAmy Klobuchar 1%\n\nNevada: AOC 54% Kamala Harris 39% Pete Buttigieg 6% Amy Klobuchar 1% \n\nSouth Carolina: Kamala Harris 53% AOC 46% Pete Buttigieg 1% Amy Klobuchar <1%\n\nAlabama: Kamala Harris 61% AOC 39% \n\nArkansas: AOC 63% Kamala Harris 37%\n\nCalifornia: Kamala Harris 51% AOC 49% \n\nColorado: AOC 60% Kamala Harris 40% \n\nMaine: Kamala Harris 52% AOC 48% \n\nMassachusetts: AOC 55% Kamala Harris 45%\n\nMinnesota: AOC 53% Kamala Harris 47%\n\nNorth Carolina: Kamala Harris 51% AOC 49% \n\nOklahoma: AOC 58% Kamala Harris 42% \n\nTennessee: AOC 53% Kamala Harris 47% \n\nTexas: Kamala Harris 54% AOC 46% \n\nUtah: AOC 60% Kamala Harris 40% \n\nVermont: AOC 65% Kamala Harris 35%\n\nVirginia: Kamala Harris 52% AOC 48% \n\nIdaho: AOC 57% Kamala Harris 43%\n\nMichigan: AOC 52% Kamala Harris 48%\n\nMississippi: Kamala Harris 63% AOC 37%\n\nMissouri: AOC 55% Kamala Harris 45%\n\nNorth Dakota: AOC 57% Kamala Harris 43%\n\nWashington: AOC 59% Kamala Harris 41%\n\nArizona: AOC 57% Kamala Harris 43%\n\nFlorida: Kamala Harris 54% AOC 46%\n\nIllinois: AOC 51% Kamala Harris 49%\n\nWisconsin: AOC 51% Kamala Harris 49%\n\nAlaska: AOC 56% Kamala Harris 44%\n\nWyoming: AOC 52% Kamala Harris 48%\n\nOhio: AOC 54% Kamala Harris 46% \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Blue represents AOC and Red represents Kamala Harris](https://preview.redd.it/gr0r6v51jpf81.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9150172f7006bb1193ad9f52203d4e86adc6a4a)\n\n2028 Republican Primary\n\nIowa: Ted Cruz 46% Ron DeSantis 36% Mitt Romney 10% Larry Hogan 8% \n\nNikki Haley <1%\n\nNew Hampshire: Ron DeSantis 51% Ted Cruz 34% Mitt Romney 9% Larry Hogan 6%\n\nNikki Haley 1%\n\nNevada: Ron DeSantis 53% Ted Cruz 39% Mitt Romney 6% Larry Hogan 2%\n\nSouth Carolina: Ron DeSantis 52% Ted Cruz 37% Mitt Romney 6% Larry Hogan 5%\n\nAlabama: Ron DeSantis 51% Ted Cruz 42% Mitt Romney 7%\n\nArkansas: Ted Cruz 52% Ron DeSantis 38% Mitt Romney 10%\n\nCalifornia: Ron DeSantis 47% Ted Cruz 45% Mitt Romney 8%\n\nColorado: Ron DeSantis 47% Ted Cruz 43% Mitt Romney 10%\n\nMaine: Ted Cruz 47% Ron DeSantis 45% Mitt Romney 8%\n\nMassachusetts: Ron DeSantis 54% Ted Cruz 37% Mitt Romney 9%\n\nMinnesota: Ron DeSantis 48% Ted Cruz 44% Mitt Romney 8%\n\nNorth Carolina: Ron DeSantis 50% Ted Cruz 42% Mitt Romney 8%\n\nOklahoma: Ted Cruz 63% Ron DeSantis 32% Mitt Romney 5%\n\nTennessee: Ron DeSantis 58% Ted Cruz 36% Mitt Romney 6%\n\nTexas: Ted Cruz 82% Ron DeSantis 16% Mitt Romney 2%\n\nUtah: Mitt Romney 50% Ted Cruz 33% Ron DeSantis 17%\n\nVermont: Ron DeSantis 73% Ted Cruz 27% Mitt Romney 0%\n\nVirginia: Ron DeSantis 51% Ted Cruz 41% Mitt Romney 8%\n\nIdaho: Ted Cruz 57% Ron DeSantis 43% \n\nMichigan: Ron DeSantis 53% Ted Cruz 47%\n\nMississippi: Ted Cruz 55% Ron DeSantis 45%\n\nMissouri: Ron DeSantis 51% Ted Cruz 49%\n\nNorth Dakota: Ron DeSantis 56% Ted Cruz 44%\n\nWashington: Ted Cruz 51% Ron DeSantis 49%\n\nArizona: Ron DeSantis 54% Ted Cruz 46%\n\nFlorida: Ron DeSantis 89% Ted Cruz 11%\n\nIllinois: Ron DeSantis 50% Ted Cruz 50%\n\nWisconsin: Ron DeSantis 59% Ted Cruz 41%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Blue represents Ron DeSantis, Red represents Ted Cruz & Yellow represents Mitt Romney](https://preview.redd.it/7yydxvyhjpf81.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e8e337927f34998703b0ba08ce3f816a7e8821e)\n\n2028 Presidential Election\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D) Vs.

The question that remains now is why does the US refuse to acknowledge the past atrocities committed in the name of, \u201cprosperity and advancement of civilization to ensure modernity\u201d? As long as we ignore the elephant in the room of the United States very foundation was which it was built upon. The numerous broken treaties with indigenous people and the outright expulsion and butchery of said first peoples, we have no right to proclaim liberty and justice for the very essence of this nation is built on a lie and a transcontinental slaughter to propagate nation founded in white nationalism."

The first couple days it was 50/50 but as the mentions go higher they go more pro rogan. \n\nTbh its not mentioned very much at all, there are less than 300 mentions per day until today where it peaked at 395. \n\nI find it mind of intresting seeing how it used in the real world and how it is portrayed in media. You would assume its been mentioned hundreds of thousands if times, but its really not talked about at all and is overwhelming pro rogan.\n\nI dont read op eds, I simply follow mentions of it online with tools.

        "description": "I should preface that I'm not going to focus on all of the variables on American decline since that would take multiple books, however I will explain some phenomenon.\n\nGross Domestic Product\n\nThe United States is still the largest economy on earth, but many people don't fully grasp how this happened. For hundreds of years the top economies in the world were China and India. They didn't have the largest armies or technological prowess, but they had the most people. For the vast majority of human history economies were based on people making goods and it was a slow process. The technologies that did exist made life easier, however it wasn't enough to make geopolitical waves. That changed around the mid 19th century. The Industrial Revolution was already a hundred years in the making and technology had sped up so fast that countries with smaller populations could outpace larger ones on a geopolitical scale. This was something different. The country that benefited the most from this was the United States. It was so extreme that after the Second World War the United States had an economy vastly larger than any other country. So what changed?\n\nTwo things of note is that other countries started adapting to these knew technologies at a faster pace than the United States and the value of technological progress had reached an impasse. The current trends because of this are showing countries like China and India reclaiming their status as the top economies. Here's a short Youtube video that's interesting.\n\n[Top 20 Country GDP (PPP) History & Projection (1800-2040) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-2nqd6-ZXg&list=PL017BwkTGwzYruO8V3jlRgU9vGsQE4_fH&index=217)\n\nChanging Eras\n\nIn the United States we are in what some historians call the Neoliberal Era. So what is the Neoliberal Era? Well to understand the Neoliberal Era it's good to understand what it was against. For decades the United States had been operating under the New Deal framework. Economically speaking this had to do with Keynesian economics. Government would spend on social programs, big infrastructure projects and other things. This was accommodated by a high tax base on the wealthy that even the playing field somewhat. What happened is that there were people opposed to this framework. Government programs are expensive and they weren't all productive. The higher taxes limited business opportunities and many felt that infrastructure projects were more a state and local issue. This opposition culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan, but was really presented to the mainstream with the presidential run of Barry Goldwater. This new era offered a different view. Government would spend less on social programs and would tamper with large scale projects. Taxes would be lowered and there would be more deregulation. The US would turn to globalization and the primacy of the free market. At the time the rationale for this had a point. The economy did bounce in the 1980s and 1990s. Many of the excesses of pop culture that we remember fondly happened during this time. So what changed? A few things.\n\nOne was 9/11. The Neoliberal Era was definitely about cutting government spending, but not the military. The US at that point had been in numerous military adventures around the world including in Afghanistan in the 1980s as a proxy war with the Soviet Union. It wrecked the lives of many people there and some wanted revenge and turned to extremism. The 9/11 attacks shook the United States to its core, but it also led to excesses of a bloated military with no clear mission. Traditionally militaries were meant to defeat and conquer the bad guys, but what was asked in places in Afghanistan weren't clear. Was it nation building? Stopping extremism from forming? This led to enormous amounts of public dollars going overseas, many soldiers dying and an unhappy public.\n\nAnother event was the 2008 Financial Crisis. This event was led on by people in Wall Street betting on accounts in the housing sector assuming that that market was stable. It wasn't. The presumption was that people will pay there mortgage and when somebody fails it's a minority of people. The problem is that the US was having a debt problem. Since the mid 1970s jobs in many industries had been declining. Some of it was due to technology changes, jobs being shipped overseas and one sector that was hit particularly hard was the manufacturing sector. These jobs afforded many people a comfortable middle class life. When those jobs disappeared many people still wanted to maintain their lifestyle, but couldn't afford it. So they went into debt. This spiral had been developing for decades, but it wasn't until 2008 that the bubble crashed and many people's lives were ruined. So happened next?\n\nPolitically this led to the rise of populism that we're still feeling today. It started with more grassroots organization like Occupy Wall Street and The Tea Party Movement in the early 2010s, but morphed into national political figures with the election of Donald Trump and the presidential runs of Bernie Sanders.\n\nI hope this explained some aspects of how the United States is declining. I'm not a fortune teller, but one thing I see is that as the US economy remains sluggish, the capacity to maintain a large military will decline. The Senate even recently had almost a quarter of the senators vote against the military budget which is unheard of. The political divisions will become more and more fierce where anarchy could break out prompting a dictator to quell the chaos. Alternatively this rise in populism could offer a constructive path that leads the US from the brink. An unpopular point unfortunately is that any change like that would require consent from the elite. Franklin Roosevelt was elected in the response to the Great Depression, but he himself was part of the elite. A New York blueblood, but he was intuitive. The offer was give up some of your wealth to reform society and avoid revolution. Th elites caved.\n\nWe'll see what happens this time."

        "description": "  \n\nThe Kenosha Riots and all of the subsequent press came just 3 months after the death of George Floyd. To say the least the country was in a flurry of ideas and action taken in regard to racial justice and the rising racial tensions. While not directly the cause for the now infamous riot in Kenosha, it did certainly help stir it up and explode the aftermath, being the Rittenhouse trial into nationwide fame. So now, we come to this, the case of Kyle Rittenhouse. Though officially acquitted of all charges on November 19th, was he really innocent? And was there anything the court missed?\n\nThere are two sides to the trial, the defense, and the prosecution. Their arguments will be summed up here. The Prosecution \u2013 His (Kyle Rittenhouse) possession of the Armalite Rifle 15 (AR-15) used in the shooting was illegal, He came to the riots (Kenosha riots) with the intent of killing rioters, He \u201cshouldn\u2019t have been in Kenosha\u201d, and he was under no substantial threat from Joseph Rosenbaum (dead), Anthony Huber (dead), and or Gaige Grosskreutz (injured), the three people he shot. The Defense \u2013 All of the prosecution\u2019s claims are false, more specifically, His possession and use of an AR-15 is legal, He acted purely in self-defense, and he \u201cbelongs\u201d in Kenosha.\n\nBefore any arguments can be thoroughly analyzed however, one must set the scene so any statement made in regards to the case can be easily understood. So first off, the exposition, On the afternoon of August 24th, a day after the start of the Kenosha riots, Kyle Rittenhouse drove to Kenosha Wisconsin from his hometown, Antioch Illinois, to stay with his friend Dominick Black. The next day they both went out to help clean graffiti off a local high school. As the evening drew on Kyle Rittenhouse provided medical care and put out dumpster fires at some time acquiring his AR-15 rifle which he had purchased through Dominick Black earlier that year. He and his group of multiple armed individuals continued to put out fires and try to prevent destruction of property in the area such as the Car Source business which had lost 1.5 million U.S. dollars in damages the earlier night.\n\nShooting #1 - as the time approached midnight. Rittenhouse was walking down Sheridan Road, Joseph Rosenbaum spotted Rittenhouse and proceeded to chase after him. Rittenhouse seeing this, ran into the parking lot of the \u201cBert and Rudy\u2019s\u201d Auto service business on the corner of Sheridan Road and 63rd Street. Rosenbaum at this time threw a plastic bag containing most likely, socks, deodorant, and underwear at Rittenhouse. Joshua Ziminski, a random protestor then fired a gun shot into the air, unrelated to the chase. Rittenhouse then turned around, now midway through the parking lot and pointed his firearm at Rosenbaum. After Rosenbaum continued running at Rittenhouse unaffected, he turned back around and ran towards a group of parked cars in the corner of the parking lot at the side of the business. Rittenhouse decelerated as he neared the cars, turning around with Rosenbaum less than 10 feet behind and continuing toward him, he raised his AR-15 rifle and fired 4 shots in less than a quarter of a second, killing Rosenbaum instantly. Rittenhouse then jogged from between the parked cars and around back to the now dead Rosenbaum. Richie McGinniss, a bystander, then tried to help Rosenbaum as Rittenhouse stood over the body. Rittenhouse at this time called his friend Dominick Black telling him \u201cI just killed somebody\u201d before proceeding to run back up Sheridan Road, towards the police line. \n\nShooting #2 - Word spread fast among the protestors that Rittenhouse had just killed a man, and after getting just one tenth of a mile from the first shooting, he is attacked again, at the corner of 61st and Sheridan Road. A group of protestors now hurriedly ran towards Rittenhouse, shouting \u201cget him\u201d, \u201che just shot someone\u201d, \u201cget his a\\*s\u201d. A protestor ran up to and hit Rittenhouse in the back of the head, knocking his cap off. Rittenhouse ran further until tripping and falling down. As Rittenhouse turned around, sitting up, Maurice Freeland jumped over him and kicked Rittenhouse in the upper body whether that be the arms or the head. Rittenhouse then, as Freeland was midway through the maneuver, fired two shots at him in around half a second, missing both. Directly after this, Anthony Huber went in to hit Rittenhouse with his skateboard. Huber managed to hit Rittenhouse on the shoulder and while doing so with his left hand purportedly grabbed Rittenhouse\u2019s gun. He then however, tripped on Rittenhouse\u2019s legs, falling nearly to the ground, his skateboard held in his right hand, falling flat on the pavement, brushing up against it for a just a moment. Huber continued on his original trajectory, hurriedly getting up again with his hand seemingly still gripping Rittenhouse\u2019s rifle. It is at this point that Rittenhouse, now on his back, then fired a single shot at Huber, muffled due to the proximity to Hubers chest, the shot went through his thorax hitting a multitude of vital organs. Huber now dying, released his supposed grip on Rittenhouse\u2019s rifle and his skateboard, both hands reaching towards his chest. He continued forward for a couple more steps before lying down on the ground and dying. Gaige Grosskreutz, who had been running towards Rittenhouse, stopped and ducked as the shot that killed Huber was fired. Grosskreutz was now just to the left of Rittenhouse holding a pistol but with both hands raised, slowly straightening back up from his ducking position. Rittenhouse at this moment, after seeing Grosskreutz with both hands in the air sat back up with his rifle pointed towards the ground. Grosskreutz then almost immediately put his hands down, hopping into a jog circling to the back of Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse spotted this in the corner of his eye, rapidly swiveling to face Grosskreutz. Grosskreutz now had his gun pointed towards Rittenhouse and his unoccupied left hand nearly in front of Rittenhouse\u2019s AR-15. Rittenhouse at this point then fired a single shot into Grosskreutz\u2019s right bicep, disabling his right arm as he turned the other way crutching it in is left hand, still holding the gun in his right. Rittenhouse then with no other immediate threats to him, stood up onto his feet and started walking again to the police line. Swiveling and looking around for any other assailants, he then broke into a jog before then again returning to walking and lifting his hands into the air for the police. Rittenhouse approached a police cruiser at this point trying to surrender himself. The police, not understanding, and insisting that he move out of the way so they could go deal with any injured civilians or the active shootout (which they did not know by now had ended) pepper sprayed Rittenhouse. Afterwards, Rittenhouse met up with his friend Dominick Black who drove him back to his hometown, where Rittenhouse then promptly turned himself in to a police station, just a hour after the shooting.\n\nNow, to the guilt of Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\nFirst off, was Rittenhouse\u2019s possession of an AR-15 illegal? In the state of Wisconsin local laws prohibit the possession of firearms by minors but only to an extent. The law states that minors cannot own *short barreled* shotguns and rifles and because Rittenhouse\u2019s AR-15 had a barrel longer than 16 inches, it was legal for him to own and accordingly open carry, as Wisconsin is an open carry state. It is important to note also that this means while Rittenhouse could not purchase a firearm legally at the time, it was completely legal for his friend Dominick Black to do so for him and as well that both Illinois and Wisconsin laws do not prohibit the carrying of firearms across state lines. Now, the rest of the charges are somewhat opinionated, there legal basis relying on whether or not Rittenhouse provoked the attacks (\u201cA person who provokes an attack, whether by lawful or unlawful conduct, with intent to use such an attack as an excuse to cause death or great bodily harm to his or her assailant is not entitled to claim the privilege of self-defense.\u201d) or if he acted \u201creasonably\u201d, in order to stop the threat facing him (\u201ca person is privileged to point a gun at another person in self-defense if the person reasonably believes that the threat of force is necessary to prevent or terminate what he or she reasonably believes to be an unlawful interference\u201d). As one can see, \u201creasonably\u201d, is a very opinionated word, so, while I can provide the evidence, ultimately, I cannot say for certain, whether or not he was \u201cinnocent\u201d regarding these charges, besides merely expressing my *thoughts* on the matter. So, did Rittenhouse belong in Kenosha and subsequently, have good intent? Kyle Rittenhouse\u2019s father, Mike Rittenhouse (divorced), lives in Kenosha Wisconsin and Rittenhouse visited frequently. As well as this, Kenosha is merely 21 miles from Antioch, around a 30-minute drive. These two facts bring reasonable significance to the town of Kenosha for Rittenhouse, and it can be assumed then that he had a will to protect the town. Now, for the really important part, did Rittenhouse provoke any of the attacks from the 3 assailants he injured/killed, and did he use reasonable force? Rosenbaum very openly disliked Rittenhouse for putting out a dumpster fire with a fire extinguisher which Rosenbaum was seen pushing earlier. Justice and Dylan Putnum both at the scene of the dumpster fire earlier that day (August 25th), were quoted as saying Rosenbaum said \u201cwhy did you do that\u201d in an enraged manor to Rittenhouse. There is no evidence of any other act Rittenhouse did to provoke Rosenbaum. From this, one can ascertain that Rittenhouse didn\u2019t mean to upset Rosenbaum to the point of getting in a physical confrontation. It is more likely that Rosenbaum started the conflict with Rittenhouse being that he was seen visibly agitated at Rittenhouse and had a lengthy criminal record, including sexual misconduct with minors and extensive violations in prison, being of such nature as assault on staff (10 counts), disobeying orders (15 counts), and even one count of arson, along with a plethora of other infractions clearly showing him to be of a more violent nature, as well, there is significant evidence that he was off his medication at the time. The incentives of Huber and Grosskreutz would be harder to pinpoint. While they could also be angry at Rittenhouse for disturbing their rioting. One could also argue that they, as Grosskreutz has testified, were trying to stop what they viewed as an \u201cactive shooter\u201d. Ultimately though, there two incentives would not matter, in terms of whether or not Rittenhouse provoked the attack as their interactions with Rittenhouse are captured clearly on video and Rittenhouse\u2019s earlier shooting of Rosenbaum leading to the possible mis-assessment of the scene by Huber and Grosskreutz would be excused if Rittenhouse acted reasonably in self-defense. Finally, besides the \u201cactive shooter\u201d explanation, there is no evidence Rittenhouse did anything else to provoke Huber and Grosskreutz. Now finally, was Rittenhouse justified in his carrying out of self-defense? Rittenhouse ran from Rosenbaum, tried to deter him by pointing his rifle at him, and continued on running until Rosenbaum was less than 10 feet away. 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse could either then, in this situation, have a possibly fatal brawl with 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, or shoot him. Which decision one considers reasonable is up to them but Rittenhouse\u2019s attempts at escaping and dissuading the ensuing Rosenbaum as to not have to make this decision should be taken into account. Rittenhouse ended up firing 4 shots at Rosenbaum, this could be classified as overkill, but considering that the shots were rapid, within a space of a quarter of a second, and Rittenhouse was likely very nervous, it could well be attributed to his elevated levels of stress and the very close proximity of Rosenbaum. Rittenhouse from this point on was very restrained, firing the same amount of shots as he had at Rosenbaum but dispersed among three separate targets. Rittenhouse was either on his back or butt when he made the rest of his final shots, his targets being either on top of him or just a foot or two away. Rittenhouse was cornered in a sense, surrounded by rioters and soon to be engulfed, likely severely injured or killed if he did not act.\n\nNow for the conclusion. So, was Kyle Rittenhouse innocent? It appears he was. On all accounts, His possession and use of his AR-15, was legal, He acted purely in self-defense, and he belonged in Kenosha on that night.

Run by huge companies which connect to the power grid and are politically well supported.\n\nAnd yet there are literally dozens of vertical wind generator companies that don't have the insider connections but also are far simpler and also don't have the negative side effects those big huge towers have. (large maintenance costs and bird strikes)\n\nWhy is it  that we have to put up with those huge towers when the much smaller and more efficient vertical wind generators are less costly and far easier to build and maintain?\n\nHow likely is it that the centralized electrification will be replaced by those other smaller and decentralized generators?  Seems to me it is far better.  Are we being sold a phony bill of goods?"

        "description": "There is this understandable frustration that neither of the major political parties seem to be working for the people. The Democratic Party is stuck in this never ending loop of appealing to their corporate donors while giving lip service to progressive policies. The definition of having it both ways. The Republican party is stuck in this tension between the more establishment Romney/Cheney types and whatever the hell is going on with the Trump cult. Basically, things are bad, but they've been worse. \n\nThe gilded age in the United States that started around after the Civil War and didn't really end until the New Deal Era with FDR was a time of unprecedented economic expansion and inequality. For a few it was a fantastic time to be alive. For most, it was misery. The transition that occurred during this time was people working in small agrarian farms to moving to cities to work in places like factories. Hours were long, the conditions were terrible and life was tough. The political outlets for these troubles were few since both political parties were flat out openly not representing the people. The Democratic Party represented former slave states and was an outlet for white grievance. Blacks despite no longer being slaves were routinely denied the vote and the Jim Crow era was alive. Perhaps being slightly more left wing economically than the Republican party, the policies really didn't differ that much. The Republican Party was the party of the north east and the party of big business. New York at the time was the center of commerce in not only the United States, but the world. The Republican Party dominated the gilded age and brought continual deregulation and other pro-business policies.\n\nWhat saved the United States from this nightmare was the intense grassroots organizing of the time. The fight for women's suffrage, the socialist organizations, labor protests, fights for racial equality. It was these things that brought the United States out of the perils of hell.\n\nMaybe there is a lesson somewhere."

You\u2019d be  forgiven if you  weren\u2019t fully aware. It is not trending on Twitter. Joe  Biden has mostly  stopped talking about it. The enormous moral stakes  have been brutally  ablated by a broken, farcical and, above all,  extremely boring  legislative kludge known as budget reconciliation. The  months-long saga  has turned Biden\u2019s original \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan  into the juridical  equivalent of a Warhol soup can \u2013 a ubiquitous token  evacuated of any  original meaning. \"\n\n\"...   the stakes remain what they are. Passage of the bill\u2019s  half-trillion-dollars-worth of clean energy investments would probably [spell the difference](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/21/politics/biden-climate-goals-build-back-better/index.html)   between the world\u2019s largest economy meeting its climate goals and   blowing right past them. It is not an exaggeration to say that in that   balance \u2013 between 2C and 3C of warming, between a government responsive   to and avoidant of the greatest crisis of the 21st century \u2013 hang [millions of human lives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/10/20/lancet-climate-inaction-threatens-millions/)\"\n\nI'm fairly sure this is the act its referring to: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/848/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/848/text)\n\nThere is a rally being organized in DC to demand action, which will at least bring this into the public eye: [https://fightforourfutures.com/](https://fightforourfutures.com/)"

With context it wouldn\u2019t really make sense for the flags to stand for what they did when piracy was prevalent centuries ago. Honestly I\u2019m mostly asking because sometimes they look cool but I want to understand the meaning before showing a symbol so that I don\u2019t accidentally associate myself with something I disagree with.\n\nAlso, if this isn\u2019t right the sub to ask this question, I would appreciate a suggestion for where I should ask. (r/politics doesn\u2019t allow text posts, r/PoliticalDiscussion took my question down).\nThanks"

If it wasn't for all those factors, I think you could actually make the case that guns would make people safer.\n\nAnd then politically, some of these people would be very against communism since the gun issue is a landmark point in capitalistic societies (Mostly US because of the 2nd ammendment obviously). But they don't see the irony in that both of these issues are great and theory but absolute travesties and practice. (At least according to the average gun owners self imposed definition of communism) personally I think communism can't work in practice but that's not the point, the point is that the western minded, capitalistic gun owner doesn't see the irony."

I am surprised that following the 2020 census, there will for example be new seats created in states such as California and Illinois (2 for each of the two states in this case), both states losing a seat.

        "description": "The GOP has always been the servants of big business and 99.99% of the time they serve their corporate donors nicely. It's a give and take process. I get you elected into power and you give me kickbacks. That process has hit a snag recently because the GOP isn't solely the party of big business. It is also the party of social conservatism. Over the last few years especially the LGBT community has gained wider acceptance. In turn, corporations caring about their bottom line have made more gestures to the community such as representation in media and Disney is one of them. It's not because Disney is a moral actor. They are responding to economic trends and the customer largely supports the LGBT community. The problem is that the GOP - one of the two major parties in the United States has a faction that is deeply socially conservative. To them gays are an abomination and something that needs to be removed for more traditional families as the only acceptable view. This tension in the GOP has led to Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida to challenge Disney. On the surface it may appeal to some conservatives taking on a big company like Disney, but it's far sillier. The GOP wants it both ways. They want to take bribes from corporations and set the rules of the culture. That is untenable. The GOP isn't the ones with the money.\n\nThe GOP completely deserve the mess they got themselves in. Disney is one of the largest employers in Florida and makes up a gigantic portion of the Florida economy. Without it, Florida would be swamps, alligators and surfer dudes. This is the end result of conservatives praising capitalism and free markets to a zealots degree. In capitalism a few all powerful corporations have all the power and your screams - your \"values\" mean nothing to the mighty dollar. "

        "description": "There is plenty of talk around the GOP water hole of decertifying election results from 2020.  But I cannot find any legal way for that to happen.  \n\nSince the electors from 2020 have already done their job in the electoral college and now gone home, there is no process anywhere to rescind those votes.  Maybe I am just ignorant, please educate me if they can do this, explain how it is even possible.\n\nEven if some states do vote to rescind (it remains to be seen) can they force the electoral college to reconvene and take a new vote?\n\nThe GOP needs to STFU stop this conversation about rescinding electors and just get on with life."

It was a good representation especially during the Bush Administration: flouting international law, invading sovereign countries, warrantless wiretapping, crushing dissent. Classic Lawful Evil schtick. When Donald Trump look over in 2016, the party got weird. Somehow the party went for bath salt conservatism and went full on Chaotic Evil aka The Joker. Granted, this started with the Tea Party movement and Sarah Palin, but it went bonkers with Trump and later now with new faces like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, etc. The new GOP doesn't care about caring out some master plan and even governing at all. It's all about owning the libs. Doing it for the lols. Causing as much chaos as possible."

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "I decided to give this an analysis since it explains some of the major power brokers in Washington. Most of the names won't surprise you, but where they're getting their money may. I'm using open secrets for my data and you can research this stuff on your own time if you want. I'm not counting members of the House that are running for higher office since they obviously will raise lots of money.  Without further ado.\n\n10# Jim Jordan (R)\n\nNo surprise. Jordan is one of the most passionate members in congress. Belonging to the Republican Party's Freedom Caucus he represents the parties most right wing. Over 60% of his money comes from small dollar donations which makes sense he represents the base of the party. The rest is mostly large individual contributions and almost no corporate pac money. Jordan may be ideological, but he isn't bought. He's raised 7.8 million so far this cycle.\n\n9# Marjorie Taylor Greene (R)\n\nGreene's story is similar to Jordan, but goes further. Belonging to the Republican Party's Freedom Caucus she represents the parties most right wing. Over 70% of her money comes from small dollar donations. The rest is mostly large individual contributions and almost no corporate pac money. Marjorie may be ideological, but she isn't bought. She's raised 8.4 million so far this cycle. I'll add that Marjorie has raised more small dollar money than any Republican in the House.\n\n8# Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D)\n\nNow the other end of the political spectrum . Belonging to the Democratic Party's Progressive Caucus she represents the parties most left wing. Over 70% of her money comes from small dollar donations. The rest is mostly large individual contributions and almost no corporate pac money. AOC may be ideological, but she isn't bought. She's raised 8.8 million so far this cycle. I'll add that AOC has raised more small dollar donations than any Democrat in the House.\n\n7# Liz Cheney (R)\n\nThis one may surprise you. Liz Cheney became famous for criticizing Trump for January 6th and essentially leaving Republican leadership. That hasn't stopped her from being a big fundraiser regardless. Over 60% of her money comes from large individual contributions. Not much of her money comes from small dollar donations, but also not from corporate pacs. In terms of representation, she represents the upper middle class and beyond that can afford that kind of money on politics, but isn't necessarily corrupt. She's raised 10.1 million so far this cycle.\n\n6# Dan Crenshaw (R)\n\nThis is a tricky one. Dan Crenshaw is a middle guy that balances between the parties more right wing and the moderates. Roughly 53% of his money comes from small dollar donations. The rest comes from large individual contributions though a little bit of money comes from corporate pacs at 4%. He's raised 11.8 million so far this cycle. Crenshaw is the classic politician that plays different sides. These types tend to fair better for President.\n\n5# Adam Schiff (D)\n\nChair of the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff is one of the most powerful politicians in Washington. In terms of fundraising, his story is similar to Crenshaw. 57% comes from small dollar donations. The rest comes from large individual contributions though almost no corporate pac money.  He's raised 13 million so far this cycle.\n\n4# Katie Porter (D)\n\nPorter is a rare case. Normally, politicians in swing seats are supported by the party where politicians in safe seats end up raising the money. Belonging to the Democratic Party's Progressive Caucus she represents the parties most left wing. An interesting fit, since swing seat politicians aren't known for being that ideological. About 60% of her money comes from small dollar donations. The rest comes from large individual contributions though very little corporate pac money. She's raised 13.1 million so far this cycle making her a difficult swing seat to defeat.\n\n3# Steve Scalise (R)\n\nNow onto leadership. Party leadership tends to be big fundraisers since they have high name recognition and are faces for the parties. Scalise's fundraising is strange though. Over 80% of his fundraising is labeled as other which is odd. It doesn't come from self financing, donations or pacs. He's raised 13.5 million so far this cycle.\n\n2# Nancy Pelosi (D)\n\nThe Speaker of the House is surprisingly not number one. As a leader of a major political party in a chamber of congress, her money is split pretty intelligently. 46% comes from small dollar donations while 40% comes from large individual contributions. About 5% comes from corporate pacs. As a leader representing a wide variety of people, she has a good balance of different donations. She's raised 15.3 million so far this cycle.\n\n1# Kevin McCarthy (R)\n\nMcCarthy and Pelosi basically have the same thing going on. As a leader of a major political party in a chamber of congress, his money is split well. 39% comes from small dollar donations and 32% comes from large individual contributions. 25% mysteriously comes from other so something is happening in Republican leadership. All in all, it's a good balance of different views in the party. He's raised 17.1 million so far this cycle.\n\nWhat may surprise you is that even though these 10 are the largest fundraisers, none of them are really the most corrupt in congress. Corruption doesn't show itself on television regularly. It's more sophisticated. I might do a list of some of the most corrupt politicians in the US for another time. Thanks for reading my piece."

I got the data from open secrets that labeled fundraising coming from small dollar, large dollar, pacs, self financing and others. Something that I failed to add in the last piece is that politicians can have seemingly normal fundraising efforts, but can still use others like the stock market to enrich themselves. Nancy Pelosi for example has a rather safe fundraising effort, but got in trouble for her suspicious stock trades. Corruption as you can see is multi-faceted. I'm going to focus squarely on fundraising for this analysis, because this will show some of the really bad actors in Washington. The ones just brazenly taking from corporations. I'm not ranking them for the piece, but I hope you learn something.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin (D)\n\nJoe Manchin is quite corrupt in many different ways, but just solely based on fundraising it's bad. 31% of his money comes from corporate pacs. 60% comes from large individual contributors. An embarrassing 4% comes from small dollar donations. Unlike other corrupt politicians, Manchin is in the media all the time and with these stats alone you can understand why people don't like him. \n\nRepresentative James Clyburn (D) \n\nThis one may come as a shock to some people. Clyburn is the third ranking Democrat in the House. 52% of his money comes from corporate pacs. 42% comes from large individual contributors. An embarrassing 5% comes from small dollar donations. Clyburn is an institution in Washington, being around since the early 1990s and clearly corrupt. \n\nRepresentative Steny Hoyer (D)\n\nWhile Clyburn is corrupt, Hoyer somehow tops him. 56% of his money comes from corporate pacs. 23% comes from large individual contributions. An chilling 1% of his money comes from small dollar donations. Hoyer is the second ranking Democrat in the House. He's been in office since the mid 1980s and is very corrupt. \n\nRepresentative Cathy McMorris Rogers (R) \n\nJust when you thought I was only picking on Democrats. Rogers is a pretty obscure member of congress to the general public, but is actually quite high up in Republican leadership. She's the ranking member on the energy and commerce committee. 50% of her money comes from corporate pacs. 30% comes from large individual contributions. 8% comes from small dollar donations which is better than some of these other goons. \n\nRepresentative Henry Cuellar (D)\n\nCuellar is a South Texas Democrat that is known for being conservative and pro-life in a swing seat. He's also very very corrupt. 36% of his money comes from corporate pacs. 62% comes from large individual contributions. 1% comes from small dollar donations. Cuellar holds the record for the most conservative voting record for a Democrat. Voting with the Democratic Party 45% of the time. For this, he's been challenged from the left in recent elections. \n\nRepresentative Kurt Schrader (D)\n\nKurt Schrader is a conservative Democrat from Oregon that is in a swing seat. 63% of his money comes from corporate pacs. 35% comes from large dollar contributions. 1% comes from small dollar donations. Schrader has a rather conservative voting record, voting with the Democratic Party 63% of the time. Not as egregious as Cuellar, but enough to anger the left and have a primary challenge. \n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski (R)\n\nMuch like Manchin, Murkowski draws the ire of her own party, but like Manchin she's also corrupt. 30% of her money comes from corporate pacs. 58% comes from large individual contributions. 4% comes from small dollar donations. Murkowski, Collins, Manchin & Sinema have been lumped in as obstacles to their own parties, but in terms of fundraising data only two of them can be classified as corrupt.\n\nRepresentative Frank Pallone (D)\n\nChair of the Energy and Commerce committee, Pallone is very powerful in Washington and very corrupt. 63% of his money from corporate pacs. 36% comes from large individual contributions. A whopping 0.85% comes from small dollar donations. Pallone holds the title of most corrupt politician in New Jersey which is almost impressive. \n\nRepresentative Brian Fitzpatrick (R)\n\nFitzpatrick is what is known as a moderate Republican and is in a swing seat. 42% of his money comes from corporate pacs. 46% comes from large individual contributions. 2% comes from small dollar donations. Much like Schrader and Cuellar, he fills that deciding vote factor in congress that makes these types especially prone to corruption. But in my last piece with people like Katie Porter, it doesn't have to be. \n\nRepresentative Richard Neal (D)\n\nMy last one. I found nobody that could out corrupt Richard Neal. Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, he holds a very powerful position in Washington. It's the chief committee on taxation, meaning no bill becomes law without this committee. Responsibility on the process of raising government revenues. Pretty important. 64% of his money comes from corporate pacs. 29% comes from large individual contributions. 0.08% comes from small dollar donations. Basically just over $1,000. It might be impossible to top that. \n\nI'll end by saying the reason more Democrats are on this list than Republicans is that firstly I know more about corruption within the Democratic Party. But secondly, the incentive structure of the Democratic Party makes it very prone to corruption. The Democrats have a seniority system for power. You get power based on how long you've been in Washington and the longer you're there the more likely you are to be corrupt. I might do a list of the least corrupt politicians in Washington including the House and Senate. It may retread stuff from another piece I did, but I could be helpful."

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "I've been trying to wrap my head around exactly how Nina Turner lost the open congressional seat in August of last year. There are different variables that determine election results: money, endorsements, name recognition, etc. Originally, when polls were being released Nina Turner was well ahead by 35 points. Her nearest opponent was Shontel Brown and frankly if I was a resident in that area I would have answered the same way. Brown was a local Cuyahoga County and in national politics, name recognition is almost everything. What changed was partially obviously the sheer amount of money pouring in, in particular the pro-Israel lobby that spent over $2 million dollars to defeat Turner. I'm however not convinced that that would have been enough. Money buys you a seat at the table. It doesn't guarantee victory. The endorsements changed the race in my opinion. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was the biggest national figure to endorse in the race and someone with high name recognition would have to endorse to change the game. Hillary Clinton had high name recognition. Her endorsement, which she does quite rarely changed the trajectory where Shontel Brown - a local county chairwoman beat Nina Turner by about 6 points. I will add however that campaigns needs a eureka opposition research moment to really overcome the frontrunner. The \"bowl of shit\" comment obviously landed with partisan Democrats. Add in the money and endorsements and you have a perfect storm.\n\nWe can get into the internal politics of this, but quite simply endorsements appear on the surface to be the biggest swings in election results - at least in primaries with such an avid voting bloc."

Democrats should have required a sign to posted at every new bridge, road, etc saying paid for by Joe Biden's Democratic infrastructure bill.\n\n5, Biden needs to stop trying escalating the war in Ukraine and instead looking for a peaceful way to resolve it. We have too many needs here in America to be squandering another $50 billion in Ukraine on a war that isn't our fight.\n\n6, The justice department needs to investigate the oil industry price fixing, in 2008 cost per barrel reached $136 and gas wasn't as much as it is now. The oil industry admits they are purposely keeping oil production down to increase profits. Also the Saudis signed a deal with Jarred Kushner to decrease production and they refuse to increase production now. Biden needs to play hardball with them.\n\n7, Biden needs to call for a Social Security payment increase so seniors aren't crushed by inflation. Seniors also happen to be 75% of the GOP base so this is a direct shot across their bow.\n\n8, Republicans are busy banning words, books, and ideas yet call themselves the party of freedom and yet Dems ignoring a perfect opportunity to call them out on it. You can't be pro free speech while you are burning books and creating thought crimes.\n\n9, Outlaw insider trading by Congress, the president, and the Courts and charge every one of those Senators who got the Covid briefing by Trump then told the public it was a hoax while quietly dumping all their holdings about to take a hit and buy into ones that would benefit from it like Zoom.\n\n10, Require elected officials and judges tax returns be part of the public record.\n\n11, Enact mandatory voting by all citizens of legal age with a $100 fine for not voting.\n\n12, End tax loopholes for big biz and properly fund the IRS Corp division."

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "The immigration policy in the west prior to the 1960s was pretty limited to European countries. Those numbered boomed in the late 19th century with the rise of the industrial revolution. This is where the influx of Irish, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian, etc immigrants came - particularly on the east coast. That's where you get movies like Gangs of New York (2002) and the gang wars of the time. Despite this inclusion of new people into the west it was mostly white people. The white population of 1900 was about 87.9%. The rest were the 11% or so African Americans in the states and the native populations. The numbers for African Americans in the US have actually been quite stable. Staying between 11-12%. The dramatic change happened in the 1960s where prior the number of whites stayed in the 89% area. By 2020, that number is now 61.6%. The estimate is that by the 2040s whites will be a majority minority in the US and Canada. The fastest growing group in the US is the Hispanic population that is now about 17%. The second is the Asian population at about 6%. These numbers have been growing over the last few decades and will become larger factors in western politics. Places like Canada and the United States are still desirable places for immigrants to come for a better life. There are already states where the white population is under 50%: California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey & New York. This trend will continue probably affecting the rural northern states like Wyoming last. \n\n [Demographics of the United States - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity) \n\nThis context hopefully explains some of the language being used in modern politics like \"Multi-Racial Democracy\" or \"Replacement Theory\". These are some of words thrown around in the new political reality."

        "num_comments": 2,
        "description": "Anybody that pays attention to politics knows that Senator Joe Manchin has been an obstacle to the Biden agenda particularly in 2021 with the Build Back Better bill. Some would think that his Senate challenges would be on his left with a primary challenge and they would be wrong. His problems are on his right. I have a hard time thinking any progressive would challenge Manchin in a seat that benefits the GOP, by such a large margin, but who knows. What I do know is the numbers. When Joe Manchin won his special election in 2010, West Virginia was a much less red state. The average between the 2004 and 2008 Presidential elections was about 13 points for the GOP. An obstacle for Democrats, but not impossible plus Joe Manchin was a former Governor of the state. The voters had easy name recognition with him. Considering all of this Manchin won easily in 2010 and 2012 though the average had gotten worse for Democrats. The 2008 and 2012 Presidential elections reddened the state to an average of 20 points for the GOP. By 2018, Donald Trump had made West Virginia one of the reddest states in the union, winning the state by an astonishing 42 points and making the average from 2012 to 2016, 35 points for the Republicans. Joe Manchin was still able to get a victory, but by a very narrow margin. He still had the name recognition of being a former governor and 2018 was generally a good year for Democrats, but the political realities were getting worse. As of now the 2016 and 2020 Presidential elections make West Virginia an average of 39 points for the GOP. That makes it the second reddest state in the union apart from Wyoming. Manchin's luck may have run out with Trump likely running and a political climate being more uncertain for Democrats, this may be the end for Joe Manchin."

        "description": "I've decided to score the different eras in American politics based on how competitive their elections were. I'm using Wikipedias rankings of the presidential elections. Here is the link. \n\n [List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_by_Electoral_College_margin) \n\nThe higher the number, the tighter the election and the lower the number the bigger the landslide. I'm not scoring the 2016 and 2020 elections because I'm uncertain if we're in a new era or not. There is too much ambiguity. The scores are cumulative of elections in each era. \n\nEra of Good Feelings (1788-1824)\n\n266\n\nJacksonian Era (1828-1856)\n\n258\n\nGilded Era (1860-1892)\n\n320\n\nProgressive Era (1896-1928)\n\n272\n\nNew Deal Era (1932-1976)\n\n288\n\nNeoliberal Era (1980-2012)\n\n274\n\nThe numbers are interesting because it looks like the gilded age had the tightest elections. Considering the insanity of the 1876 election, I'm not surprised. The Jacksonian era was actually pretty calm. The issue of slavery was creeping in, but the Democratic Party was very dominant in that era. The closest modern election is of course the 2000 election, which deepened the partisan divide. 2004 was actually much closer than people remember. Bush won the popular vote by 2.4% and only won by 35 electoral votes. Kerry only needed to flip two larger states. States like Ohio, Bush only won by two points and Florida was just five points. It was actually a close election, but post 9/11 sympathy was still strong. \n\nInteresting."

While what they are doing may seem like it's going to help protect everyone, it's also enabling the next slaughter. In less than two weeks we have had to experience two mass shootings, both of which were allowed to occur because of how lenient gun laws have been as both had legally purchased the guns used in the shootings. As a result of both of these monstrous acts, 31 innocent people are dead, 10 in Buffalo, 21 in Uvedale, 19 of the latter were elementary school students. And now the Supreme Court wishes to lessen the effectiveness of gun control across the entire country. They are ENABLING the next massacre!"

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "The United States has been leading towards populism for decades. Much longer than people think. Most people track the rise of populism to the 2008 financial crisis and they are correct, but things were falling apart before that. The 2000s had Bush and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan from the 9/11 attacks. The 1990s had the repeal of many elements of the new deal and a growing neoliberal consensus. The 1980s formally started the mess with a slow breaking apart of the social contract. These problems have been lingering for a long time. But timing is important.\n\nBarack Obama inherited the mess and was given an electoral mandate to do something. Ultimately he failed. Some measures like Dodd-Frank were meant to curb Wall Street. Some success with healthcare and the Affordable Care Act. It wasn't enough to address the growing problems in the US. Obama himself was a mediocre man asked to do extraordinary things and he failed. In response was the right. A reactionary response spurred on by the Tea Party movement and electoral success in 2010 and throughout the Obama administration. Occupy Wall Street on the left was happening as well, but a Democrat was on top and people blame who is charge.\n\nBy 2016, people were angry. Very angry. The national scene was about to get a dose of populism. On the left, eight years of Obama had spurred some on the left for a change. Enter Bernie Sanders. But two problems existed. One was weariness of another Democrat in the oval office and name recognition. Hillary Clinton was a national political figure and facing her was always going to be an uphill battle. Bernie got close, but left wing populism didn't get to the promised land in 2016.\n\nOn the Republican side, things were different. People were pissed of eight years of Obama and the one that carried the populist mantle also had the name recognition. Donald Trump. He blew through the competition and got the nomination. Winning the general election was another story, but ultimately right wing populism was popular enough to win the electoral college.\n\nIn 2020, things were different yet the same. Donald Trump was historically unpopular and the Democratic field technically should have been wide open. When Joe Biden entered things changed. Name recognition is very important in politics and unless that person does something truly terrible it helps in elections. Biden had a lot of flaws as a candidate and he almost lost to Bernie Sanders with Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Granted, the party establishment helped Biden cross the finish line, but name recognition was the biggest factor. Biden was the favorite to win the nomination and he did. Left wing populism couldn't reach the promised land in 2020. Defeating Trump on the other hand should have been a cakewalk, but the electoral college made the race closer than expected. Populism, even with a terrible leader fought back.\n\nPopulism is continuing in 2022. Biden and the Democrats are in control and the energy is on the populist right again. Progressives have some electoral success in 2022 so far (Greg Casar and Summer Lee) but it's clearly going to be the weakest year compared to 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe story goes on and on. Economic catastrophe has dominated the 21st century and the right has had more opportunities to tap into peoples anger."

        "description": "Now that redistricting is officially over, I feel comfortable making a prediction for the House elections. First thing is the Republicans will take the House. The areas of disagreement with math nerds like myself is by how much. My personal politics is pretty left wing, but I'd like to think when it comes to raw numbers I can leave my biases at the door. In my view because of failures of the Biden administration to address the growing inequality and economic pain of Americans, the Democratic Party will lose a lot of seats in the House.\n\nDifferent sources have different opinions. Red Eagle Politics which offers a right wing analysis has the numbers at 184-251. I think those numbers are a little high, but not by a lot. Cook Report which is offers a more politically neutral analysis of elections has the GOP seat gain between 20-35. I think this is pretty accurate, but personally I'm more pessimistic. The Election Center which has more progressive politics thinks the seat addition will be similar to 2020 at about roughly 14 or in that area. I disagree. I think the national environment is very angry and whoever is the President tends to get blamed.\n\nI ran the numbers through [270towin.com](https://270towin.com) that gives me a visual aid to the House elections and came to 189-246. I'm presently going with a 33 seat gain for the Republicans. Fascinating is that there is one pickup for the Democrats in Illinois 13th which is an open seat made by the aggressive Democratic gerrymander in the state. It is a competitive seat however I think it will be the only pickup for the Democrats in the House in 2022.\n\nThat's my analysis. I was thinking of painstakingly writing down every competitive seat and my opinion, but that would take forever. Maybe another time. Tell me what you think the results will be in the 2022 House of Representatives elections?"

        "description": "The Libertarian Party has been around since 1971 and started as a response to the dominant New Deal narrative at the time, but has always been a far third place party in American politics. What's different is that in the Trump era and now, the party has been growing a lot. The party has about 700,000 members roughly in 2021 even recently won a seat in the Wyoming Legislature. The significance is that while national politics certainly closes out third parties, it's also true on the state level. As of March of 2022, the Libertarian Party holds 352 elected offices. Obviously these are mostly local, but it matters. \n\nWhat makes things interesting as oppose to the past is that the Libertarian Party is running a lot of candidates and I mean a lot. The Libertarian Party is running candidates in 54/435 House seats and 17/35 of the Senate seats up. That might not seem like a lot, but it's far more than any other third party. It tells me the party has to have resources to run elections in that many seats and considering how strapped third parties can be for financing it is impressive. Obviously, I don't expect any these candidates to win on the national level, but a good outing could bring in the dollars next cycle. \n\nThis looks like the most organized third party operation I've seen in the United States in my generation at least."

Congress will likely be completely controlled by the GOP and gridlock will go on. Biden might even step down since he would be well into his 80s if he finished out his term. Both options are bleak, but I don't see a lot of chatter if Biden holds on. It could happen."

        "description": "People are talking and some honestly in good faith how to lower this proliferation of guns and mass shootings in the US. I think some people are genuine, however the system as it stands makes any national solution impossible. I'll explain.\n\nThe United States has a very rigid democracy and it serves a minority of people. There is a lie that elections are determined every second November. That's not true. Elections are decided in the primaries. About 10% of the actual population votes in these things and they are the most politically engaged. 90% of House seats are safe and about 85% of Senate seats per cycle. Most of the action happens in the primaries where the only threat to an incumbents power is a challenge from the left in the Democratic Party and from the right in the Republican Party. This dynamic means that Republicans are incentivized to pander to the base of the their party. These people are the most passionately pro-gun and want as little regulation on guns as humanly possible. This also includes interest groups like the gun lobby that spend a lot money on political campaigns. The GOP has every reason to avoid the gun issue and no reason to address it. \n\nIn congress that makes gun legislation impossible. Legislation needs to pass the House and get 60/100 votes in the Senate. Based on these incentive structures. That isn't happening. \n\nAn addition is that for many especially poor/working class white men, the gun is the last vestige of power in their life. The economy is in shambles and demographics are making their voice less important. This resentment makes it impossible to govern since they have an outsized influence on the Republican Party. \n\nUnless politics changes where narrow interest groups and only the most passionate voters effect politics, than the gun issue will stay. No speech. No emotional appeal. The blood of children won't stop a system like this."

These limits do affect hiring and people do move to where the jobs are.

        "description": "The United States has been floating around especially over the last few years as leaning towards authoritarianism. Those fears are understandable and anyone that says the US is impervious to populist trends is being na\u00efve. However the United States has very peculiar instruments that make it difficult to establish an authoritarian leader. The United States is split into three branches of government: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary. Often times these groups are at odds on all sorts of things. A president needs congress to pass bills since they have the power of the purse and even through executive order, the courts can strike down bills. The United States has two major political parties that have dominated politics since the mid 1850s. There have been instances of one party rule, however largely the US has had this 50/50 split in the country that makes an authoritarian power grab difficult. The United States in its name has 50 unique states with different interests that often collide with the federal government. These governors are often independent and will buck not only the opposing party, but their own party. This makes it difficult for an autocrat to rule on the state and local level. These factors are the separation of powers that are in the US constitution. The founders were paranoid of the executive overreach and lack of accountability of monarchs at the time, so created this complicated system as a sort of dictator booby trap. In my mind its been an overreach to getting bills passed, but at its best it makes it difficult for an autocrat to establish power."

Now we have a clear distinction on the court Alito specifically wrote this decision **only** relates to abortion.  But justice Thomas writes that virtually nothing which is not black letter constitution is simply not a right to be protected.\n\nSo we need to focus most specifically on the principle of privacy being a right before we discuss anything else.  Without privacy it simply invites the government to stick its ugly nose into all of our intensely personal matters everywhere. \n\nAND does black letter constitution limit what rights we have?  Are there no inalienable rights outside of our written constitution?  If this is going to be our standard going forward what other rights can we claim without facing the harsh judgement of those originalists who insist on \"words on paper.\"\n\nIf we can restore the principle of \"right to privacy\", then all those other rights can come flooding back and more."

        "description": "Some of you younger people might have forgotten the 2012 Senate elections. During that time a decade ago during the rise of the Tea Party movement, Mitch McConnell was trying to navigate a party that wouldn't stop nominating crazy people. Obviously races like Scott Brown from Massachusetts were always doomed. Elizabeth Warren was going to win that seat and that special election in 2010 was really raw luck. In states like Missouri however, things were different. Incumbent Claire McCaskill was an easy pickup for the GOP, but the primary voters decided to go with Todd Akin after making controversial rape comments lost by 15 points. The Tea party successfully ousted Indiana incumbent Richard Lugar against Richard Mourdock only to lose to Democrat Joe Donnelly by 6 points. Other pickups were lost that year. Jon Tester survived in Montana defeating Denny Rehberg by 2 points. A young Josh Mandel lost to Sherrod Brown in Ohio by 6 points. Not all of those candidates were crazy. But in the cases of Akin, Mourdock and Mandel. The crazier the candidate, the steeper the loss. \n\nFast forward to 2022 and similar problems are happening. Dr. Oz is losing in the polls to John Fetterman in Pennsylvania. Herschel Walker with his problematic past is creating a very close race with Rafael Warnock in Georgia. Eric Greitens in Missouri has had domestic violence problems and just ran an ad that looked like he was going to murder his political opponents. Blake Masters is the favorite in the Republican Primary in Arizona and is backed by billionaire Peter Theil, but Masters political views look too fringe for a swing state like Arizona. It's making the race against incumbent Mark Kelly far more competitive. In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt does have the name recognition from his father, but association with Trump is rather risky considering how swingy Nevada is. In Wisconsin, Republican incumbent Ron Johnson just got exposed in the January 6th hearings in the whole fake electors debacle making this race more competitive.\n\nOverall, this environment makes Mitch McConnell's job more difficult. The Republicans are going to take the House. That is likely. The Senate should be leaning towards the GOP, but these races are making things far more competitive than they should be in a red wave year."

Some SCOTUS members have two circuit courts to supervise requiring them to spend a lot of time overlooking them.\n\nBy expanding SCOTUS membership so there is a one-to-one correspondence would be a valuable thing to do. But it would mean having 15 SCOTUS judges not 9. Now there is no specific number for SCOTUS membership in the constitution and it has varied in the 240 years of our country. So there is no good reason for rejecting such an expansion.  It would ease their workload.\n\nSecondarily the 9th circuit covers such a huge area, it too can be broken up into at least 2 different circuit courts making it possible for a 17 member supreme court.  \n\nThese reasons for expanding SCOTUS have nothing to do with the recent decisions given out, but rather are internal justifications for expansion."

I'm just curious and trying to find some clarification without reading several evenings worth of wiki articles.\n\nSo my question is: How does democracy work in the us? Is there no way for a president to overrule a decision by the supreme court? and if that is the case, how is it a democracy if they basically make the laws without the peoples input? The laws are a big part of a democracy imo. Who decides who is to be a supreme judge? I assume it's not the president, as then it would change every 4 years.\n\nAnyone who can give a quick run down, I'd appreciate it.\n\nThanks!"

        "num_comments": 2,
        "description": "I'll start with this. Roe v. Wade was a controversial ruling. Not that it enshrined rights on a national scale, but that 30% of the population was vehemently against it. These 30% largely vote Republican and for many they are single issue voters. Specifically the evangelical right. For almost half a century this issue alone galvanized religious conservatives to the polls in mass numbers. Now this group is not all or even half of the Republican party. They are at most a third, but they are very engaged. The Republican Party needs this group to turnout to win elections nationally.\n\nA transition happened starting in the 1960s that forever changed politics. The FDR coalition was broad and covered liberal places like New York and California to the conservative south. Most of this coalition was based on left wing economics: government intervention, social programs, etc. The addition of the civil and voting rights acts in the 1960s fractured this coalition. Conservative southern Democrats switched to Dixiecrats and then Republicans. This forever changed American politics as segregation was the biggest social issue of the day. In 1973, when Roe v. Wade was decided, the conservative base became more galvanized. For them this was the bridge too far. Enshrining the right to an abortion on a national level; for 30% of the population that was against it was a recipe for conflict.\n\nSavvy politicians took advantage of this new found political engagement from the religious right which led to the Reagan revolution. Now this turn wasn't solely on social issues and it would be narrow minded to say that, however it terms of raw political passion. For the religious right this issue made them vote. It was life or death for them.\n\nIn 2022, this coalition is effectively over. Friday June 24th, 2022 ended it. There is a proposal to have an abortion ban on the federal level when Republicans take over, but it polls at 13%. In a latest poll, 50% of Democrats say they are more engaged to vote because of this decision. The question becomes: What do the religious right have to fight about now? There is no longer some all powerful court mandating abortion in their state. The wind has been taken out of their sails. You could make the argument for same sex marriage maybe being a galvanizing social issue, but that is a stretch and even so it would only anger more left wing voters more.\n\nThe narrative is that the Supreme Court has rescinded a right that the majority of Americans support. Who is galvanized now?"

        "description": "I'm going to get blowback for this and I understand why. The evidence clearly shows that Donald Trump was irresponsible prior and on January 6th. He clearly is an abrasive asshole. The problem is that the conspiracy charge so far has not been laid out. There is plenty of circumstantial evidence and individual acts he did were clearly wrong. In my opinion the call with Brad Raffensperger being the obvious example. I'm genuinely curious if the Georgia investigation gets him on this. But how do you prosecute a man with the attention span of a gerbil? There always seems to be plausible deniability. \n\nThe problem is that the committee HAD to get everything right. The latest hearing with Cassidy Hutchinson is very damning, but some details are disputed. Now at this point it doesn't really matter that those details aren't central to the overall case. Any legitimate pushback against the committee hurts the committee. The idea was that the January 6th committee wasn't making a political case, but a legal case. In their prosecution of Donald Trump, on Tuesday they made two errors I'm aware of. The disputed tussle in the suburban with secret service and the note that Herschmann said he actually wrote. Now in the grand scheme of things these details aren't relevant to the broad issue. The problem is that the committee is clearly trying to make a legal case and that standard requires ZERO mistakes. The January 6th committee it seems jumped the gun and rushed Hutchinson to the stand to get this testimony. It was explosive, but at what cost? They would have been better served being methodical. Up through the first five hearings they had him, but they got too excited. Now the issue of Donald Trump is a political issue and that is left to the ballot. God help us."

        "num_comments": 2,
        "description": "Hi :) Can somebody (calmly) explain to me why the Texas Heartbeat Act is a morally wrong idea?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly let me clarify. I am an atheist so I am not driven by Christian dogma. I think in the case of rape, medical emergency, and maybe severe disability of the potential child (or whatever you want to call them) abortion can be the lesser evil. So I do not think those should be banned. However there has to be a limit after which abortion becomes infanticide. I assume most of you would agree that, unless there is a medical emergency, taking what is a fully fledged baby and is weeks off being born and aborting it would be wrong, right? Now I look at a fetus and even later-stages of embryo and I see a head, arms, legs, all discernible features of a baby ([https://www.earlylife.co.uk/blogs/news/what-will-i-see-at-an-early-pregnancy-scan-1](https://www.earlylife.co.uk/blogs/news/what-will-i-see-at-an-early-pregnancy-scan-1)). Also they develop a heartbeat around 7.5-8 weeks after pregnancy apparently, which seems to roughly correlate with approaching that appearance of looking like a tiny human being. At some point do we not have to concede that *this thing* is not a sack of cells anymore, but a tiny human? And so it seems to me that around the 6-10 weeks mark is a good point to draw the line in the land, after which only medical emergency or possibly severe disability (imagine 5 years of life heavily disabled then death) of the potential child is acceptable. This is where I would draw the line in the sand. I would *not* require rape-victims to prove they have been raped as the police are already terrible enough with their treatment of women who have been raped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere should the line in the sand be drawn and why?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not believe anybody wholly believes in 'my body, my choice' else that would permit abortion right up until pregnancy. So at what point is it *not just your body* and also the carrier of another body, that of the potential child?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs 6-10 weeks sufficient to allow a rape-victim or accidentally pregnant person to use the morning-after pill or get an abortion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd one thing I want to make very clear is: abortion is not contraception. Condoms, birth control pills, vasectomy, time of month, alternative means of sex. Many ways of having sex without getting pregnant. I believe the word is 'responsibility' here and 'carefulness'. This is a good idea anyway because if you're a man you get struck down with alimony for 18 years if the condom splits  (I know a young lad in this situation) or the woman you have sex with lies about being on the pill (I know someone else in this situation--yes, he should have used a condom)... Now the responsibility will go both ways. Both parties should do their best to ensure their sex will be child-free if that is what they want. Abortion should not be done lightly. It is a sad or unpleasant thing even if in some cases it should be legal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully I haven't missed anything out here, but it is a complicated topic so I probably have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am open to clarifications/criticisms provided they are polite. I am not interested in keyboard wars with anybody :)"

All I've been seeing recently is the left blaming the right for not passing a bill that would have solved some issue and vice versa, when the bill had very little to do with what it was titled and had 1000+ pages? \n\nIE the Build Back Better bill that ended up being a shell of what it originally was and surprising to nobody it wasn't passed.\n\nMake these things illegal. How? Not quite sure how we will do it, maybe a maximum amount of pages or so many changes to be made that have to explicitly pertain to the title of the bill?\n\nThen when these bills are debated we can truly see what they will do and then see who shoots it down and why."

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "I was going over some statistics that interested me because I was struck by how long Joe Biden has been in politics and how little Donald Trump has. It seemed like such a stark contrast and looking over the data, both of these men stand out.\n\nI'll start in the modern era since going over every presidents would be painstaking. This is a hobby, not a university assignment. Ronald Reagan had 16 years of public office behind him. He spent 8 years as Governor of California and 8 years as President of the United States. An interesting resume showing that Reagan was always the man on top, never a subordinate. I didn't count his time in the Screen Actors Guild because that technically isn't politics. George H. W. Bush had the most eclectic and sort of jack of all trades resume. George H. W. Bush had 21 years of public office behind him. He was a congressman for Texas 7th district for two terms. He held a number of short term offices with Ambassador to the United Nations, Chair of the RNC, 2nd Chief of the US Liason Office to the People's Republic of China and CIA Director. He was Vice President for 8 years and President for 4. No modern president has as diverse of a resume as the elder Bush. Bill Clinton had 22 years of public office behind him. He was Attorney General and then Governor of Arkansas and later President of the United States. George W. Bush had 14 years of public office behind him. He was Governor of Texas for 6 years and President of the United States for 8. Barack Obama breaks a trend in that a Senator hadn't been a president since Richard Nixon. Barack Obama had 20 years of public office behind him. 8 years as a State Senator in Illinois, 4 years as the Senator from Illinois and 8 years as President of the United States.\n\nThese patterns are different yet relatively stable. There is a long history of governors becoming presidents and the modern era has this as well. Their times in office are quite similar ranging from 14-22 years. Not outside the norm. Joe Biden and Donald Trump change that. Donald Trump never held public office other than his 4 years as President. In contrast Joe Biden was a US Senator from Delaware for 36 years, Vice President for 8 and President for at least 4. That total adds up to an astonishing 48 years in public office. These two figures represent extremes that neither will probably be matched in my lifetime. Someone with as little political experience or as much."

        "description": "Edit: Clarifacation\n\nI'm worried that a genocide is in the works in America thanks to Christian Fundamentalist Fascism taking hold in america. I live in a Chrisitan Fundamentalist town and that's how most of my family is, so I'm seeing it happen around me.\n\n[Here are the 10 warning signs of a Genocide via Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factors_for_genocide)\n\nThe 10 stages are:\n\nClassification -> \"Us vs Them\"\n\nSymbolization -> using insulting symbols like \"Demon\" to describe the target group \n\nDiscrimination\n\nDehumanization\n\nOrganization -> the creation of a group ready and willing to carry out the genocide \n\nPolarization -> turning the masses against the target group with propaganda\n\nPreparation -> creation of a plan\n\nPersecution -> forced displacement of target group, labor camps\n\nExtermination \n\nDenial -> \"Target group is subhuman, we have done nothing wrong\"\n\n\nMy concern stems from the fact that there are multiple groups that clear 5 or more of these stages. Actually.... it's the usual suspects. The same ones targeted in the Holocaust...\n\nThe first group I'll mention is immigrants, especially Latin-American immigrants. The right has been particularly hard and inhumane to immigrants and we all know this. In fact, I'd say this group is the furthest along in stages, up to stage 8. We all know how Trump used propaganda to achieve that. Many immigrants are already in awful camps at the border.\n\nThe next group is LGBT people. The right is going after them really hard. Gay people clear stage 5, arguably 6. Trans people definitely clear stage 6. The NIFB has been going to city council meetings and declaring openly that lgbt people should recieve capital punishment-- that is, the death penalty. The ADF has been campaigning for America to become a theocracy for ages and one of their agendas has been the criminalization of homosexuality. As for Trans people, we have anti trans documentaries coming out now that are just propaganda pieces designed to demonize the demographic. They completely ignore the science. Lastly, the right has spent the last decade painting LGBT people as groomers, pedos, predatory, ect in order to fear monger against them. All of the stages up to preparation have been cleared. \n\nThen there's non-Christian religions, especially Jewish and Islamic people. That particular group of people have faced all kinds of propaganda levied at them since 9/11, but now it's getting bad. I live in a Christian fundamentalist family and they're starting to get very antisemitic.\n\nThe most worrisome part is the erosion of separation of church and state. The erosion happening is in favor of Chrisitan Fundamentalism. Other religions and walks of life that don't line up with that ideology are at risk.\n\nLastly, I want to point out this article from 2007. It's about the rise of Christian Facism in America and it compares it with the rise of the 3rd Reich via a survivor of WWII. \nhttps://www.popmatters.com/christian-fascism-american-democracy-hedges"

Over the past decade or so, I've watched the political divide grow deeper and deeper (and yes, I know it's exacerbated by the media, but it's still a thing). \n\nI've thought a lot about what could change to reverse the direction, and the closest I've come is an imaginary situation where prominent moderate Republicans and Democrats agree to form some sort of bipartisan administration, with representatives from each party in senior positions.\n\nI hadn't envisioned a third party forming. But this, IMO, has even more potential.\n\nWhat makes this exciting to me is that it's not a bunch of no-name independents. It sounds like this party is launching with some people who have names and credibility in both parties.\n\nLiving in a country with 3 major parties, as Canada has, can make government messy. Our system is different anyway, based on the British Parliamentary structure. We frequently have minority governments, where parties have to work together to get stuff done. I'm not sure how the 3-party system will play out in the US.\n\nI'm pretty confident, though, that if this party gains some ground, having a third (centrist) option will be attractive to a lot of people, which in turn should force the other two parties to moderate, to hold on to their own members.\n\nI'm hopeful and happy about this, and I'm really interested to hear what Americans think about the development."

        "description": "Democrats  argue that the EC needs to go because, if it were abolished, they would  win nearly every presidential election. To support this, they point to  the cast-iron objective fact that Democrats have indeed won the popular  vote for every election since 1990 *except* for 2004. Conservatives certainly cannot refute that fact; it is simply a fact and there's no two ways about it.\n\nOne  could further argue (although this much isn't a cast-iron objective  fact and is certainly up for debate) that the EC still indirectly caused  Republicans to win the 2004 election. After all, that was the first  election after 9/11, so Bush's \"America Fuck Yeah\" attitude against  terrorism was, at that specific point in time, just what the American  people needed. If that \"guns blazing\" attitude had been attempted at any  other point in American history (with maybe the exception of Pearl  Harbor, but FDR was still going to get re-elected anyway), it would have  backfired horribly.\n\nBut Bush was  only able to do that because he won the 2000 election ... an election he  only won because of the EC. If the popular vote were what counted, Bush  never would have gotten the chance to \"prove himself\" in the post-9/11  aftermath. In an alternate universe, where Gore won the 2000 election,  and in 2004, a new Republican candidate was going up against incumbent  Gore, Gore likely would have won due to it being HIM getting all the  credit for the post-9/11 response, just like how Democrat incumbent FDR got all the credit for his post-Pearl Harbor response.\n\nSo  while it isn't as much of a cast-iron objective fact as the democrats  winning the popular vote in every other election from 1990-onwards, the  case can still be made for the EC being to blame.\n\nBy  contrast, do conservatives have a good reason why the EC should stick  around? Is it truly just because the EC is the only way Republicans can  win presidential elections, and they know it? Or do conservatives  actually have a legitimate, good, and objective reason to justify the  electoral college in the 21st century?"

First, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m posting this in the right place so please let me know if otherwise. \nSo my coworker just showed me an audio clip of a congress woman that was talking about abortion. She was saying things such as why not abort full grown children up to 18 if they\u2019re not productive to society. It\u2019s sounds so extreme and I haven\u2019t been able to find anything about it anywhere. I\u2019m hoping the clip was taken out of context so do any of you all know what the clip might be from? I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have my more details and thanks I\u2019m advance!"

        "num_comments": 3,
        "description": "I've seen/heard people deny that Christian Nationalism is a real thing. It's real, and they already have the Supreme Court. This kind of fanaticism can really only end in a handful of ways, and some of those ways are very, *very* dangerous to those of us who value freedom.\n\n> Last night Rachel Maddow dedicated most of her show to attacking Christian Nationalism, Gab, Doug Mastriano, and my character personally. I\u2019d like to start by saying that I\u2019m praying for Ms. Maddow. She\u2019s obviously a very confused and sad woman, but Jesus loves her nonetheless. I watched a replay of her show and reacted to many of the baseless lies in this video on Gab TV, I encourage you to please watch it to hear our side of the story and full response.\n> \n> I don\u2019t apologize for anything that I\u2019ve said or any of the work we are doing to take dominion of our country and culture for the glory of God. Jesus gave us a mission: the Great Commission. We are to make disciples of all nations, including but not limited to the United States of America.\n> \n> We have seen the fruits\u2013or lack thereof\u2013of our nation being led by Godless pagans, nonbelievers, Jews, and fake Christians-in-name-only. Now it is time for our nation to be led by wise Christian warriors who fear God, read their Bible, and will not bend the knee to the wicked Establishment class.\n> \n> In other words: we need Christian men who embrace their God-given masculine energy to conquer and lead. Currently we have weak and pathetic emasculated \u201cChristian\u201d men (like Mike Pence) who embrace submissive feminine energy. That ends now.\n> \n> If we are going to build a Christian movement it must be exclusively Christian and we can\u2019t be afraid to say that out loud. We are all sinners saved by Grace, but if you do not repent and believe in Jesus Christ then you do not share our Biblical worldview and cannot participate in any meaningful position of authority in the movement. It\u2019s just that simple.\n> \n> Political, social, and cultural movements without a shared common worldview and moral framework are doomed to failure. This can only work with a baseline barrier to entry and that baseline is simple: you must repent and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. We don\u2019t care about your race, ethnic background, or past sins because neither does Jesus. We only care that you wholeheartedly repent and follow Him.\n> \n> Christian Nationalism is not merely a political movement. It\u2019s a social, cultural, and spiritual one. Christian Nationalism is not merely limited to the right wing in the United States. Our King has dominion over this entire earth. Every square inch. Christians around the world are rising up right at this very moment to claim what is rightfully His.\n> \n> We are done being the footstool of the Enemy. We are done being pushovers. We are done with simply wanting to be left alone. Now we want to win. Win souls for Christ. Win elections. Win in the culture. Win in the education system. Win with our own technology. Our own media. Our own entertainment. Win for the glory of God.\n> \n> God does not discriminate. The only \u201cChosen People\u201d are those who have chosen to follow Jesus Christ. Christianity is not a religion of racial supremacy where the race or ethnic group you are born into elevates you above the rest of us \u201ccattle.\u201d That\u2019s not the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. John 3:15 says that whosoever believeth in him will not perish, but will have everlasting life. Galatians 3:28 says there is neither Jew nor Greek, we are all one in Jesus Christ.\n> \n> Anyone is welcome to join us if they repent and accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.\n> \n> Including Rachel Maddow.\n> \n> To God be the glory,\n> \n> Andrew Torba\n> CEO, Gab.com\n> Jesus Christ is King of Kings"

Lindsey Graham challenges 2020 Georgia election probe subpoena](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/sen-lindsey-graham-challenges-2020-georgia-election-probe-subpoena)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 As expected, U.S. Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham\u00a0is challenging a subpoena to testify before\u00a0a special grand jury that\u2019s investigating\u00a0whether then-President Donald Trump and others broke any laws when they [**tried to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s win**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/legal-battles-over-past-and-future-elections-heat-up-in-georgia-and-arizona) in Georgia.\n\nGraham, a Republican from South Carolina, received a subpoena that was issued on July 26 and orders him to appear before the special grand jury to testify on Aug. 23, his lawyers said in a court filing. Graham is seeking to have the challenge to the subpoena heard in federal court in Atlanta rather than before the Fulton County Superior Court judge who\u2019s overseeing the\u00a0special grand jury.\n\nThe senator is one of the Trump allies who Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\u00a0wants to question\u00a0as part of her investigation into what she alleges was \u201ca multi-state, coordinated plan by the Trump Campaign to influence the [**results of the November 2020 election**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/idaho-republicans-considers-resolution-to-reject-2020-election-results) in Georgia and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nGraham had said repeatedly that he would fight the subpoena once he received it, which happened last week, according to his lawyers. He has\u00a0denied meddling in Georgia\u2019s election.\n\nIn a court filing last month, Willis, a Democrat, wrote that Graham made at least two telephone calls to Georgia Secretary of State\u00a0Brad Raffensperger\u00a0and members of his staff in the weeks after Trump\u2019s loss to Biden, asking about reexamining certain absentee ballots \u201cto explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nMore at the FREE link at the top of this topic.....\n\n*Looks link the hypocrite, Lindsey Graham wants to conceal his responsibility in the trump fraud/lie....*"

        "description": "People have wondered why the United States is a two party system and ultimately its been baked into the system since its founding. The electoral college determines the presidency. These slate of electors are determined by the states and are added up at the end. A majority is required to elect a president, in modern times that would be 270 electoral votes or over out of 538. This creates a necessity to fuse all political power into two parties to gain the majority necessary to win the presidency. Otherwise the president would be determined by the House of Representatives and the vice-president by the senate and that hasn't happened since 1824. Americans generally actually want to elect their own president.\n\nThis top down approach goes to the national level with the House and Senate seats. It goes down to the state level with Governors and state legislatures. It's least impacted at the local level with non-partisan races, but big cities still use the two major parties.\n\nAll in all, if Americans want a multi party system, then the electoral college and the majority rule have to go."

I believe there's other related legislation too.\n\nA lot of anti-gun control types believe that guns keep people safe, so they don't want them removed completely.\n\nI don't recall the second amendment mentioning the types or quantity of guns that people have though.\n\nCould you not have a situation where e.g. each household is limited to one basic pistol and a finite amount of ammo each year?\n\nSo, nothing advanced. No unlimited bullets. You'd still be complying with the second amendment and wouldn't be taking away all guns.\n\nSurely a basic pistol is the absolute most you would need in emergencies where you need to protect yourself??\n\nYou could go further by having proper background checks and psychological assessments.\n\nSurely this would vastly reduce the amount of mass shootings and deaths from gun violence in the US."

        "description": "The facts are staggering. The vast majority of presidential candidates of both major parties fall on this trajectory. They were vice president, senator or governor prior. Granted, not all those candidates were darlings of the establishment, but were familiar in government circles. Donald Trump never held public office before becoming president and unlike Wendell Wilkie actually became president. Putting these facts together, it's even more shocking what happened in 2016. A once in a century moment.\n\nEdit: Yes Dwight Eisenhower never held public office before becoming President, but he was a war hero after the Second World War so I kind of make that an exception. "

        "description": "The recent news of many of the members of the House of Representatives either losing their primaries or retiring because of their vote to impeach Donald Trump has some people concerned. Ten Republicans voted to impeach Trump in the House. Four chose to retire, four lost their primaries and two won partially because of the unique jungle primary system in Washington and California. On the surface, this would be a cause for worry however the system is doing what the founders intended. The House of Representatives is suppose to show the passions of the moment and popular will. At this present moment in the Republican Party that is all Donald Trump. \n\nCompare that to the Senate where seven voted to Impeach Donald Trump. One is up in 2022. One is up in 2024. Three are up in 2026. Two have chosen to retire. Granted, the original intention of the founders for the Senate was an unelected body, but the spreading out of Senate elections makes the body less responsive to immediate political whims. Donald Trump doesn't have the same control over the United States Senate. \n\nThis system was designed to be anti-monarchy. The founders wanted a system polar opposite to monarchy of Britain. A system of checks and balances. The separation of powers. The greatest praise of this system is the many anti-dictator booby traps that make it difficult for one person to rule. \n\nThe criticism of the system is that change is slow. Parties have to agree on a consensus for anything to get through. Many of the pressing matters of the day require a more efficient government. But the founders put efficiency second to the fear of tyrannical rule.\n\nWhether or not that system is relevant to the 21st century is a whole other matter, but one thing is for sure. It has definitely slowed down Donald Trump."

        "title": "AB 2236 California Assembly Bill - Allowing Optometrists to Perform Eye Procedures",
        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "Link to a reference to the bill: [https://fastdemocracy.com/bill-search/ca/20212022/bills/CAB00024692/](https://fastdemocracy.com/bill-search/ca/20212022/bills/CAB00024692/)\n\nSorry I know this is a bit of a fringe political issue, but basically wanted to get the site's opinion on it. I'm submitting to US politics instead of any medicine or optometry related subreddits intentionally so I can get a more neutral opinion. \n\nAs I understand it, the bill being suggested would expand optometrist's scope of practice to include laser surgeries, lid surgeries, and prescribe medications like Mestinon (for myasthenia gravis) in the state of California. These are currently only allowed to be done by ophthalmologists. I admit I'm training to be one so I have a dog in this fight but I'll try to be objective and informative in layman's terms. Keep in mind similar laws have passed or been blocked in other states already so it's kind of a nationwide issue.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pros:** \n\nCan increase access to care. Most ophthalmology practices are pretty busy and have trouble fitting in new patients so theoretically it would be helpful to have more providers in this space. A lot of optometrists already do screening exams and such in their practices, and some even prescribe drops and manage mild glaucoma and mild traumas. It's pretty helpful as a surprising amount of serious eye problems go unnoticed until pretty late, but most \n\nGlasses retail is also suffering so it helps optometrists provide other useful services that can keep them in business instead of resorting to other things. \n\nThe procedures that are being discussed are not technically the most difficult or invasive in my opinion - most of them turn out pretty good if you know what you're doing. Disclaimer: I'll include my impressions of these procedures below and I'm saying this relative to the way more complex surgeries I have to learn in my training - and even simple things can get complicated once you start trying to alter human anatomy. \n\nArguably this might work if optometrists are performing these procedures under indirect supervision of an ophthalmologist - it would help to have someone around to bail you out of a sticky situation and functionally that's the same as I feel right now in training. Similarly, other surgical specialties have been resorting to recruiting nurse-practitioners and physician's assistants to hammer out a lot of their simpler procedures. \n\nIf anyone's an optometrist please provide your POV on the pros- I'm probably not the best for this as you can see. \n\n**Cons:** \n\nThe bill doesn't really have a great standard for training. I think a 1 day certification course is considered adequate in some cases to do these procedures, which seems a little brash. That doesn't even include the clinical training on who's a good surgical candidate, etc. Also these procedures would be regulated by the California State Board of Optometry who do not have any experience doing these procedures, which is pretty nonsensical. Even if these procedures are simple, a lot of them can be blinding if things go wrong - see below. \n\nComplications can be pretty bad even for these simple procedures. Access to care may get even worse if ophthalmologists get flooded with complications from these procedures. Having to do an implant exchange for a botched YAG for example can be pretty tough for most surgeons if the surgery was a while ago for example - there is a precedent for this happening in Texas. \n\nThe insurance is gonna be a nightmare. You're asking to get sued if something bad happens. The insurance companies for ophthalmologists require you to be board certified or board eligible at minimum - which includes 8 years of post undergrad schooling and training. You could be ruined as an optometrist if you take a risk on these procedures. \n\nI think it will ruin relationships between optometrists and ophthalmologists. Right now the niches are more well defined but as it gets more blurred we start to have more of these interdisciplinary spats on how patients should best be managed. This is already a problem in medicine as a whole. \n\nThis seems more financially motivated as an \"easy\" way for optometrists to have access to lucrative procedures (cosmetic surgery, botox, lasers). I feel like the ultimate goal is to try and get access to doing refractive surgery but that's a bit of a slippery slope, and I'm throwing stones from a glass house if I'm going to bring up financial motivations in modern medicine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For reference as I know many people may not be fully aware of the difference:**\n\nOphthalmologist - 4 years medical school + 1 year medical/surgical training + 3 years eye clinical and surgical training + 1-2 years of further fellowship training. Advantage of having years of education in general medicine as well as dedicated intensive 3-5 years of surgical training (talking 80+ hour weeks in some programs). Admittedly not that great at prescribing glasses or contacts in most cases. Most tend to specialize in a particular set of procedures (ex. cataracts and small glaucoma surgeries only). \n\nOptometrist - 4 years optometry school + 1 year of optional residency (maybe more?). Primarily trained in refraction and related issues (contact lens fitting) - although in recent years they have been taking more of a primary care role in most states. No dedicated surgical training that I know of. Interestingly there's an ophthalmology resident out there who was a former optometry student and she says it did not help her much in her current training. \n\n*Laser surgery examples:* \n\n\\- YAG laser - done after cataract surgery to remove scar tissue that accumulates behind the lens - complications can include damage to the lens implant and possibly retinal detachment if a lot of energy is used, also contraindicated if complications exist from the initial cataract surgery, so it helps to know how that works. Worst case (besides a retinal detachment) you may need a lens implant exchange which drastically reduces the odds you'll be able to see super well without external correction, and its another surgery which can have its own complications. \n\n\\- SLT laser - punching holes in the drainage system of the eyeball and lowering the pressure - complications can include inducing scarring that can close the drainage system and increase the pressure if overdone or in the wrong context. Possible that the scarring is so bad you need a tube drainage device implanted in your eye. Also damage to the eye from high pressure is permanent when it happens. \n\n\\- LPI - punching a hole in the iris to prevent pressure spikes in patients at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma, or treating someone in an episode of such - complications include inflammation and damaging the cornea, photopsias, double vision if the hole is too big, bleeding which can cause a pressure spike, etc. Worst case you fry the cornea and you end up needing a transplant but also similar things could happen as with SLT. \n\n*Eye procedure examples:*\n\n\\- Corneal crosslinking - to stabilize thinning of a cornea from diseases like keratoconus. You have to scrape the cornea with a blade and then put riboflavin and uv light on the surface. Contraindicated if your cornea is too thin. Complications include corneal ulcers, corneal melt and perforation, corneal failure from cell damage - basically can go completely blind and maybe even lose the eye. \n\n\\- Eyelid biopsies - cut out lesions on the eyelids that might be bothersome or concerning for malignancy. I think the bill is mostly for benign lesions. Complications include recurrence of lesions with inadequate resection, cosmetic problems like scarring, or eyelids that are scarred in a bad position where it can scratch your cornea or prevent your eye from closing - you won't go blind but you'll need another surgery and you'll never look the same. You can accidentally hit the eye while cutting though, which could blind you. \n\n\\- Periocular injections - anesthetic, steroids, botox, fillers for a variety of reasons. Reports have been coming out that some medications can destroy your eye when these get injected into the wrong artery on your face, although it seems like a freak accident to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you guys think or if there are glaring problems with this write up - I know its a long winded. Hopefully some good discussion, if not it was at least therapeutic and helps me organize my thoughts here."

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "A pattern that is emerging is that Donald Trump has an effect on polling and election results. There appears to be this portion of voters that don't respond to pollsters, don't vote in midterms or special elections, but do vote for Donald Trump. In modern politics there is usually this third of the population that is completely absent from politics in anyway. They don't vote. They don't read the news. They're generally apolitical unless something extraordinary happens. Donald Trump was that exception. \n\nThe 2016 polls had Hillary Clinton up against Donald Trump consistently. The margin wasn't massive, but consistent enough for people to believe that yes this was going to be a close election, but that Clinton was likely winning. On the Senate side, the pollsters overestimated the Democrats in races like Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. On the House side, the generic ballot overestimated Democrat support and while yes Republicans did lose seats - it wasn't nearly as many as the polls predicted. \n\nSimilar things happened in 2020. It is true that Joe Biden did defeat Donald Trump, but the margin was a bit less than the polls predicted. Biden ended up winning narrow margins in five key swing states. It was enough to be the clear victor, but hardly a landslide. On the Senate side, the pollsters overestimated the Democrats again in races like Susan Collins in Maine and Thom Tillis in North Carolina. On the House side, the generic ballot overestimated Democratic support again. The margin was enough to keep the House for the Democrats, but not enough to expand or even preserve their gains from 2018. \n\nContrast all this to the 2018 midterms. On the Senate side, the polls got the races pretty accurately. The only exception was Florida that was such a close race that no pollster could accurately predict it. Most had it correctly as a toss up. Indiana was a weird one, but the pollsters correctly had it as a tossup. On the House side, the generic ballot was pretty close. The difference was within the margin of error and as predicted the Democratic Party made big gains that year. \n\nMy prediction is that the 2022 midterms will go along with these trends if they hold - the Democrats will keep the Senate and lose the House. \n\nThere appears clearly some voters that are solely loyal to Donald Trump. They don't support the Republican Party and aren't interested in Republican congressional candidates. Donald Trump's populism has awakened a silent portion of the electorate that are not conventional voters and have upended two presidential elections. However, they appear to only be visitors every four years. 2022 looks to be predictable."

        "description": "&#x200B;\n\n>First, there is the issue of the DOJ\u2019s longstanding policy against taking so-called \u201covert investigative steps\u201d in criminal investigations (e.g., warranted searches and grand jury proceedings) that could have political impact close to an election (typically construed as within 90 days). In addition, it was recently reported that AG Garland signed a memo emphasizing that highly politically sensitive investigations require approval from senior DOJ officials.\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/hold-your-horses-a-trump-indictment-isnt-a-sure-thing](https://www.thedailybeast.com/hold-your-horses-a-trump-indictment-isnt-a-sure-thing)\n\n>Still, the rule is typically straightforward. For example, if prosecutors believe a candidate for office has committed a crime and it is possible to delay charging that person, they should wait until after an election to do so.  \n>  \n>But the complexities of the Trump investigations are testing the limits of that practice. **It is unclear whether the 60-day rule applies to a high-profile political figure who is not a candidate in the coming election.** \\[unclear why NYT says 60 when everyone else says 90\\]  \n>  \n>Normally it would not, but Mr. Trump, who has hinted at another run for the presidency in 2024, is effectively the face of the Republican Party, his image and fate deeply intertwined with those of most congressional candidates in his party who continue to embrace him.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/us/trump-investigations-midterm-elections.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/04/us/trump-investigations-midterm-elections.html)\n\n>The timing \u2014 before Trump announced his candidacy and months out from the midterms \u2014 appears to be in line with the Department of Justice standard of not taking overt investigative steps that could be perceived as politically motivated within 90 days of an election.  \n>  \n>Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor, told CNN the decision to execute the raid on August 8 is likely because midterm elections were coming up in exactly three months \u2014 on November 8.  \n>  \n>\"Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out,\" Konig told CNN. \"That policy, that may be a reason why they did it today because they want to stay clear of that if they're interpreting that as a 90 day rule.\"\n\n[https://www.insider.com/the-fbis-timing-for-the-mar-a-lago-trump-raid-is-likely-based-on-this-90-day-policy-2022-8](https://www.insider.com/the-fbis-timing-for-the-mar-a-lago-trump-raid-is-likely-based-on-this-90-day-policy-2022-8)\n\nDoes this rule apply to Trump? You'd have to ask Merrick Garland but based on what's actually happening it looks like he thinks it does."

        "description": "It seems that people forget American history pretty quickly sometimes. Before the Reagan Revolution, the Democratic Party essentially controlled congress. The division was between the more liberal wing and the Southern Democrats. This idea of the Democratic Party being distinctly a liberal party is a product of the 20th century and after the second world war. Advancements in social rights and the expansion of social safety net increased the Democratic Parties attachment to liberal issues. There was however push back. The Southern Democrats big issue of the day was segregation and there were many of these Senators. This tension eventually created a shift in the political parties with the south gradually becoming more Republican.\n\nMy point is that these areas have always been conservative. It's just the political party representing them has changed. Nowadays everything is much more 50/50 with Democrats clearly being liberal and Republicans clearly being Conservative. The days of the conservative Democrat and the Liberal Republican are disappearing. Longtime West Virginia Democratic Senator Richard Byrd for example was hardly a liberal and was an outright segregationist. Granted some issues like segregation aren't in the spotlight anymore, but any big Democratic majority will have to deal with conservative Democrats. Much like the old days."

        "description": "The average cost of building a new city is typically $100k - $500k per new resident, with extreme highs of $1m.  Let's take the high end of the average for arguments sake of $500k.  \n\n\nWhy don't we build a city specifically for Asylums / Migrants entering the country?  Let's propose building a city that can hold 20,000 people, a decent sized suburb.  You're estimating about $10b in up front costs. That sounds massive, but the United States defense budget for 2022 alone was $753b (2)  This would give a place for a ton of people that could be designed specifically for processing legal citizenship, necessary screenings, immediate emergency medical attention etc.  It would be an opportunity for different business' to expand career opportunities by building businesses there, and helping migrants to get work training while being processed into citizens.  \n\n\nIt's reasonable to assume that US citizens are mostly on board with the idea that the US needs immigration reform and a better process for people to gain citizenship (3).  It's reasonable to assume that US citizens are mostly on board with feeling that border states are shouldering the brunt of migrants and it causes additional strains on their citizens and states.    \n\n\nWe can afford it.  We've got the resources.  It's humane.    \n\n\n  \n\n\n* (1) [https://www.capitalfrontiers.com/single-post/2018/06/10/how-much-would-building-a-new-city-cost#:\\~:text=New%20city%20development%20runs%20as,city's%20population%20grows%20over%20time](https://www.capitalfrontiers.com/single-post/2018/06/10/how-much-would-building-a-new-city-cost#:~:text=New%20city%20development%20runs%20as,city's%20population%20grows%20over%20time).  \n(2) [https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-trillion-dollar-defense-budget/#:\\~:text=This%20is%20%2433%20billion%E2%80%94about,would%20propose%20in%20FY%202023](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-trillion-dollar-defense-budget/#:~:text=This%20is%20%2433%20billion%E2%80%94about,would%20propose%20in%20FY%202023).  \n(3) [https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-72-americans-say-immigrants-come-us-jobs-improve-their-lives-53-say-ability-immigrate](https://www.cato.org/blog/poll-72-americans-say-immigrants-come-us-jobs-improve-their-lives-53-say-ability-immigrate)"

It stands for \u201cwhere we go one, we go all\u201d.  \n>  \n>Media Matters researcher Alex Kaplan tweeted on Saturday that \u201cTrump this summer used the song in a campaign-style video he posted on Rumble and Truth Social\u201d.  \n>  \n>\u201cAs they did when Trump previously used the song, QAnon figures are claiming the use of the song brings some kind of legitimacy for them,\u201d he added.  \n>  \n>One QAnon follower previously said the former president\u2019s use of the song was \u201cTHE mother of all Q proofs\u201d and \u201cthe biggest nod they\u2019ve ever given us,\u201d according to Media Matters.  \n>  \n>Saturday\u2019s Ohio rally also saw Trump supporters raise their fingers to the sky in a bizarre salute, which is also being described as a possible nod to the conspiracy theory.  \n>  \n>The Daily Beast reporter Will Sommer tweeted on Saturday night that **\u201cthis Trump rally finger salute is curious. Some on Twitter are calling it a QAnon salute, with 1 finger for \u2018Where we go ,\u2019** and Trump is playing a pro-Q song as he talks. I\u2019ve never seen this happen before, though, so if it\u2019s a Q thing it\u2019s new\u201d.\n\n [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-supporters-finger-salute-rally-b2169777.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-supporters-finger-salute-rally-b2169777.html)"

Is the \"New Man\" chavismo government developed years ago, basically people from the slums with bad education and a thief culture (malandros) that is really cruel. \n\nThere are theories the venezuelan government is sending criminals to the US as revenge and most of them have orders of staying in New York. In Tik ToK one made a video after arriving to the US saying he is a criminal and that he knows for a fact that behind him trucks fulls of more criminals like him were arriving into the US, he commented that within two years US will be as dangerous and destroyed as Venezuela."

Most if not all of the colonists identified as Englishmen.\n\nMost of the protests were over really minor tax issues designed to repay Britain for protecting the colonials during the recent war with France. It was not unreasonable in the abstract, and while the British parliament did not have any colonial representatives, they could easily determine what was going on there in north America if they chose to find out. \n\nSo, I would ask, were they truly radical choosing to rebel?"

Because the **principle** against abortion would begin at conception not at some future partial development stage.  Clearly the GOP is not willing to stand on principles ever for any reason, any time after conception is a compromise of the principle.\n\nOn the other hand, the viability standard at 24 weeks has at least some reasoning behind it where the infant is well enough developed to survive outside a womb, which is not the case at 15 weeks.\n\nThere is a fraction of voters who prefer unlimited abortion as their right, but they represent only the smallest % of voters.\n\nSo, the 15-week limit on abortion is some politically determined standard not medically based at all, and since it is not based upon some ideal principle but rather a compromise and it is simply not legitimate.\n\nAmerica needs to keep politics out of medicine, it does not belong in the doctor's office."

This storyline is very real and yet not covered well in our own current media until this blog has come out."

For the sake of argument, let's round to 79.\n\nFor example...  Currently, you have to be at least 35 years old to be president.  So 79-35 gives you an upper limit of 44.  You can run for president between the ages of 35-44.  Senators have a lower limit of 30 so that would make them eligible between the ages of 30-49.  Representatives have a lower limit of 25 so that would make them eligible between the ages of 25-54.  For Supreme Court candidates, there is no lower or upper limit.  But I can't imagine a scenario where someone would think a person would be a good judge before they are 18.  So let us say you can be appointed and serve 18-61.\n\nThere are so many issues that exist in US politics today that would be fixed by upper-age guardrails like this.  \n\nFull disclosure, I'm 47... I took care of my aging father as he lost himself in dementia and died of lung cancer at 72.  We take care of my mother who seems to be going down the same road losing her mind and is now 75.  While it is possible to have a brilliant mind in your 80s, it is extremely rare and trusting lifelong politicians in their 60's, 70's and 80's to run our government seems the equivalent of putting a blind man in the driver's seat of the shuttle bus from SLC to Vegas simply because they've driven that route all their life.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease, tell me I'm wrong about this..."

Since he has some indications of support from the world's wealthiest man, Elon Musk, for a possible 2024 election run, this raises an issue around why Musk would cast a vote for someone who supports the false claims.  Does he himself support those false claims?  Or does he not support them, but think that somehow they are not a make-or-break matter in deciding whom to vote for?\n\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/us-election-risk-index/all-election-denier-officials/\nHere Are the 253 Key Political Leaders Who Back Trump\u2019s False Claims of Election Fraud\nSeptember 6, 2022"

And it's not that those polls are necessarily wrong -- they were generally more accurate in 2020 than the mainstream ones -- there are just a lot of them.  That is easy to adjust for....Nate Silver devoted part of a podcast to this topic if you want to know how.\n\nThe key to reading these \"dire\" forecasts is to get motivated by them and ACT.  This election is going to be very, very close.  Democratic volunteers should focus TODAY on GOTV in the Senate races in GA, NV, AZ, NH and PA.  We MUST keep the Senate as it is very likely we are going to lose the House.\n\nStop whining about the polls and GET OUT THE VOTE!\n\nFor a great up-to-the-minute forecast of every single Senate, House and Governor race, read this:\n\n[http://www.borntorunthenumbers.com/2022/11/btrtn-2022-official-midterm-election.html](http://www.borntorunthenumbers.com/2022/11/btrtn-2022-official-midterm-election.html)"

Are there really that many Pennsylvanians voting Shapiro for governor, and Oz for Senate? In other traditionally competitive states, it's the gubernatorial candidates out-polling the Senate candidates. Granted, I live in a now redrawn district that voted for Trump and re-elected its 2018 blue-wave incumbent, but the margins there were much slimmer, so ticket-splitting wasn't a massive anomaly like the polls suggest in PA."

        "description": "I'm aiming this post squarely at all the Republican/GOP election deniers and nutcases who are accusing Democrats of rigging the election while failing to realize their own party gerrymanders, and is responsible for voter intimidation/suppression on both a state and national level. At the MAGA lunatics who want Trump back in 2024 and are threatening poll workers with violence if things don't go their way, and support January 6th and all manner of sick, decrepit extremism. At the idiots who not only have utterly FAILED to learn from history, but have brought shame to true conservatives and moderate Republicans who realized what the Grand Old Party, the Party of Lincoln and Eisenhower, has become after Trump.\n\nBe VERY careful of what you wish for. You might just get it. And you're not going to like the result. It's happened before and I can guarantee you it will happen again. Nazism, Bolshevism, the fall of the Roman Republic, the Khmer Rouge, etc.\n\nYou want fascism and authoritarianism so bad? You want to have a dictator control your life and tell you what to do? You want to sacrifice your rights and freedoms for more security, a better economy, and bread on the table? You want people of other races, genders, orientations, etc to be stripped of their rights or eliminated from society? You want to vote for the end of democracy?\n\nGo ahead. Cast your vote and watch as all your rights and liberties are taken from you one by one, including the right TO vote, and the people who thought would represent you accumulate more power until you wake up one day and America is a one-party dictatorship. **Only then will you realize that freedoms and rights are exceptionally easy to take away from the people but almost impossible to win back. Authoritarians like to stay in power and maintain their control, after all.**\n\nThe Republicans have already made it abundantly clear they will not accept the midterm election results if they are not in their favor, and will simply ignore these votes or attempt to fix the elections to force their way in. Or commit violence against innocents, like they did on January 6th over 2020 election fraud conspiracies. This is not how democracies work. You know where elections are fixed and rigged? In Russia, Hungary, Turkey, and other autocratic nations abroad where the people CANNOT vote for their representatives or are given the illusion that they can vote, only for a single man and his party to remain in power for decades upon decades.\n\n**And you know what happens to many diehard followers of authoritarianism after authoritarians seize power? They are locked up in a cell or simply die. They are imprisoned or killed when the dictator in charge has no more use for them or when he perceives them as a threat to his power. Research the Night of the Long Knives or Stalin's Great Purge for an example. You could be the most loyal sycophant to a dictator, and still meet your end when you've served your purpose as a \"useful idiot\".**\n\n**Look at what happened after January 6th: most of the mobsters who attacked the Capitol under Trump ended up arrested and are now awaiting court trials or are in jail. Trump DID NOT SAVE THEM OR HELP THEM. Do you honestly think the GOP will help you after all that they've done these past few years? That DeSantis or another Trump-like politician will make your life better? They will not help you and will in fact betray you. Because that's what authoritarians do. They have no morals. They only care about themselves and their own power.**\n\n**REMEMBER THAT.**\n\nSo once again, I implore you: be careful what you wish for. You might just get it. And you're not going to like the result. Who you vote for could mean the difference between America hobbling along until the next election cycle or outright tyranny."

        "description": "I will be up front that I probably don\u2019t belong in this subreddit and that my question demonstrates my na\u00efvet\u00e9. I am a US citizen in my 30s who votes in all local and national elections in each of the states I have lived in in my adult life. But my question (and joining of this subreddit) was prompted by \u201cDr. Oz\u2019s\u201d recent run for PA Senatorial seat and my unfortunate learning  of a lot of facts about him as a person.\n\nI appreciate any grace you can give me in responding to my question below. I have a PhD in a scientific discipline. This is not my area of subject matter expertise. \n\nI am assuming, based on recent events, that it is perfectly legal to be a dual citizen of the US and another country and still qualify to run for senate/federal public office (as a dual citizen of US and Turkey in Mehmet Oz\u2019s case).\n\nMy question(s):\nDoes this seem like a conflict of interest? Is it a conflict of interest? Shouldn\u2019t someone who holds one of the highest public offices of our nation only be a citizen of this nation? Are there rules/laws about it? Does anyone else share this concern? Are there other examples of this? \n\nPlease note I am not consciously xenophobic or anti-Turkey; I am just using this as an example for my question. \n\nSome self-deprecating background about me:\nI am partially blaming my relatively-decent public school education for focusing on requirements to run for president (US born, at least 35 years old, etc). In that context, for example I was shocked (and kind of pleased) to see that you don\u2019t have to be 35 years old to run for any office - which I only learned when I heard of newly-elected 25-year-old Maxwell Frost to FL\u2019s House of Representatives.\n\nAnyway, I was wondering and cursory google searches didn\u2019t lead me in the proper direction so I\u2019m asking you. Thanks in advance."

I've managed to put a bit of money on the Democrats to win 51 seats in the Senate at what I think are fairly generous odds.\n\nAs things stand this means they need to win races in Arizona, Nevada and the Georgia run off in 4 weeks.\n\nGiven the following;\n\n* Nevada votes that remain to be counted are mail in ballots from Urban areas, so the Democrats surely have a reasonable chance of overturning the GOP lead when all the counting is done.\n* Given the Democrats are ahead in Arizona, there must be a reasonable expectation they will hold on.\n* Given Warnock is the Dem incumbent in Georgia, has already won the seat in a run-off and his rival massively underperformed Brian Kemp who won't be on the ballot in the run-off... this seams like another good chance (at least better than 50/50) for the Democrats to hold.\n\nWhat am I missing that mean the odds for this aren't a 'yes, all the cards need to fall the right way, but there's a reasonable chance' to 'a rank outsider where a small bet can return a months salary'!?"

Conservatism has been damaged to its core due to the state of Republican party with now Trump vs DeSantis. What are my options in 2024? New party or join the Democrats? Likelihood of a new party out of republican is really narrow as republicans would eat that party again (center is represented by Democrats already and can't go any furthest far right). On top of that, it would be impossible for Trump to quit republican party, so the new party would be DeSantis based. Democrats have been struggling internally due to left and centrist agenda so I am hoping that after a few consecutive wins, some of Bernie/Warren/AoC/Yang folks would quit to create Universal Basic Income related party. Oldest Millennial would start retiring in next 14 years (retire early/quiet quitters) if not way earlier so they would gladly join this party and ditch democrats. Hence, democrats would be the new conservatives. I know its a pipe dream but I don't have any options to express my political right. What do you think?"

No wonder why so many GOP members are declaring no more money for Ukraine. If the American public were to hear the documented proof of their favorite politician's collusion with Putin **from Putin's own mouth**, there would be no debating it. poof gone!\n\nJust thinking out loud..."

The elites trying to protect the status quo is going to lead to a bigger divide. There are a lot of misinformed people that are blindly protecting the elites/status quo like the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. I see this going three ways: a totalitarian state where the evangelical conservative extremist police state attempts to maintain \u2018order\u2019; the disenfranchised working class rising up to literally cut the heads off of the elite; or people start working together to build a strong society that respects human rights, supports education, health care, and social services.

Move on from it already! Jeez stop asking questions about it!\"\n\nEspecially since this was clearly the Republican President of the United States orchestrating this massive crazy spectacle - the attempted hanging of VP Mike Pence and Congress to \"overturn the election\" and install the GOP to power.\n\nThey try to pin the blame on Trump solely for Jan. 6, but have done nothing but obstruct and sabotage the Jan. 6 Commission and every aspect of government possible?\n\nWhy should any of the rest of us trust what these GOP politicians have to say ever again? How can we risk letting them take power in this deplorable state?\n\nIt's hard not to be biased when I'm talking about GOP politicians literally trying to erase Americans right to vote. There isn't a person on this planet who isn't endangered by what these GOP politicians are doing, and that is not partisan or biased or rigged or unfair or \"both side\" bs.\n\nI'm old enough to remember Clinton testified - both of them, at the hands of the GOP.\n\nBut the GOP are above the same sort of duty or commitment to American values?"

Republican politicians reject real news as \"fake\" and substitute their own lies and insanity on an infinite loop.\n\nSoon, Republican and Democrats won't even be speaking in the same language - Republican voters' perceptions of politics in America is so fucking warped by this Fox News insanity.\n\nTheir world isn't real. They talk about these characters called *Obama* and *Hilary Clinton* and *Biden* \\- but they are their own separate things.\n\n*Fox News Obama* is not the real Obama. Fox News reality is not real reality.\n\nObama is this crazy socialist Kenyan Muslim whatever. They all keep going on about how Obama drone striked people.\n\nThe Republican Party *gives* their believers reasons to hate Democrats and stay loyal to the Republican Masters.\n\nRepublican voters believe they are just supposed to protect *their* team and attack *our* team - but the only team I care about is democracy and humanity and America and NATO and ensuring we all survive and thrive together.\n\nThere is no Republican and Democrat climates - we are all going to burn if we don't lower emissions NOW. Tax cuts to the rich add to the public deficit, we're borrowing massive cash on the public credit card to give to the richest people in existence - this is insane. Biden investing in replacing lead pipes at least creates good work and helps save people's health.\n\nWe can't ever stop these GOP politicians and their propagandists from seeding Americans with lies like this.\n\nBut we can absolutely raise awareness about how this is working, how these GOP politicians have been flooding the zone with lies and conspiracies for so long to bend Americans to their will.\n\nClimate change denial. Rigged elections. Obama Death Camps. Socialist Healthcare. Senile Biden Dur!\n\nSmoke and mirrors, noise and distractions.\n\nThe only thing I care about is which political party has the better healthcare plan? Which has the better affordable childcare, investment in local communities that creates jobs, modest tax increases on the rich and funding the IRS to go after rich tax cheats.\n\nWatching 63 Republicans votes *against* a purely symbolic show of support for NATO and democracy was gut wrenching.\n\nAnd then the BALLS of GOP politicians to tell us that our Ukraine plan sucks while their ranks openly shill Russian QAnon conspiracies? Biden is too weak, too slow, spent too much, too little.\n\nThis is a two-party system, which means every American voter has a choice between two options.\n\nBiden and the Democrats are the better option.\n\nGOP politicians can't just throw tantrums and endlessly throw up clouds of conspiracies and detach Americans from reality, and expect Americans to trust this worsening decline into pure cultism. This is the behavior of gangsters, not problem-solvers.\n\nIf President Obama had also been brainwashing cultists to storm the Capitol and hang the Vice President and Congress to erase the right to vote like Trump and these GOP politicians so very clearly did - I wouldn't support that.\n\nIf Republican politicians were pushing bold affordable childcare action - instead of *blocking* affordable childcare and installing judges to steal human rights and impose abortion bounties - I'd call myself a Republican.\n\nBut unfortunately that's not the world we live in.\n\nRepublican politicians passively obstruct and sabotage the future of America for their judges and tax cuts for the rich and stupid games.\n\nUnfortunately, that makes Republican politicians the most dangerous and deadly threat to all American lives and especially kids and future generations who will inherit our climate-ravaged world.\n\nWe've lost TWENTY YEARS fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan instead of lowering emissions at a stable rate.\n\nBiden is pushing electric vehicle charging infrastructure to be built across America - that means jobs for construction and electricians - this is good common-sense shit.\n\nThe GOP blocking and sabotaging everything as their strategy makes them a cult of failure.\n\nIt's like we're drowning and instead of swimming to shore, GOP politicians are trying to drag us down so we all drown together.\n\nBiden is trustworthy, he knows the job better than all his critics - especially every GOP politician greedily looking to trade places.\n\nThe GOP have revealed itself to be totally nihilistic - having no morality or sanity except blind addiction to power makes them extremely deadly and unfit to lead.\n\nAmericans who worked for GOP leaders testify under oath - but ZERO Republican *leaders* do so.\n\nRepublican politicians know they are beyond saving - their only hope is to drag down Biden to their level so they can all be failures together.\n\nI see them for what they are, and 100% support Biden to do his fucking job."

But we're finally at the end, like a television show that stayed far beyond its peak. Trump has officially jumped the shark and has become boring and a generally accepted loser.\n\nSo where did it all go wrong? There is an old saying: How can I miss you if you don't go away. I would like to call these next three parts: the three stages of failure.\n\n2018 Midterms\n\nThis was the easiest one for Trump. Most presidents lose seats in the midterms. The House was lost by many seats; however, they picked up seats in the senate from a favorable map that ousted Democrats in more conservative states. At this point there was plenty of rationalizations around keeping Trump in the Republican Party. Most presidents do badly in the midterms. Whatever.\n\n2020 Presidential Election\n\nThis is where things got complicated. Trump lost the presidency, but Republicans did well down ballot. The January 6th riots under normal circumstances, would have been enough for the GOP to rid themselves of Trump. The problem is that there were enough mixed messages from voters and a strong base in the GOP that Trump survived a second impeachment. He was hurt, but not out.\n\n2022 Midterms\n\nThree strikes you're out to use the baseball analogy. Trump's obsession with the 2020 election loss spurred election denialism around the country for two years. It met a crashing halt in November. The vast majority of Trump's backed candidates lost in crucial swing races. The GOP lost the Senate and barely gained the House. Now he's a dead man walking.\n\n2024 Presidential Election\n\nThree outcomes can happen. The first and most unlikely is that he wins the nomination and the presidency. It's possible, but something truly crazy would have to happen. The other two options are almost tied for likelihood. He loses the primary to someone like DeSantis or he loses to Biden in the general. Part of politics is knowing when to bow out of a fight you have little chance in. Trump is narcissistic enough to pull forward.\n\nTwo years left folks. It's almost over."

Installing judges to literally erase women and girls' human rights from existence like it was nothing\n\nAmerica is going a fight civil war over abortion bounties and some mentally challenged gameshow host serial rapist world's-most-obvious-Russian-backed-asset president?\n\nQAnon is at the heart of the GOP's rapid devolution into pure obstruction and power games with total nihilism and destructiveness.\n\nThe climate change denial, the way Obama was ripped for being a \"socialist black supremacist Muslim terrorist sympathizer etc etc\".\n\nRepublican politics is about flooding the zone with conspiracies and hatred against your enemies, and using that as cover to commit the same actions with total impunity.\n\nTrump showed us GOP politicians deliberately openly spew racist insanity so that, when people are horrified, they can deny it and blame \"Fake news\" and say \"See, look how the media says all *us* Republicans are racist!\"\n\nThey seed the conspiracy that Democrats run \"pedophile pizza places\" so that when the Republican President is accused by dozens of real women of violent psychopathic rape - they can say \"both sides do it\".\n\nIf you can understand how this system works, then you understand the totality of QAnon and modern Republican Trumpian politics.\n\nRepublican politicians want to erase your right to vote. So they say \"Democrats are stealing the election!\" over and over - then pass hundreds of laws and run candidates to actually mess with elections.\n\nRepublican politicians openly insist they will never let Americans vote against them if they get power - so openly admitting they want to be Republican tyrants.\n\nSo of course, the GOP have been seeding the conspiracy for years that Biden and Democrats are tyrants. So when you say it they say \"Hey, that's not fair. Not *all us Republicans* are racists/stealing votes/etc. There are tyrants on *both sides.*\"\n\nIf you can understand the simple logic of how this system works - then you understand QAnon and the GOP and understand how to overcome it.\n\nGOP politicians flood the zone with lies and half-truths targeted at their enemies, and use that as cover to commit the same crimes with total impunity.\n\nSo then to ordinary people who aren't so sure what is going on, Democrats are accusing fascism, Republicans are accusing Democrats of fascism - it all looks the same.\n\nThey kind of mirror everything back at the Democrats to create this permission system for their self-deluded failures and disasters."

        "description": "**From The Telegraph's Nick Allen:** \n\nJoe Biden on Wednesday night called for renewed action on gun control after America's latest mass shooting left at least six victims dead at a Walmart store in Virginia.\n\nA manager at the store opened fire on fellow employees in a break room as they were gathering to start their shifts on Tuesday night.\n\nOfficials later identified the gunman as Andre Bing, 31. Walmart said he was an overnight team leader, and had been with the company since 2010.\n\nThe gunman laughed during the attack, a survivor told local television. Jessie Wilczewski, who was on her fifth shift, said he appeared to target other managers. He saw her hiding under a table, and told her to \"go home\".\n\nIt came as America was preparing to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.\n\nMr Biden said: \"Because of yet another horrific and senseless act of violence, there are now even more tables across the country that will have empty seats this Thanksgiving.\n\n\"We must come together as a nation. We must take greater action.\"\n\n**\ud83d\udd13 This article is free to read:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/11/23/virginia-walmart-shooting-multiple-people-killed-injured/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/11/23/virginia-walmart-shooting-multiple-people-killed-injured/)"

They create their own reality and demand aggressive loyalty to their lies and punish all those who refuse to play along with these sadistic Republican games.\n\nSo the Trump children dabble in fascist cults and cancerous corruption and betrayals - and Hunter Biden has his laptop.\n\n*Both sides are the same.*\n\nOf course, we all know these GOP politicians and Fox News are living in their own self-deluded fantasy world.\n\nCall me *senile*, but I think President Biden's agenda - like affordable childcare, climate change reduction, infrastructure and voting rights are infinitely better than Republican agenda - like abortion bounties, tax cuts for the rich, suicidal climate change denial, and literal bloody coup attempts.\n\nI don't care about a politician's age or anything - just who has the best climate change plan, best handle on complex geopolitics, intelligence dealing with Russia and China.\n\nThat is Biden, not these GOP politicians and their QAnon clown cult.\n\nAll this talk about Hunter Biden, but they still refuse to testify about what they did on Jan. 6, they still impose abortion bounties, still obstruct affordable childcare.\n\nMike Pence, Kevin McCarthy, Mitch McConnell still *refuse to testify under oath about the attack on the Capitol after TWO YEARS.*\n\nI thought Benghazi was bullshit - but I remember Clinton showing up to testify! Both Clintons testified under oath for hours!\n\nWhich makes them infinitely less corrupt than all the GOP politicians put together.\n\nThe GOP can craft infinite reasons why they believe Biden is a terrible president and Trump, DeSantis or some other Republican should take over.\n\nBut all of these are self-deluding lies - the reality is Biden is competing with Obama to be the best president in the last 30 years - while Bush was a disaster and Trump was the worst rapist traitor failure batshit insane terrorist Fox News freak we've ever seen.\n\nBush was a disaster, but nobody ever worried he was going to terrorist attack his own Capitol to hang the Vice President and Congress. That is a new level of detached dangerous insanity.\n\nThe GOP should be learning from Biden, agreeing with what works and pushing better alternatives where he is lacking.\n\nWhere is the GOP climate change plan? I remember Al Gore and the Democrats wanted to lower emissions in 2000.\n\nIt's TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER, they still have no plan except to obstruct and sabotage whatever the Democrats achieved.\n\nObama and Biden were the first to lower emissions in US history since the Industrial Revolution - who better to lower them again?\n\nAbortion Bounties, decades of suicidal climate change denial and sabotage, $1,900,000,000,000 in tax cuts for the rich, literal bloody coup attempts, an ex-President psychopath stalker who won't leave us alone.\n\nWhere is the GOP's affordable childcare? They got time for abortion bounties, nothing for pre-K or school infrastructure?\n\nThey can't just flood the zone with attacks on Democrats and Biden and get away with endless treasons and disasters like this.\n\nRepublican politicians have to create their own opposite world, where Biden is senile and corrupt, and Trump and the GOP are unfair victims.\n\nThey tie their actions to their base of tens of millions of voters.\n\nTrump will openly praise neo-Nazis and call them his lovers - and then the GOP brainwash their followers to insist it never happened and demand evidence.\n\nLike were you all asleep on Jan. 6? He was openly praising neo-Nazis \"I love you, you're very special. Never forget this day.\"\n\nDid tens of millions of Americans all forget instantly what happened?\n\nThey're practicing this behavior of mass amnesia and bullying to make these Republican politicians' treason disappear."

People are getting hurt, lives and families are being torn apart by these twisted failures. There is a reason Putin and Saudia Arabia back the Republican Party.)\n\nIt is literally the president's main job to *peacefully* transfer power to ensure the survival of the republic - and Americans voted for the one person absolutely fixated on failing his job in the worst way imaginable.\n\n>*These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!*\n\nHave tens of millions of people already all forgotten the worst betrayal and treason in the history of the United States, committed less than two years ago?\n\nI haven't forgotten.\n\nTrump tweeted that right after the attack and told his cult terrorists he \"loved them\" and they were \"very special\".\n\nThis whole Republican brainwashing operation is decades of worsening failure and disaster.\n\nTrump, Republican politicians and Fox News are extremely dangerous and deadly to all Americans and must be voted out of power at all costs.\n\nThey are obstructing and sabotaging and causing us all endless disasters so, when it is reported in the news, they can accuse the news of being \"liberal/fake\" and groom people to their \"alternative news\".\n\nThey groom themselves and each other to block out reality and push hyper-insane Republican conspiracies to create cover for their own actions.\n\nTrump showed us how this works.\n\nThey accuse Democrats of \"stealing\" votes, and use that as cover to actually fuck with elections.\n\nThey accuse Biden and Democrats of being crazy, and use that as cover for their hyper-insanity and treason and failure.\n\nThey obstruct President Biden's affordable childcare and voting rights protections and climate change for their abortion bounties and tax cuts for the rich and literal bloody coups (plural!)\n\nFox News and GOP politicians are pumping sickness and death on a global scale.\n\nIn 2022, America and the Republican Party have become the cradle for fascism in the democratic world.\n\nALL Americans, even the ones voting for it, are endangered by this runaway cult and its perpetual disinformation machine."

The rational is you couldn't trust some minor locally elected governor to have the power to send the military to invade the Capitol - it is a power reserved for the highest office. Which Trump and his allies knew.\n\nTrump obviously refused to send backup to the Capitol, because he was loving his \"totally peaceful, patriotic Lovefest\", as he called it on Fox News afterwards.\n\nThis is sick, the GOP are practicing these group manipulation tactics.\n\nThey casually dehumanize Democrats but flip on their backs and claim they're the victim when they're caught and people are horrified by these Republican politicians' actions.\n\nTrump the Republican President of the United States openly celebrates neo-Nazis terrorist attacking the US Capitol to hang everyone to \"overturn\" the election.\n\nSo of course when people call these GOP politicians a racist cult, they flip on their backs and say \"See, look at how the liberal media calls *all us millions of Republicans racists!* They're racists!\"\n\n\"How can you blame *all us millions of Republicans* for the actions of a few hooligans who went to far?\"\n\nSo Democrats and BLM are to blame for all riots, Nancy Pelosi is to blame for Jan. 6 - but it's unfair/baised/rigged to blame these Republican politicians for the worst treason and failure and freakshow disaster in history?\n\nBush was another Republican disaster - but nobody every worried he was going to terrorist attack his own Capitol to hang the VP and Congress. That is a new level of insane.\n\nThey can't explain it, so they don't. Instead they use the insanity of it as a weapon to generate more conflict and separate their followers from the rest of us. They create reasons to hate Biden and drag him down to their debased level by pushing conspiracies and alternative realities - because that is the only way they can win elections now.\n\nWould anyone seriously like to claim the GOP could do a better job handling Russia that Biden and the Democrats? The Party openly pumping Russian conspiracies into America's heartlands through Fox?\n\n*Antifah, MAGA, stolen election, emails, the laptop from hell* \\- It's all just fucking noise now. Nothing means anything.\n\nWe all tune into our own private little world on the internet, and there's nothing to referee what is real and what is total horseshit. No guardrails.\n\nPeople just grab onto the internet and go off into fantasy worlds - and then we mock them when they have no idea what the fuck is going on.\n\nIt's like a man-made plague that can wipe us out with the sheer volume of bullshit."

        "description": "Trump showed us the pattern.\n\nThey flood the zone with accusations against all their enemies, and use that as cover to commit the same crimes and treasons with total love from their 74+ million votes and cash donations.\n\nThey say \"CNN is fake\" as a way to dismiss any reality that makes them look like the nightmare cult they have become.\n\nTrump, the Republican President, has become like a social-political cancer - in large part because to tens of millions of Americans, there is so much contradictory bad information they are distorting reality.\n\nWhen Trump says \"People are saying...\" The idea is you get tens of millions repeating the same lie until it becomes their new reality.\n\nRepublicanism is about loyalty to the lie. That's why they punish people like Liz Cheney and President Biden who don't follow their lies, and reward liars and failures like Trump, Kevin McCarthy, and this Walker vampire fellow from Georgia.\n\nClimate change lies, Jan. 6 lies, abortion bounty lies, Iraq and Afghanistan lies.\n\nThe Republican Party is engaged in information warfare on Americans in a way that other groups don't have.\n\nThere is no \"Biden Cult\" like there is a Republican Cult.\n\nEven though Biden is infinitely better than all the Republican politicians I have seen in the last 30 years combined, most people don't like him or trust him.\n\nWhy? In large part because Trump and the GOP have figured out the key.\n\nFor every one story on the internet about Biden that rationally explains his agenda and activities - there is a million articles and smash-cut videos about how Biden is a senile old man who doesn't know where he is and is destroying America.\n\nMitch McConnell understands better than anyone the number one objective is to drag down the Democrat President, fuck him up, rile up massive furious disgust and hatred against him, sabotage his agenda, spread lies and conspiracies about him-\n\nThen use that to win the next election: Now 2024.\n\nThe Republican agenda is about stabbing America to death and making all our lives worse and causing chaos and distractions to demoralize Democratic voters and harden Republican voters into a weapon.\n\nPresident Biden is like Al Gore - people were not very excited about Gore in 2000, but can you imagine if we spent the last 22 years lowering climate change emissions instead of fighting wars in the ME?\n\nThe GOP cause disasters so they can pin the blame on Democrats and obstruct and sabotage us so we all fail together.\n\nThis ties in to QAnon, because the number one objective is to groom angry white men into joining the Republican cult and hating Biden - even though Biden is infinitely better for all Americans than Trump and the GOP.\n\nThe GOP pass massive tax cuts to the rich that in the short-term boost the economy, at the expense of causing long term inflation.\n\nThey crash the economy and hand over to the Democrats a flaming pile of garbage in 2021, while immediately trying to pin the blame for all their failures and madness and treasons and literal bloody coups on Democrats.\n\nThat \"Fuck Brandon!\" bullshit - this thing about Biden destroying \"America's oil independence.\"\n\nIt's all lies. They hate Trump because he is showing us all their strategies.\n\nThey just take credit for whatever works, and pin the blame for all their failures on their enemies.\n\nBiden is the most progressive president in my lifetime. He would sign abortion rights into law in a second if it could pass Congress.\n\nSo do I blame Biden for being a failure because he can't pass abortion rights, or do I blame the ones who are dedicated to passively obstructing everything instead?\n\nIf Americans punish Republican politicians for their QAnon nightmare cult by voting Democrat in HUGE numbers and encouraging others, it forces them to stop brainwashing people.\n\nTrump won 74+ million votes, the second-highest in US history. He showed they can do this kind of bullshit and get away with it.\n\nRight now, GOP politicians are brainwashing Americans about the events of Jan. 6, trying to deflect blame for their mass treason and failure onto scapegoats: Nancy Pelosi, the Capitol Police - anyone but Trump and these GOP politicians.\n\nUnderstand the game they are playing, and you understand what QAnon is and the connection to the GOP and the decades of worsening Fox News madness."

What would happen, or how would a candidate be viewed in the public eye, if they publicly supported the Bin Laden family for doing a humanitarian deed in Saudi Arabia? How easily can things be interpreted and how much does a candidate in any political race have to take care of his public image?  Would the press say that this candidate is on the side of terrorism, even though he supports the Bin Laden family because this family did a humanitarian deed in Saudi Arabia, without any connexions to Osama Bin Laden?\n\nSorry if I disturbed anyone."

        "num_comments": 2,
        "description": "I've been waiting for this day for a long time. I was born in the 1990s and throughout my entire life, the GOP has played the same electoral playbook. In the 90s it was Limbaugh and talk radio. In the 00s it was Fox News. In the 10s it was right wing internet trolls. It does appear however that this strategy that has worked for them in the past has finally collapsed in on itself. I'll explain.\n\nThe Reagan Revolution truly changed politics forever. It's not an overstatement, but just a fact. The country starting in the mid 1970s was gradually moving right and the GOP capitalized on it. One of the most successful changes was how we consume media. The elimination of the Fairness Doctrine that required media to offer differing perspectives changed how we watch and read the news. Now media could be truly partisan and confrontational like never before. An early benefactor of this trend was shock jock Rush Limbaugh. His brash, controversial brand of conservatism radicalized a whole electorate to asshole conservatism. It paid dividends in the 1994 midterm elections where Republicans took the House and Senate from incumbent President Bill Clinton. It was a stark change to the more optimistic conservatism of Reagan. But this idea while fresh at the time, like all new ideas eventually becomes passe.\n\nIn the 00s during the Bush years, the right was doing fine. Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly filled the airwaves with conspiracies, controversial statements and revenue. It was a boom period before the internet took over since most Americans still relied on cable and satellite. The wind was at their sails from the aftermath from 9/11 and the GOP could indulge in their radicalization. For now.\n\nThe Obama years and the 2010s offered a shift for the right, but also a point where they jumped the shark. Cable news was becoming almost comically reactionary like with Glenn Beck and his chalk board. The internet was rising with right wing grifters like Milo Yiannopoulos and Steve Bannon. All this culminated in the election of Donald Trump in 2016. At the time it was the apex of right-wing extremism. The climax of racism, sexism and reactionary politics all present on the world stage. What they didn't know is that everything was falling apart and had been for a while.\n\nThe average American is pretty straight forward. They want a good job to support themselves and maybe a family and generally be left alone. What the right-wing circus did was cross that line into post-policy where it became entirely a personality cult. There just aren't enough Americans to buy into that to win electorally. With cable news dying including Fox News, the right wing grifters losing influence with the crackdown by big tech; the echo chamber had finally collapsed under its own weight. People got tired of being outraged.\n\nThe 2022 midterms finally showed that electorally, but the message was clear from January 6th and well into the Trump presidency. In the 1970s, America was moving to the right. Some might not like that that happened but it did. In 2022, America is moving to the left and no number of investigations into Hunter Biden's genitals is going to change that. My message to the GOP: Adapt or Die."

        "num_comments": 4,
        "description": "So it's not secret that the district court judge in the case of Trump v. United States was a Trump-appointed judge. Also, it the general consensus that she appointed that special master mostly to return the favor to Trump for giving her a lifetime job.\n\nWell, if Trump is inevitably indicted, what would happen if another Trump-appointed judge in that district was assigned to handle the case? While it isn't a foregone conclusion that, by dint of him being a Trump-appointed judge, he necessarily is going to be biased in favor of Trump (after all, 2 of the 3 appellate court justices were also Trump-appointed, and they overwhelmingly publicly shamed the first District Court judge), the fact that a Trump-appointed judge has already shown favoritism means that it is still a possibility that the next Trump-appointed judge will do the same. After all, being publicly shamed by the Court of Appeals isn't the same thing as a sanction, and that first judge is still free to issue biased rulings from the bench.\n\nAt least with the civil case, the government had the right to appeal the verdict. But in a criminal case, once the defendant is acquitted or has his charges dismissed FOR ANY REASON, then that's it. Case closed. The Defendant walks. It doesn't matter if the judge was biased, or if he issued a blatantly unlawful ruling. An acquittal or dismissal of charges of any kind cannot even so much as be appealed, for literally any reason whatsoever. See Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141 (1962).\n\nIf a district judge not appointed by Trump gets appointed to his criminal case, we're in like flynn. But if a Trump-appointed judge gets appointed, the prosecution only has one option: File a motion to recuse, a motion which the judge can simply deny. He can point to the fact that the appellate court panel in the related civil case was 2/3 Trump-appointees as proof that he is not necessarily going to be biased in favor of Trump, and once he does that, the prosecution will have no further recourse. If a Defendant moves to recuse and that motion is denied, he can file an appeal only after he's convicted (as opposed to what  Glenn Kirschner publicly described as \"the hamster wheel of endless appeals\" in civil cases that Trump was hoping to exploit in order to run out the clock). But if the proseuction moves to recuse, that motion is denied, and the biased judge proceeds to issue a directed verdict in his appointer's favor, then that's it. Case closed. Trump goes free.\n\nIs there anything in place - other than the nucear option of impeachment - to safeguard against a scenario like that?"

Pro NATO is very centrist to me. Reducing climate change - there is no liberal or conservative climate, we're all going to burn ourselves alive like jackasses if we don't lower emissions as fast as possible.\n\nThe GOP have been obstructing climate change action for DECADES.\n\nAl Gore and the Dems ran on lowering emissions in 2000, 22 years ago. Obama and Biden lowered emissions after Bush, but then Trump reversed everything he could.\n\nThe GOP are bottlenecking Congress and stonewalling the Jan. 6 investigation into their treason and attempt to erase the Constitution from existence and install themselves to power.\n\nTrump is the most honest Republican leader because he admits what they are all about."

Tells you everything you need to know about how much better Pelosi is than the GOP. Pelosi is even trying to push stock trade restrictions on Congress - GOP fighting like hell to block it, but blaming her anyways.\n\nYet despite demonizing Pelosi for years and sending brainwashed cultists to hang her and her colleagues and then bashing her husband in a Republican hammer attack - they casually blame her for the Republican suicide terrorist attack on the Capitol orchestrated on the Capitol to hang her.\n\nThe reality is Trump's betrayal of the Constitution is actually nothing compared to the rest of the GOP politicians all brainwashing and stonewalling and seeding vile conspiracies.\n\nThe GOP politicians' behavior to Jan. 6 makes the coup and treason itself infinitely worse, I believe. And every day the GOP continue to seed rage and lies and deflect blame, they become more twisted.\n\nInstead of turning away from Jan. 6 - they used their sadistic conspiracies to pass hundreds of laws modifying elections to their liking.\n\nThey claim they are only asking for voter ID, then shut down polling places in black communities and ban them from drinking water in long lines.\n\nThen when GOP politicians are called out for their hyper treasons and corruption and racist atrocities - they flip on their backs and say \"see how the liberal media accuses *all us millions of Republican men* of being racist? So unfair!!! What about antifah?\"\n\nThey are incentivized to be racists so they can deflect accusations of racism to all their \"Republican\" followers."

        "description": "They seed the conspiracy that President Biden is a senile foolish weak old man to create a mirror shield for their hyper-insane Russian asset serial rapist ex Commander in Chief.\n\nBecause they obviously can't have everybody talking about just the their hyper-insane old Republican President, they need a Democrat opposite to whip up hatred and cash donations against.\n\nBecause none of them can rationally explain why their president would spend four years brainwashing a massive cult explicitly to sabotage elections and terror attack the Capitol to hang the VP and Congress - so they don't explain it. Just flood the zone with equal and opposite disgusting lies and insinuations.\n\nLike you can't just have dozens of women risking their lives and sacrificing their privacy to detail horrible sexual violence committed against them by the Republican candidate in 2016 - so they seed conspiracies about Hilary Clinton and Democrats running \"pedophile pizza huts\".\n\nSo Trump is accused by dozens of real life women of raping them, even as children - Capitol Police testify under oath the GOP President caused the Jan. 6 terrorist attack on them and left them all to die.\n\nAnd Hilary Clinton runs a \"pizza pedophile place\". President Biden has clips of him looking funny and stuttering - *he doesn't know where he is???*\n\nBOTH SIDES ARE THE SAME.\n\nHey, why does the \"senile\" old man President Biden have infinitely better infrastructure and climate change reduction action than these GOP politicians?\n\nWhy are GOP politicians *stealing* sick days from rail workers - just so they can pin the blame on Biden?\n\nThe GOP would love a rail strike because they could crash the economy again like they did in 2020-1 and 2008-9 and blame us for the disasters they cause.\n\nIt's brainwashing - installing judges to literally erase all women and girls' human rights from existence forever in America *like it was nothing -* then claiming Trump and the GOP politicians are the victims and we are all being unfair?\n\nThis is disgusting abusive behavior - and everybody knows it.\n\nAdam Kinzinger revealed that Republican politicians are trying to \"memory hole\" Jan. 6 - as a strategy, they are bullying all of us into denial about their hyper-treason and Trump MAGA cult fascist murder cult.\n\nThey can't explain it, so they don't - just bully and attack all of us, terrorize trans people, accuse black people for their white supremacist terror attack to erase 81 million votes and collapse democracy to install the GOP politicians to power at all costs.\n\nI talk to so many believers in these Republican politicians - they act like they've never heard of the Jan. 6 plot to hang Nancy Pelosi by the GOP - or about their abortion bounties, or their decades of climate change denial. They even blame Afghanistan and Iraq now on Democrats - but they would have crucified Obama if he pulled out of their war and the country collapsed.\n\nThese information warfare tactics are too extreme and vile and are breaking the brains of the people trapped with this Republican Trump cult and their lies on top of lies on top of lies.\n\nThey lie so damn much their words have lost all meaning. Republican politicians and Fox news are grooming our friends and families with twisted lies for votes and cash donations and to deflect blame for the worst treason and failure and disasters we have ever seen - and EVERYBODY reading this knows it, even if they act like they don't.\n\nJan. 6 was the most livestreamed and witnessed terrorist attack and coup attempt in human history. If we know what happened when the Capitol was attacked in 1812, we sure as shit know what happened in 2021 and exactly the gangster politicians responsible."

And Mitch McConnell may not end up crossbowed in the privy by a Trump fanatic, he will certainly live on forever as a total toilet person.\n\nLike Tywin, Mitch McConnell will do a great deal to stop Trump from keeping his power over everyone because he obviously understands he is far too insane and psychopathic. They need a ruler that is stable they can control.\n\nAnd like Tywin, McConnell's avarice and cruelty will ruin him - and almost certainly all of us too.\n\nI heard Mitch once give an interview claiming he was fighting for his people - and I wished I could shake him and say \"Look what you've done to your people!\"\n\nUnlike Joffrey, Trump needed to win elections - and the GOP did strange things to \"their\" people to cling to their power and their stupid abortion bounties and tax cuts to the rich."

How is this not an assassination attempt? Because he was using the GOP QAnon brainwashing to kill for him?\n\nAnd Capitol Police are direct first hand witnesses to Jan. 6. They fought in it. And many are also military veterans - so they have expertise in terrorist attacks - especially when they are in one.\n\nSo how can any media organization say \"riot\" when it is clearly an insurrection, a terrorist attack, a coup attempt and an assassination attempt.\n\nThe President openly plotting to murder a room full of America's top elected officials in a single afternoon is bound to be very complicated and very messy.\n\nWe should embrace that there are many ways to look at this evil committed by Trump and these GOP politicians on Americans with their brainwashing lies and conspiracies.\n\nThey create their own reality and groom their followers to block out Jan. 6 because they can't rationally explain anything they are forcing themselves to do to us."

Immigration of course, the loss of jobs with outsourcing and the focus on being culturally progressive over economically protectionist and working class focused which many in the US disagreed with, to an even further extent than the UK, we never did the whole culture war shit so the issue was less the cultural progressiveness and more the loss of economic collectivism over here.\n\nNow its been nearly 8 years. Trumps out of office (for now anyway) so i think we can try and have just this one discussion without it devolving into a MAGA vs everyone else civil war thats been going on since 2016.\n\nWhat about trumps policies and obama's 8 year administration made you go from voting for the liberal who promised  \"Change\" to the conservative who promised to \"Make America Great Again\""

In this case he is hoping to delay and also to get matters to the Supreme Court which he cynically hopes will come through for him, rather than for justice."

        "description": "These GOP politicians think they can light our house on fire and try to steal our right to vote - and then blame us for dealing with their hyper insane freakshow disasters and hell.\n\nThe great thing about America is that people can vote their leaders in and out of power.\n\nTrump has revealed GOP politicians refuse on pain of death to accept all of us as equals.\n\nThey're targeting black voters, women, immigrants, school teachers, election workers - trans people especially I want to call out GOP politicians for seeding violent conspiracies against right now.\n\nRepublican politicians are literally putting targets on the backs of all our trans friends and community members.\n\nTrump showed us how the dog-whistle/megaphone nods to racist conspiracies they seed to Americans to groom them into a cult. When they are caught, they blame \"fake news/liberal media\".\n\nIf the GOP President can openly send brainwashed cultists to hang everyone at the Capitol to install the GOP to power against all of our consent - and they virtually all play along with it - this shows the ENORMOUS danger these GOP politicians are to Americans and their families and friends.\n\nAll our trans community are in danger from people consuming hyper insane sexualized conspiracies being mass seeded to Americans by these Republican politicians and Murdoch disinformation empire.\n\nPeople are getting killed - they are getting our friends killed to rile up more conflict to win the 2022/2024 elections and demoralize us from showing up to vote Democrat.\n\nRepublican politicians are seeding violent hyper distorted sexualized conspiracies targeted at trans people, and use the hatred they generate to pass laws and rile up Republican votes and cash donations.\n\nThey are getting our family killed to win elections for the Republican Party against the Democrats.\n\nAll this madness, sickness, horror and death has been about one purpose: To win Republican politicians absolute power over all of us and force themselves to control our lives against our consent.\n\nThese GOP politicians are dangerous to all Americans, and voting for the Democrats is *the* first and last defense against this fascist cult now.\n\nPresident Biden has already done an infinitely better job dealing with this Trump crap while focusing on accomplishing big tasks.\n\nClimate change reduction, affordable childcare, healthcare, pre-K, a global minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nVotes + Money = Power in America\n\n**The beauty of a two-party system is either we let the fascists win - or we vote them the fuck out in MASSIVE numbers at every level in every election.**\n\n**They stacked the deck against us, so we have to stack it back by rallying MASSIVE OPPOSITION TO THE GOP POLITICIANS' CULT AT ALL COSTS.**\n\nWe did pretty good in 2022 holding the line, but we need way more votes in 2024. Way too many ordinary people still believe Biden is senile and \"both sides\" are the same.\n\nBiden is pushing the John Lewis voting rights protections to ensure black voters get equal rights to Republican white voters - GOP politicians are ALL obstructing it for their God damn abortion bounties and bullshit.\n\nThat means I know who must win and lose in 2024 to get voting rights protections for all of us - everybody should know this decision is binary and very simple."

        "description": "They're blaming Nancy Pelosi for the plot to hang Nancy Pelosi and her friends and colleagues to install Trump and the GOP to power over all Americans against their consent.\n\nThis week, Republican politicians pushed a drastically twisted version of Jan. 6 where Nancy Pelosi - and not they - were responsible for the murder and torture and insanity rained down on the Capitol Police.\n\nMilitary veterans with experience in the wars started by the *last* Republican President testified that *this* Republican President caused a \"terrorist attack\" in the US Capitol and left them all to die.\n\nSome say it was the worst combat they've ever experienced. So after the GOP launch the wars and bury us into the mud and force these people to sacrifice so much for so little.\n\nAnd then on Jan. 6 the GOP again get Americans hurt and killed for their stupid conspiracies and bullshit.\n\nThey will try to accuse us of ranting, being unfair, biased, mean, rigged - but it is a gross bullying tactic.\n\nWhen 26 women risk their lives to detail the horrible things the Republican Cult Leader did to them - the GOP groom Americans with these lies that this is \"fake news/liberal media/both sides do it.\"\n\nI refuse to support violence - whether that's some punk on the street rioting and looting - or the Republican President of the United States and these gangster brainwasher GOP politicians.\n\nI think most Americans are good and want what's best for this country.\n\nBut these GOP politicians are not it.\n\nTrump showed us the GOP seed lies and conspiracies as a way to groom loyalty to them.\n\nThey say it's all fake news/both sides do it to bully Americans into accepting unlimited debauchery and failure from Trump and these GOP politicians \n\nThese accusations against Nancy Pelosi are a mega escalation of some serious disturbing pattern of reality denial and erosion and memory manipulation.\n\nAdam Kinzinger warned Republican politicians were trying to \"MEMORY HOLE JAN. 6\".\n\nIt is a gross twisted abusive vile manipulative tactic.\n\nThese GOP politicians can't explain why their leader would terror attack his own Capitol to hang them.\n\nSo their strategy seems to be to create an alternative reality where they are the victims of Jan. 6 and Democrats and Capitol Police are to blame."
