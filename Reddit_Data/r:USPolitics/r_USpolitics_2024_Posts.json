Joe Biden or Donald Trump (I\u2019m expecting them both to be presidential candidates). I cannot for the life of me decide who I should vote for as I have no political allegiances to either the Democrats or the Republicans. I would love to hear some substantiated reasoning for why I should/shouldn\u2019t vote for one or the other. I\u2019m not looking for things such as \u201cBiden hates democracy\u201d or \u201cTrump orchestrated the Insurrection\u201d but genuine good/bad things that one or the other has done. I want to vote for the person who will best serve the interests of not just America, but the world. I couldn\u2019t think of what to put in the URL so I just tagged wikipedia lmao"

        "description": "Please pardon my ignorance. I am Canadian with a crappy political system as well. \n\nMay I ask, why does the USA always have geriatrics as their president? I understand experience comes with age, but so does short term memory loss, and medical issues. I am not normally interested in. Politics and do not understand your country, nor mine to be honest. They are lacking, and needs much improvement.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why our systems are run by people who have an agenda other than country improvement. I actually had hope with Trudeau, which evidently has shown younger isn\u2019t necessarily better.\n\nI feel that anyone who goes into leading a country is already doomed in their role. They can make promises, but the countries needs are so egregiously out of their hands that campaign promises seem to be moot. \n\nIt is great to have idealism, but both of our countries are so far in debt, that nothing can really be changed. The leaders hands are so tied. \n\nI work in healthcare, and our needs are so complex that no matter what budget we have, it will never be enough to provide safe patient care.  I feel this is the same for the leader of our countries. The leaders come to such a debt-laden system that nothing can be changed. Or changes that can be done are challenging. \n\nDespite this, I don\u2019t understand why geriatric persons are selected. Perhaps we need new blood. New ideas. New chances for setting up for change. \n\nPlease know I am not attacking your leaders or your country. I am simply trying to understand, and perhaps see how both of our countries can find a way to change.\n\nI have a controversial question for those who have made it this far in my post. Why is trump so popular to potentially help this crisis. This isn\u2019t about his fame, his political aspirations. It seems hard for me to understand why a person with bankruptcies, and celebrity status could potentially help these crises. I am not interested in his controversial campaign or personality. I don\u2019t understand how he could help the USA to regain the leader status it once had.\n\nPlease don\u2019t attack me, I am not interested in political party vs political party. Just a basic understanding as to why he would be a good candidate. \n\nI understand this post might get heated. I am not trying to anger anyone. I am simply trying to understand politics in my country a bit more, and the motives for electing certain officials. I hope I have explained myself effectively in the kindest way I can. I appreciate your time to help me understand."

But for president voted for Biden. \n\nMy question is for those who think Trump incited an insurrection on Jan 6. What makes you think that? Because I just watched Trumps speech right before the capitol was broken into and I just don\u2019t see it.\n\nBelow are some quotes I collected from the speech.\n\n\u201cI know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the capitol building, to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we\u2019re going to the capitol. And we\u2019re going to try and  give\u2026 the Democrats are hopefulness they\u2019re never voting for anything, not even one vote. But we\u2019re going to try and give our Republicans\u2026 the weak ones because the strong ones don\u2019t need any of our help, we\u2019re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.

If you still have resources and a desire to help go to your local DNC branch office and see what you can do. We got this - it is CRYSTAL CLEAR the way majority of people DO NOT want what Trump is selling. People are tired and worn out I get it but this is not the time for apathy. Maybe you'll be fine if Trump is elected. However LGBT, veterans, the disabled, the sick and any woman of child bearing age is squarely in this fiends crosshairs.

It is astonishing - also because the court invokes the Bible rather than medical expertise to specify life, writes DN's Elsa Kugelberg.\n\nWhen a curious patient wandered into the ward, opened the freezer, and dropped a number of embryo containers on the floor, it was the start of one of the strangest disputes in Alabama history\n\nWere the destroyed Embryo A and Embryo B (and so on) persons? That's what the parents meant. In that case, the clinic had contributed to the killing of human children on their premises. The question was whether the law could be interpreted in a new way, so that the case would no longer be understood as a - certainly particularly serious - breach of contract.\n\nThe state's highest court ruled on Friday just this: frozen embryos are persons, and thus their destruction falls under the law against the killing of minors, which is now understood to \"apply to all unborn children, regardless of where they are.\" In that way, the IVF ruling can be seen as an extension of the abortion ban that already applies in the state."

It had none of the \"trickle down\" effects they promised - 40 years on they are still fooling folks with that bit. Why should villianaire EVER pay less in taxes than a working class individual ? Can you really talk about fiscal responsibility if you are constantly giving away the store? This will cause Red Hat Cult members to twist themselves into a pretzel in order to come up with the lies needed to tell themselves to believe that \"of course a villianaire should pay less in taxes than I do\".

        "description": "> On Monday, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed a Colorado Supreme Court decision removing Donald Trump from the ballot because of his engagement in an insurrection on Jan. 6. But that top-line holding is where the unanimity ended because five conservative justices just couldn\u2019t help themselves: They went much further than the case required, announcing an entirely new rule that Congress alone, through \u201ca particular kind of legislation,\u201d may enforce the constitutional bar on insurrectionists holding office. As the three liberal justices pointed out, in a separate opinion that glows white-hot with indignation, the majority\u2019s overreach \u201cattempts to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to their holding federal office.\u201d They are, of course, correct. After this decision, it is impossible to imagine a federal candidate, up to and including the president, ever being disqualified from assuming office because of their participation in an insurrection."

        "num_comments": 5,
        "description": "The situation underscores the perverse state of affairs in which UnitedHealth, which comprises some 2,642 separate companies that collectively raked in $371.6 billion last year, has arguably profited from the desperation that the hacking of its Change computer systems in late February has inflicted upon the health care system. An estimated half of all health care transactions are processed or somehow otherwise touched by Change, a rollup of dozens of health care technology firms that provide 137 software applications that have been affected by the outage. \n\n>**Every dollar in revenue that has disappeared from hospitals, medical practices, and pharmacies in the aftermath of the outage corresponds to an extra dollar sitting in the coffers of the nation\u2019s health insurers, so UnitedHealth, which pays out roughly $662 million in medical claims each day, is presumably sitting on a mountain of unexpected cash.**\n\nThe situation in Corvallis reveals a second potential benefit for UnitedHealth, as a discount acquirer of broke medical practices. UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum subsidiary is the largest employer of physicians in the country, and it can add to its stable by securing purchases of companies put into a terrible position by its own ransomware hack.\n\n\nJoshua Corman, former chief strategist of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) COVID task force, said that **the Change hack \u201chas created a massive going-out-of-business sale \u2026 There are so many distressed assets to prey upon.\u201d**/\n\nOregon\u2019s House of Representatives recently passed a bill to close loopholes in its corporate practice of medicine law that would prevent anyone from controlling physician practices who is not a licensed physician. But though the bill advanced through a state Senate committee, Senate Majority Leader Kate Lieber failed to bring it up for a vote. This puts Oregon even more at risk from seeing private equity and other investors gobbling up their health care practices in a fire sale.\n\nBut the massive insurer has been thus far reluctant to share its wealth with the desperate health care providers that can\u2019t bill it, rolling out an emergency zero-interest lending program that has offered health care providers loans as small as $10 to \u201ctide them over.\u201d Last week, a suburban Philadelphia physician whose $6 million-a-year practice was offered all of $3,300 by UnitedHealth\u2019s emergency loan program told the Prospect that the outage could force her to sell her otherwise profitable 80-employee practice for far less than its worth just to keep the lights on.

Our dependence on industrialized factory farms for our food supply increases the likelihood of such a public health emergency, Lieder says. Bills currently before Congress that would limit states' ability to set standards for such operations, combined with limitations on public authority enacted in the wake of the pandemic, would weaken both protections and regulators' ability to respond.\n\nThere needs to be a hard look at the public health system\u2019s continuing ability to act when serious threats emerge, says Brian Castrucci, CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, which supports health efforts. Even if more transmission from cattle to humans occurs, tools exist to contain it, but may be effective only if public health departments are adequately staffed with trained workers. The foundation estimates that public health departments need 80,000 more full-time employees just to deliver basic services.\n\nThe country\u2019s pandemic response capability is only as strong as the state that is least prepared, Castrucci says. This is an opportune time for every state to make a comprehensive pandemic preparedness plan that incorporates learnings from COVID-19, and for states and the federal government to look for ways to work together against diseases that pose national, not state-level, threats."

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "The election of 1824 is most famous for the \u201ccorrupt bargain,\u201d a deal in the House of Representatives that gave John Quincy Adams the presidency despite his winning fewer popular and electoral votes than Andrew Jackson. But 1824 was also significant for another reason: it was the first election in which the majority of states used a statewide winner-take-all voting method for choosing their presidential electors.\n\nIt is a system that now seems like a fundamental part of the American democracy. Presidential candidates compete to win states, which is how they get votes in the Electoral College. The U.S. Constitution does not mandate that system, however. Instead, it is left up to the states to determine how they select their representatives in the Electoral College. For the first 13 presidential elections, spanning the first four decades of the history of the United States, states experimented with many different electoral systems.\n\n**TLDR The shift to statewide winner-take-all was not done for idealistic reasons. Rather, it was the product of partisan pragmatism, as state leaders wanted to maximize support for their preferred candidate. Once some states made this calculation, others had to follow, to avoid hurting their side. James Madison\u2019s 1823 letter to George Hay, described in my earlier post , explains that few of the constitutional framers anticipated electors being chosen based on winner-take-all rules.**\n\n[**Democracy vs Republic**](https://youtu.be/a_BZ1b5e5Bk?si=mymepvnMxaHzCZiu)\n\n[Election of 1789](https://youtu.be/DZO1O3CeW2w?si=ycl-ZLsFGD4bvgKa)\n\n[Election of 1824](https://youtu.be/fVrW5fPyu-M?si=lbZEAAEVuirv4Lp3)"

I\u2019m sure you do but in case there are anyone deniers this all happened. I\u2019m sure you remember him demanding loyalty from people. \n\nTrump left Flynn out to DRY full stop. He didn\u2019t care if he was prosecuted, went bankrupt, went to jail, lost everything lost his home to pay legal bills even though he had the full power to stop it. He took 4 years to pardon him!! You think he cares about you?? He does not care about ANYONE. \n\nWhat about Rudy Giuliani begging him to pay his legal bills to him and help me pay his legal bills.  TRUMP won\u2019t help him, but demands the RNC and his voters pay for his\n\nGuy couldn\u2019t remember a single verse out of the Bible then sells sacrilegious bibles with the constitution on them.

Now he\u2019s saying \u201cWe are going to bring you back\u201d Yea so we can run you over again six ways from Sunday.\u201d\n\nThis is absolute insanity people would fall for this unbelievable crap. I tried telling people about this they won\u2019t even respond. Taking to a brick wall.\n\nDude was right when he said he could shoot someone and get away with it. At least with his base he could. They would just say \u201cwhat about all the migrants that kill people that\u2019s Biden!\u201d  Or who knows make more shit up. \n\nRant over."

        "description": "\n\n\nMaine's proposed new state flag bears design similarities to one in the national headlines recently. But experts said the flags have separate and distinct histories.\n\nThe so-called \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag was carried by rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, and features a pine tree as a central element.\n\n\nThe design was originally used by American gun boats during the Revolutionary War, said David Martucci, former president of the North American Vexillological Association. \"An Appeal to Heaven\" references the cannons on the boats, and revolutionaries protecting themselves from British tyranny.\n\nBut the controversial flag was also reportedly seen outside Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's New Jersey Beach home, and was hung outside the Northeast Harbor home of conservative legal activist Leonard Leo.\n\nMartucci said it's not the first time a movement has adopted a flag without understanding the historical significance.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer that historic flags should be respected and not abused,\" he said. \"If they really want to symbolize a different kind of a movement, that they should be creative enough to come up with their own designs.\"\n\nMaine's original state flag also features a pine tree, along with a blue star, but has a distinct look and history, Martucci said.\n\n\"That flag represents the people of Maine period, all of us,\" he said. \"And I think that's understood by everybody. I don't think that any possible confusion between the two flags could exist.\"\n\nMaine's pine tree flag was developed entirely separately, Martucci said. The pine tree represents Maine's people, and the blue star represents the state motto: Dirigo, or \"I lead.\"\n\nThe pine tree design was adopted in 1901 as the state flag, but was replaced with the current version \u2014 a blue background with the state seal. In November, residents will vote to decide if the pine tree design should be reinstated as the official state flag."

If he is elected could he not just pardon himself?\nMy real question:\nHalf of Trumps campaign consists of \"this is a with hunt, democrats are ruining America, this is rigged, I'm the victim\", etc. Etc. Etc.\nSo if Biden pardon him do you think it would negate his claims? Would it just be twisted to \"see even Biden knows this was a farce\" or whatever"

And I can\u2019t come up with any factual statements about how this trial was a politically motivated hit piece and a sham? There\u2019s talk about the judge\u2019s political leanings but that coin flips both ways. If he didn\u2019t vote for Biden he\u2019s probably have voted for trump. So that\u2019s out as a motive. There discussion about it being held in nyc (liberal town) but from what I can find trump himself was super involved in the juror selection process. There\u2019s talk about the gag order, but that would apply to anyone who goes off online and talks about a currently ongoing trial and making personal accusations. There\u2019s obvious hate for cohen ( who is a dickhead) but the prosecutions literal job is to call witnesses that support thier arguments which is the whole reason cross examination exists. People keep saying the trial shouldn\u2019t have been brought in the first place but I can\u2019t find one actual fact provided for why it shouldn\u2019t have? All I see from the right news is conjecture and vague statements. What am I missing? Genuinely curious. Not trying to be a biased jerk or start a flame war."
