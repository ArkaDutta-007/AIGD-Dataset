        "description": "As we all know currently the United States is going through yet another government shutdown. Now frankly I think that asking for better border security is something that every political party should be a part of. The United States has never once had fully open borders and never will. Look at all the terrorism that has happened over the years in Europe especially in countries that have open borders. The United States will not be a victim of that. However the majority of the people in the US government are as usual stuck in stalemate. Now I am not I democrat or republican. I am a registered independent. Unfortunately the Independent party doesn't really have much of a voice in American politics. We've never once had a presidential candidate make it into the final Runnings as a member of the Independent party. It's always been either a Democrat or Republican. Neither of these political parties are ideal. However even if we never get an independent party President we need a much greater group of members of the Independent party in u.s. government. You can never have just two sides there must be three. If we had three sides then you would never have to worry about the house, senate or congress all being controlled by one political party. Majority rule is the better option. Not to mention it would be ideal for as I said doing away with events that could result in government shutdowns.\n\nThere's also the fact that the people in the US government don't seem to remember how they got to their current positions. Like the Constitution says. Of the People, by the people, for the people. Meaning the people of the government are representatives of the people. They were put in their position by the people and thus they work for the people. If anything the American public should be telling the people in the national government what to do not the other way around. Unfortunately individuals like Pelosi have completely forgotten this.\n\nThere's also the fact that there needs to be a term limit in organizations like Congress and such. We should stop complaining about the individual that stays in the white house for four to eight years and more about the people in the Capitol building that stay there for 30 to 40 years. It is time for the American government to go through a massive culling."

If he probably loses in court, he still gets massively publicly known and that is promoting him. if he manages actually win in court, like Trump gets a too lowly regarded penatly, he can claim to successfully defended the case Donald Trump. Either way, he can make his opportunity of a lifetime with this lawyer job, if he's smart enough to keep out of anything that can damage him."

All this blatant social injustice is a problem everywhere, and right now *ONLY* France, Serbia and Hungary are going on the streets here to voice their disagreement. But the politicans don't care about us, just like with you guys, so we sit in the same boat.\n\nUS politics are my favorite, whenever i read depressing news here, about germany still legalizing castration of pigs without any painkillers, about this fuckup with Volkswagen cars or about Serbian PM saying openly to the people that he gives no fucks. Then i go to places like r/USpolitics to laugh at Trump and lighten my mood. It's easier to laugh about places far away.\n\nNow, i noticed a huge support for economical justice and that the majority of you guys are opposing this BS House of Cards played in real life. And come 2020, i hope you guys do something great. And that people like AOC or Sanders will shape your country and make it truly Great again.\n\nI know the EU vs USA Banter is sometimes a bit too seriously, but after all this decade long bad reputation USA has with the bombings in the middle east, and being too involved in our business, i really believe that many here will applaud you for taking the right course of action.\n\n Things look worse here in certain countries, with endless amounts of idiots supporting this hateful BS by politicians, so i will cheer if you manage to pull a change in society next year. It's all up to you, but you can set us an example America, please do it! I know it's hypocritic but i would welcome you guys having a word with our bastards by then\n\nWith regards,\nsocialist third World Europen shithole (aka Germany)\n\n"

        "description": "Hi folks\n\nJust randomly curious about bills in House/Senate with members of Congress from different parties on BOTH sides of the bill. Needs a bit of explanation. \n\nThis is what I have in mind...\n\nTake a bill that has 45 YES and 55 NO votes. (Senate example).\n\nOf the 45 YES, let's say there are 42 D and 3 R. So the minority representation in the YES vote is 3/45.\n\nFor the 55 NO, let's say its 50 R and 5 D, So the minority representation in the NO vote is 5/55.\n\nSo, the measure of bipartisanship would be 3/45 \\* 5/55 = 15/2475\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith this measure, the most bipartisan a bill can get will be 1/2 \\* 1/2 so, a truly evenly split bill would have a bipartisanship measure of 1/4. That's what I meant by \"members of Congress from different parties on BOTH sides of the bill\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust curious what were the bills in history that generated a split going across party lines, in BOTH the YES and NO camps. Happy to learn about bills that are very bipartisan as measured in other ways as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"

        "description": "If you haven\u2019t heard of it, the Radio Lab podcast has an *excellent* explanation in its episode \u201cTweak the vote\u201d\n\nA quick run down.\n\nIn this system, a ballot would list each candidate. Let\u2019s just say: \n\nTrump\n\nHillary\n\nStein\n\nSanders\n\nVoters would then select, in order, who they prefer most. So in this scenario one might cast their ballot as such:\n\n4 Trump\n\n1 Hillary\n\n3 Stein\n\n2 Sanders\n\nOnce voting is completed, ballot collectors would then organize people\u2019s ballots by 1st choices.\n\nSeeing as Hillary and Trump were both primary candidates it\u2019s reasonable to imagine they would often be selected 1st choice.\n\nConsidering the way the popular vote went, we\u2019ll say this hypothetical US gave  1st choice ballots out as such:\n\nHillary gets 100 ballots\n\nTrump gets 90\n\nSanders gets 30\n\nStein gets 25\n\nIn this scenario, the candidate with the least amount of 1st choice ballots gets canned. That *candidate* is toast, but those *voters\u2019 voices* are still in play.\n\nThose Stein ballots then get sorted by who was listed as #2. As a Green Party member, there\u2019s an interesting mix of libertarian, conservative, and left progressive environmental.\n\nLet\u2019s say 12 of those go to Trump 10 to sanders, and 3 to Hillary. \n\nOur new \u201cscoreboard\u201d is:\n\nHillary has 103\n\nTrump has 102\n\nSanders has 40\n\nYikes, it\u2019s getting close. Unfortunately for Reddit\u2019s dreams, our hypothetical Bernie is now the new low. his votes now slide over to their next choice.\n\nNow, many Bernie voters are left leaning and chose him as opposed to populist candidates, but the \u201cshake things up\u201d attitude also came into play. Regardless  30 off Bernie\u2019s ballots slide to Hillary while 10 slide to Trump. Leading to this outcome:\n\nHillary gets 133 ballots\n\nTrump gets 112\n\nHillary wins.\n\nNow I suppose you can see how this could also lead to a \u201csanders\u201d coming up from the rear.\n\nIreland utilizes this method currently and several US cities do as well. \n\nIt often leads to candidates becoming more moderate to represent the largest deaths of the population. This as opposed to the current US system where an elected official only has to appeal to his/her base and disregard the other portion of the country."

        "description": "For the record I love RGB... she is an inspiration and I want nothing but the best for her. For 2 months she has not been seen or heard from by ANYBODY though and that has lead to rumors of her being dead or in a medically induced Coma in Nevada. I figured this had to be BS because maybe she was out of the country or lord knows what, then this:\n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/01/22/politics/rbg-oscar-movie-nomination/index.html\n\nSo the makers of the RGB film called her at her home and talked to her according to this article.\n\n>She congratulated us and said the nomination was 'eminently well-deserved.' She sounded strong and cheerful and said she is writing opinions and continuing to stay on top of work.\"\n\nOk... cool. So why didn't CNN just give her a call at home to confirm the story with her? She has never hidden from the media and surely wouldn't have minded a phone call especially if she writing opinions and staying on top of work which there is also no evidence of. Also, if she is at home then how is it that nobody can get any evidence of that? Surely there is at least one nutjob or kook trying to get proof of life chilling and waiting to snap a photo of her taking out the garbage or watering her plants but nope... nothing. The media should be doing a bit more digging rather than just taking a third parties word for it, right? Also, if anyone would know for sure what is happening it would be WaPo and instead of updates on RGB we get stuff like this:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-clinton-campaign-sought-dirt-on-trump-from-russian-officials-wheres-the-outrage/2018/08/02/dee4be12-9672-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html?utm_term=.864e07b879a4\n\nWhy the sudden pro-Trump turn besides avoiding the same fate as Buzzfeed and Huffington?\n\nSomething isn't stirring the kool aid and I would love everyones' thoughts, left right and moderate. What is your theory of where she is and her status?"

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "Recently, California has started to go after Mom and Pop FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) sellers for back taxes regarding uncollected sales tax.  Even though these small sellers have no direct ties to California, the state is arguing they are retailers and have nexus due to Amazon's fulfillment centers in those states.  These FBA sellers have no control over where their products are shipped and have very little control over the sales process as it is controlled by Amazon.  \n\nAmazon has deliberately avoided collecting sales tax in these states in the past because it granted them a competitive advantage over other brick and mortar businesses like Walmart as they could make sales without a tax and this led to more sales for them.  They also have made the claim that it was the Mom and Pop FBA sellers' responsibility to collect these sales taxes even though Amazon is obviously in a better position to do so as a billion dollar company and it controls the sales channel.  They did this to  avoid having to pay the back taxes, penalties, and interest payments which would be significant.  Nevertheless, they are starting to agree to Marketplace Facilitator agreements now with the states where they will collect sales taxes for all sellers moving forward.  So we have a bit of a double standard going on where they want to take responsibility now but not in the past.\n\nThis situation has put states in limbo regarding how to handle this sales tax issue for the past years.  States that are in better financial shape are simply moving forward and not worried about any back sales taxes.  Other states like South Carolina are bringing action against Amazon directly  rather than targeting Mom and Pop sellers.  Finally, you have California that is aggressively targeting the small Mom and Pop sellers because they are in poor financial shape and desperately need the money because they couldn't say no to their constituents and/or balance their own budgets.  California had also previously started to go after Amazon directly but their actions were thwarted by other members of their government.  Basically, a sweetheart deal was struck with Amazon as Amazon has the leverage of having a number of fulfillment centers in California and can pull those jobs if it so chooses.  Thus, Amazon was able to escape responsibility.  But California apparently couldn't move forward and so now is targeting the Mom and Pop sellers.\n\nIt should be noted that the act of paying sales tax is not as simple as simply cutting a check or collecting because each state has different laws in terms of filling out forms and you open yourself up to other potential taxes like franchise taxes and possible income tax liabilities when you register with a state.  States like California have a very byzantine process that makes it a nightmare to fill out such returns.  When you consider that there are 50 states and each process is different with some states having nightmare processes, you can understand why these Mom and Pop sellers did not file in all these states as the amount of time needed to complete these returns takes weeks if not longer.  Remember many of these are people who are starting new businesses and are needing to create new processes and are unsure if their business will even work.  Yet, California acts as if they have a dedicated staff who can manage these returns like they are a Fortune 500 company.   \n\nWorse yet, if another state chooses to follow suit like California, it will lead to at least 50% of these FBA sellers going out of business because none of them collected the sales taxes.  That is a large number of American Mom and Pop sellers.  And they will only be targeting the American Mom and Pop sellers too as about 30 to 40% of these sellers come from China and other Internationals (because Amazon encouraged them) but California and other states will not collect from those sellers because they are unable to do so as they are out of the country.  So the result will be that they will only target Americans in other states.      \n\nI am just curious if other people are aware of what is going on?  In addition, where do you think the responsibility lies on these matters?\n\n&#x200B;"

They can blame the democrats again for holding things up, and this time, oh, this time, the average joe blow will take that hit, and the GOP hopes they can deflect these people not getting returns onto the democrats for \u201cfailing to compromise\u201d, aka: failing to give in to fascism. \n\nTheir line will be that Drumpf tried to reopen, and the Dems blocked him. It is really quite masterful deflection, and I\u2019d hope we can spread some counterpoints to it.\n\nChange my mind. "

Gillibrand is in the Senate, not the House. If it isn't an actual law, wouldn't she be immune to punishment since she is not a House member? \n\nI've tried searching for this but only come up with the same exact text over and over again, no interpretation of it. All that is said is it \"MAY violate House rules.\" \n\nDoes anyone know how the House rules work for someone who is not a member OF the House?"

I am fired up and I want to marry my passion with my skillset in stats/data science and help someone in whom I believe hopefully get elected President or Senator (I am a Democrat).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould anyone know where to start? I have been working with some contacts but would like to reach out directly and start doing this more intensely."

Growing up in Texas and then moving to California in my sophomore year of high school and it struck me hard how different the beliefs were, however it seemed that in both places the ignorance of the information was very very bad. I want to try and spread light upon different subjects from a more republican standpoint, however I am always open to other people's ideas and what they have to say. My main goal in this is to see if I can get a decent following and then eventually try and start a podcast with my roommates at college. Hope y'all are well and if you have any questions shoot them my way. Looking forward to the journey with y'all diving deep into the wonder that is the US politics!!"

        "num_comments": 4,
        "description": "The Neverending Story of Republican Economic Incompetence\n\nHere's the standard Republican Economic Playbook ever since Reagan took office in 1981:\n\nStep 1: Republicans get into power and then cut taxes as much as possible on the rich and big corporations.\n\nStep 2: Republicans brag about how the economy has improved on essentially borrowed money since reduced tax income means that more money must be borrowed to offset the loss in taxes. Interest will then have to be paid on that borrowed money for a long, long time, thus reducing the ability of the government to invest in people and programs.\n\nStep 3: Republicans suddenly notice that less tax money is coming in, and cut government spending on programs for the poor and middle class.\n\nStep 4: Republicans undermine unions as much as possible to try and help their corporate friends pay as little as possible in wages. Over the long term, this results in regular people having very little money. Republicans also resist raising the minimum wage and resist all wage increases as much as possible. This also results in the poor and middle class having little money over the long term. Income inequality expands. The well off get richer, and everyone else gets poorer.\n\nStep 5: Republicans avoid much-needed infrastructure spending programs, which would help the nation by providing jobs, growing the economy, and increasing the amount of taxable income which could help pay off debt.  Republicans tend to avoid big infrastructure programs because they have convinced themselves that, in general, Government Spending Is Bad\u2014except on certain things like expensive military weapons, in which case, they seem to believe that one can never spend too much.\n\nStep 6:  Republicans watch in total surprise as businesses start collapsing, and more and more regular people start defaulting on their mortgages, bank loans, and credit cards. Since most businesses cater to the poor and middle class, when regular people do not have any money, most businesses end up with fewer customers, and thus, little money. Welcome to another Republican created recession.\n\nStep 7: Republicans do little to fix the recession, since fixing the economy would involve reversing what the Republicans actually did while in office. Eventually, voters put Democrats back into power, hoping that the Democrats will be able to fix the bad economy. The Democrats increase Government spending with an infrastructure program to counteract the economic slowdown caused by the Republicans. Republicans scream bloody murder about how the Democrats are creating government debt with their spending. As Republicans do this,  they ignore the huge amount of government debt which was created by 1) Republican tax cuts, 2) the economic slowdown caused by Republican cuts in spending to pay for their tax cuts, and 3) the economic slowdown caused by Republicans fighting unions, fighting wage increases, and fighting all efforts to implement big infrastructure programs.\n\nStep 8:  The economy slowly recovers due to measures which were both pushed for by Democrats and fought against by Republicans every step of the way.\n\nStep 9: After years of economic improvement under Democratic leadership, Republicans spend countless millions of dollars trying to convince voters that they will do a better job with the economy than the Democrats did.  Voters eventually vote the Republicans into power.\n\nStep 10: Go to Step 1.\n\nhttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/3/19/1841608/-How-Since-Reagan-Republican-Administrations-Always-Lead-To-An-Economic-Meltdown-in-10-Easy-Steps"

You just need to donate $1. We can do this.\n\nBTW. If you want a young president Gabbard, Yang and Buttigieg are your best options. If you want someone who won't go after nations that aren't threatening or attacking us. In other words won't get us in on another Iraq style blunder. If that's the most important thing to you. Then Gabbard's your strongest option. If you want a president that will treat our soldiers and veterans well.

        "num_comments": 16,
        "description": "The health care systems are admirable in countries like Sweden and Australia but I don't think we should assume that it is the best system for the United States.  Andrew Yang and Elizabeth Warren as far as I know are running on health care in 2020 and I want to offer a challenge to their proposals.  \n\nThe United States under the current system covers 91.2 percent of the population, a bloody good effort.  I'm certain yhe Affordable Care Act has improved that number and whilst I'm not optimistic about the ACA at least it was targeting the people who are outside the 91.2 percent.  \n\nElizabeth Warren wrote an article saying 60 percent of bankruptcies are due to medical shocks.  Her paper has been challenged and some say it is not possible to determine a accurately if a health care shock led to the bankruptcy because there are so many other factors involved.  Others put the bankruptcy from medical shock at 4 percent rather than 60 percent.  The media bankruptcy argument is often used to justify universal health care and but I don't think we should assume that everyone without health insurance does not have the means to pay for it.  Many people take the risk, and actually use bankruptcy as a kind of \"implicit health insurance.\"  \n\nThe medical system is inneficient and low value that is true, but what sense does it make pump more government tax dollars, your dollars into a broken system?  Where will the incentive come from for hospitals to become more efficient and improve their care when all they have to do is bill the government and it is paid no questions asked? \n\nAmericans have an idea of charity in the system to support the minority that can't afford care.  Non profit hospitals are tax exempt and they must provide a public goods and that public good is to provide charity care.  Hospitals by law cannot turn away patients who cannot pay.  The hospitals I would argue earn enough revenue to cover for those that cannot pay, or alternative arrangements are made so people can pay what they can afford.\n\nAmerica has a problem but I'm tired of hearing the calls for universal health system.  The United States is on the cutting edge, it is a free and independent society and I'm confident we can come up with a solution to the problem that doesn't involve the government stepping in to intrude by spending our money for us.  When did we lose our spirit of independence where we have half the population supporting universal health care (last poll I checked)?  \n\nI'm confident there are solutions to the problem but we are retreating too early from letting private individuals organise themselves.  We need to look at the employer based insurance system, it provides 50 percent of the population with insurance but that model distorts the market, as only companies and not individuals can barter and negotiate with the strength of economies of scale.  \n\nSolutions should be found not by politicians, they should come from doctors and other medical professionals to sort this out.  To vote on and support such a drastic change, would be unwise because as mentioned, we would be pumping money into an already inefficient system, and it will only get worse and more bloated with government involvement. \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on the topic."

To me it seems very authoritarian to try to get someone to vote for someone they don't like. Just let someone vote for some in a more honest way.

No questions asked, get these people the help they need. I don't understand why congress is basically shoving a big fat middle finger in their faces by not even being present for this hearing. It should be without thought, and without question that we should provide healthcare for these people.\n\nAre our elected officials really that out of touch? Are they really so concerned with other matters that they couldn't even give the first responders the respect and care that they deserve for doing their job not only as NYFD/NYPD members, but as Americans and most of all, human beings. It's disgusting, it really is that it's come down to what I've seen today."

        "description": "With the continuing discussion of whether the electoral college should or should not be abolished, I decided to break down the numbers for how representative the electoral system is. What I did was divide the number of electoral votes for each state by that state's population (2016 US Census Bureau estimate), which gave me the distribution number. Next, I took the lowest distribution number (Texas) and divided 1 by it, giving me the normalization number. I multiplied the normalization number by the distribution numbers.\n\nWhat this does is give us a view of the \"weight\" of a single person's vote in that state. This does not factor in the number of people of voting age, registered voters, or actual votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. Additionally, the numbers presented have been rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**'Weight' of a citizen's vote in the electoral college by state**\n\n*  Alabama - 1.39\n* \u00a0Alaska - 3.07\n* \u00a0Arizona - 1.16\n* \u00a0Arkansas - 1.5\n* \u00a0California - 1.05\n* \u00a0Colorado - 1.19\n* \u00a0Connecticut - 1.48\n* \u00a0DC - 3.23\n* \u00a0Delaware -\u00a02.34\n* \u00a0Florida - 1.03\n* \u00a0Georgia - 1.15\n* \u00a0Hawaii - 2.13\n* \u00a0Idaho - 1.72\n* \u00a0Illinois - 1.19\n* \u00a0Indiana - 1.24\n* \u00a0Iowa - 1.44\n* \u00a0Kansas - 1.56\n* \u00a0Kentucky - 1.35\n* \u00a0Louisiana - 1.3\n* \u00a0Maine - 2.26\n* \u00a0Maryland - 1.25\n* \u00a0Massachusetts - 1.2\n* \u00a0Michigan - 1.21\n* \u00a0Minnesota - 1.35\n* \u00a0Mississippi - 1.52\n* \u00a0Missouri - 1.23\n* \u00a0Montana - 2.13\n* \u00a0Nebraska - 1.96\n* \u00a0Nevada - 1.49\n* \u00a0New Hampshire - 2.23\n* \u00a0New Jersey - 1.19\n* \u00a0New Mexico - 1.8\n* \u00a0New York - 1.12\n* \u00a0North Carolina - 1.09\n* \u00a0North Dakota - 2.98\n* \u00a0Ohio - 1.16\n* \u00a0Oklahoma - 1.34\n* \u00a0Oregon - 1.26\n* \u00a0Pennsylvania - 1.18\n* \u00a0Rhode Island - 2.86\n* \u00a0South Carolina - 1.34\n* \u00a0South Dakota - 2.57\n* \u00a0Tennessee - 1.23\n* \u00a0Texas - 1\n* \u00a0Utah - 1.43\n* \u00a0Vermont - 3.62\n* \u00a0Virginia - 1.15\n* \u00a0Washington - 1.2\n* \u00a0West Virginia - 2.09\n* \u00a0Wisconsin - 1.3\n* \u00a0Wyoming - 3.92"

I\u2019ve been struggling with this one though:\n\nThe left seems to want some form of socialism in the country, Medicare, wealth distribution, censorship of free speech etc. \n\nRussia\u2019s communism is a close facsimile of these ideals, so it baffles me as to why the left would be so upset with Trump being cozy with Putin and the Russians. Wouldn\u2019t the left cheer for that kind of friendship?  And in the same breath, doesn\u2019t it seem ridiculous that the Russians would want a capitalist in office (referring to the voter \u201chacking\u201d), rather than a democrat who would have ideologies closer to one another?  I just don\u2019t see how calling out trump for being a Putin supporter wouldn\u2019t be celebrated by the left?!?"

I think a better system would randomize the primaries, but leave them staggered rather than going all at once, and have an inbuilt bias towards smaller states going first, but also push back states that had earlier voting dates in previous cycles.\n\nSo for example, Wyoming, Montana and Delaware might be the first to vote next cycle, being smaller states, while Texas, New York and California would be last, being biggest. Next cycle the smaller three would move to the middle of the pack, while Texas, New York and California would be replaced by Ohio and Florida at the very end.\n\nThis would let smaller states get a chance to matter and have their issues heard, and also put national candidates in settings where they have to win over people in small groups, face to face, and then build up to bigger battlegrounds as momentum grows, while also preventing candidates pandering to one states single issues cycle after cycle."

        "description": "Our \"Day of Reckoning\" has come.  We are beyond the point of no return on legalizing cannabis. We are also at the point of no return (As Trump has ultimately figured out) in which they aren't going to entirely 100% take away medical coverage from those getting it under Obama.  Sure, it's greatly reduced and barely limping along after Trump shot it in both Kneecaps, yet, it perseveres. \n\nThe masses all seem to agree we want/need/are entitled to universal healthcare.  The debate is constantly about paying for it.  Well, why don't we legalize and tax cannabis, the feds can take that money, and give us universal healthcare. \n\nYou aren't sure the legalization will cover it? From what I've seen on an individual state-per-state basis leads me to think it will.  At the moment, the sky is the limit when it comes to sales, as they say. The more the government opens up the industry, the greater the gains will be, the more healthcare we can afford to cover. \n\nI just don't see at this point how, a Dem saying \"My plan to legalize Cannabis will pay for 60, 80, 100? percent of the Medicare-For-All (or whatever) costs will be covered!\" wouldn't pretty much lift that candidate above the rest of the crowd, at least for the moment.\n\nI think that person would be carried on the masses shoulders at this point."

I know that the US has had a shameful past, and I know that those with socioeconomic privilege have, and still do, oppress others unlike themselves and make opportunities limited for certain genders, races, and classes.\n\nWith greater access to education and information in 2019 than any other point in American history, I believe that since information about the injustices of the United States' past and present is more available than ever. This has created a lack of patriotism among many. I find very few people who are proud to be Americans in 2019.\n\nI believe the way forward is not only to gain the best understanding of the problems surrounding America's past and present, but to actively engage in ensuring a brighter future with greater opportunities for all. To do this, it's necessary to understand the issues and become an active voter and citizen. I have abstained from most of the polls for my adult life because I do not know enough about the political agendas or issues of those in power, and I don't want to make a mistake. The only election I participate in is the presidential election, but I believe this is not enough. \n\nI want to make as much of a difference to this country as much as possible, but I don't know where to start. Where can I learn more about modern political issues and problems so I may gain a better understanding of the USA, in 2019?"

This way of life, inevitable, seeps into the way the land is governed. As they believe.\nSaddami Heussein was a man of all three scribes, a man who prevented civil unrest, which is why people were okay with him as overseer, or oveilier, not \u201cdictator\u201d.\n\nThe war that the US brought to this land began as a way to establish our presence there in a region that was \u201con the brink of war\u201d, to topple or oust Saddami - and it wasn\u2019t for refinery oil until after it started - which was stupid to say, officially - when Iraq was a land that had plenty of it, and Saddami was a man who was willing to share.\n\nMen and women started killing themselves, hoping that the US would see what they were doing to their country. They didn\u2019t really understand why the US was there - an image of a US soldier giving an Iraqi-an girl a flower comes to mind - but it was uninvited, it was unwanted, and many believed it was destroying their country.  Which ultimately, it was.\n\n9/11 had just happened. There was a problem with Turkish airspace. Israel and Palenstini were on the brink of war. Saudi Arabia needed an ally. There was a war in Afghanistan. Pakistani was siding with Iran on one matter, and siding with Afghani on another. And Jordania wanted peace.\n\n\u201dThe US realized they had made a huge mistake, and needed to quickly rebuild the country, and get the hell outta there.\u201d \n                          - Rumsfeld, 2005/2007"

It makes the Dems look like they ar \"coming 4 yer guns\" at the absolute worst time for them to make this stand. \n\nThis is pretty much a lose/lose politically for the Left and a despicable win for the Right.  Unless the Dem's do not react.  Do not take the bait. just..  grieve, support the victims and deliver positive messages when in front of the media.\n\nIt might seem \"Too soon\" or \"insensitive\" to look at the politics of these tragedies. It might be difficult to think \"how can you worry about an election down the road, at a time like this?!\" \n\nWell.. Ask yourself.  What is Trump worried about? what is he looking at? These thoughts are all that matters to him right now. As such, it would be ignorant not to do the same on the other side of the fence."

        "num_comments": 14,
        "description": "History repeats itself. From Columbine to now, it seems politicians are still damn clueless of the real issues. First off, I really feel sorry for the victims of the past weekend mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, it is a very depressing problem that mass shootings are still a thing happening, and I hope that the responsible people behind these atrocities are punished with the full extent of the law.\n\nThe thing is that recently many GOP politicians are bringing the exact same tactics to the table. Yes, for the very first time Trump blames racism as a factor that drove Patrick Crusius since it was extremely evident. Due to El Paso being a hate crime, it's very likely that Crusius will be given the death penalty by the US government. Aside from racism, Trump and many Republican politicians are still wanting something else to take the blame for the shootings. Again, videogames are a major factor. It's like we are in the 1999 all over again, not only because we are having a 90s wave of nostalgia in Disney films that are being summer blockbusters like Toy Story and Aladdin, but also because external factors that are not gun control. Remember Columbine? It was not weapons but rather videogames, rock music, the internet, movies, everything else. Politicians are public administrators that hold control of a country, and if parents, teachers, priests learn what they are saying, then there will be another moral panic, again. The goths and metalheads of yesteryears are the videogames of today.\n\nBut, what about the weapons? Sure, before you wingnuts shove me with the 2nd Amendment argument like you usually do while you wear your shirts \"Two Things every American Should Know to Use (The Bible and Guns) Neither of Which are Taught in Schools\", first off, I strongly support that people carry weapons for self defense purposes ONLY. Switzerland is a relatively peaceful country, and people have access to weapons because law allows them to. But the difference is what kind of weapons they have access to. Why would you want a freaking assault rifle or an automatic shotgun? Do you work for a private security company? Are you in the Army? Do you really need it? **Weapons themselves are not evil, let's not demonize them the same way GOP politicians do with videogames. Let's not fall in their cheap blaming game**. It's like nuclear energy. There are always hippies who oppose it despite it is a clean source of energy because of its past use in warfare.\n\nGuns themselves are not the problem but THE LACK OF CONTROL. Don't go full Ted Nugent and face the harsh reality of things. The lack of control in guns selling is the real problem. Civilians SHOULD NOT gain access to high powered weapons like assault rifles or explosives, because those are military issues. Not only Crusius. How did Nikolas Cruz, Adam Lanza, Stephen Paddock, James Eagan Holmes, and many mass murderers gain access to powerful weapons? You can't predict what people will do. Nobody expected a Crusius, that's for sure. People always have to be prepared because gun violence is a threat that threatens to happen everyday, everywhere, not only in the US but worldwide.\n\nBack to the topic, what sets me off, is that politicians don't want to face reality. It's absolutely disgusting that they cared more about their precious guns and their rights to bear arms than real problems and the victims, and still want to blame everything else. Ok, maybe Crusius was influenced by a violent videogame. Still, why does everybody who enjoys videogames must carry with the burden? I don't find it fair, because anti-gun control supporters say that just because of a rotten apple doesn't mean that everybody who carries weapons must be a heartless ice cold killer. Sure, that's absolutely correct, but why they don't apply that same argument vice versa? I enjoy violent videogames, extreme and loud music, and I don't have the urges to harm people because I'm different than those assholes like Crusius and Cruz in the sense that I know of the consequences of bad actions. \n\nHave in mind that I don't want to denounce the whole GOP Party because this is not a problem of being conservative or liberal. This is a problem of being an airhead who doesn't have a grasp of things. What grinds my gears is the people who are stubborn as a donkey. Many of them are old men who are as clueless as antivaxxers or antiGMOs, because they either don't understand modern things or, even worse, don't want to understand, and rather blame other things. And the worst part of this, is that they are entitled of expressing themselves because free speech. Free speech is a beautiful thing, sadly it is a double edged sword because stupid people can express their dull and shallow ideas."

        "description": "I know this will just get downvoted to hell but hear me out. Im not saying that we shouldn't do certain things like making an effort to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illnesses. I just don't think that stricter gun laws will be enough to fix the problem or even make much of a difference. If someone wants to go on a killing spree bad enough, fear of jail time isn't going to stop them. It may make it more difficult and that's great but it doesn't solve the real problem.\n\nThe real problem we have is hate. We're so divided in this country. Our politicians and our news networks spend so much time talking about how dangerous the \"other sides\" are that it drives people into a frenzy and creates a climate of chaos. As long as our main focus is how \"bad\" people of other races, religions, political affiliations, etc. are, we'll always have a problem with hate and outrage.\n\nMy only point is that, until we learn to bridge those gaps and find a way to care about each other more, new laws will only be a bandaid at best. We have to stop convincing ourselves that the people we disagree with don't deserve our consideration and that our way is the only way.\n\nI'm not saying we don't need new laws. I'm saying we need to do more tgan just pass new laws."

I\u2019m a big Joe Rogan fan tho and I just watched his podcast with Bernie and he really seems like one of the few politicians who actually care about the people. Not just trying to get a cut for himself, but stands up against US\u2019 corrupt political system. \n\nI also don\u2019t understand how could be people against free health care and free (higher level) education when he is planning on financing it from the 1%\u2019s money not your average Joe\u2019s taxes. (And don\u2019t forget the 15$ minimal wage from 7$). \n\nIt just seems like he is trying to implement already working systems from other countries into the us. Which mainly benefit the working class (so about 95% of the people). \n\nI\u2019m not here to argue since I don\u2019t know the other candidates, but just the fact that the top 100 richest companies have paid $0 dollars in income tax to the us government and the past 20 years. Should be enough to reform the system and tax them big boys to pay for our comfortable living."

        "title": "US POLITICS from a german perspective : Regarding free education and universal healthcare. I have an honest question to all politically active or engaged americans. I feel like there must be something I'm missing ...",
        "num_comments": 8,
        "description": "Americans,\n\nas a german, who has lived his entire life with a well functioning social insurance system, the concept of workers and salarymen - even those highly educated with good to great annual incomes - can be pushed into crippling and life altering debt by a freaking hospital bill, is so outlandish, foreign ... and actually crazy to me.\n\nJust like the fact that poverty basically gets passed down from generation to generation as a heritage.\n\nBecause if parents didn't go to college or university chances are - unless something extraordinary happens - the kid sure as shit won't go to college or university either.\n\nGermany is Economically very strong. Yes. But so is the US. Hell, your GDP is 5.5 TIMES OURS.\n\n\nLet me break down how it is in germany.\n\nAnd if you take the time to read it - in which case you'd have my thanks - I have but one question to ask all of you americans stuck in a system that could easily be so much better : \n\nWhy does your nation seem to be *POLITICALLY* UNABLE & - worse yet - from the looks of it UNWILLING to make a radical paradigm shift on these matters ? \n\nSurely, this cannot be a question of money.\nIf anything, it'd be a matter of financial redistribution.\n\nIt would be literally better for *everyone*. How  come that so many hard working american  people don't see or understand this ?\n\nAnd what is it with these arguments of \"they just wan't free stuff\" or \"that's socialism\". That is hilariously stupid.\n\nAnyway, this is how it works in germany :\n(It can work in the US, too)\n\n#Education\n\nEducation factually *is FREE*. Full stop.\n\nStarting with primary school where you learn to spell and calculate up to 10. All the way through a college masters diploma in engineering or even finished medical or law studies with a PhD.\n\nPayed for entirely by taxes of the people as a whole. No matter who you are, what your job is, or if you even work at all or if you ever payed any taxes whatsoever.\n\nEven if one is jobless and uneducated, in germany all children have the same default chances when they enter primary school at age 6. \n\nEvery child has the chance to break the cycle of poverty and break away from their parents shortcomings. At least theoretically. Many of these poorer families are rather dysfunctional, which of course is a big problem, but that's a whole different topic.\n\n\n#Universal Healtcare\n\nYou do pay for mandatory universal healthcare insurance with each paycheck, but the monthly amount you pay is directly linked to your salary, in direct correlation. You earn more, you pay more. You earn less, you pay less.\n\nIf you are longterm-unemployed or even live on welfare (funded mainly by income tax money payed by the working population), you - guess what - STILL ENJOY the same universal healthcare as anyone else. Even if you never payed one cent into the system.\n\nBecause almost everyone else DOES pay into it. And so we can affort to pay for the single mom on welfare, the retired old man needing nursing care or the disabled young man with no family.\n\nThat's why it is called SOCIAL INSURANCE.\n\nBut the fact that the amount you pay for your universal healthcare is tied to your salary doesen't mean you get lesser or worse service if you happen to be among the people who earn less (ergo pay less into the system). It's exactly the same. Again, hence why it's labeled as one of the four pillars as german *social* insurance.\n\nAnd most importantly :\n\nIt includes EVERYTHING.\n\n(Excluding dentures and spectacles, but even for that they pay up to 30% support)\n\nThere are private health insurances that provide better and more exclusice services, like MUCH faster specialist appointments, and yes these are much more expensive.\n\nBut rest assured, no one in germany, and I mean NO ONE, will ever be presented with a 80k+ hospital bill or some shit like that, whatever the circumstances. That's just not part of our system.\n\n...\n\nPlease ... USA.\n\nWhy is this so hard for you ?\n\nAll americans would be better off."

        "description": "MSNBC has come under fire for their media coverage , (or lack of) over Democratic candidate Andrew Yang, who is currently polling in 6th place, at about 5%. There are accusations of MSNBC attempting to suppress Yang by omitting him from articles and graphics. This has led to Yang's supporters mobilizing on Twitter to post examples of the suppression under the hashtag #YangMediaBlackout.\n\nThe main image circulating around was a picture captioned '10 Candidates On Debate Stage' that listed 9 candidates, the only one missing being Yang. Yang himself called out NBC and the senior producer of NBC News Michael Hopper responded, [claiming that the screenshots had been doctored](https://twitter.com/mhopp7/status/1169819465095139328). He later retracted his statement and admitted he was wrong. Yang then began posting images of various other ways NBC had excluded him.\n\nHopper didn't address the other examples that were provided, but here are a few.\n\n [The NBC website does not list Yang as a candidate.](https://www.nbcnews.com/2020candidates) They list multiple lower-polling candidates on their page however. \n\n[A thread of 3 MSNBC poll rankings](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1169817319146606592) that were all missing Yang, despite him polling high enough to be on them\n\n[A picturing of 'all candidates that have appeared in this year's debates'](https://twitter.com/scottsantens/status/1142442971922653184), also excluding Yang, who had been in the debates\n\nFinally, a [YouTube compilation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UopoNZgWtew&ab_channel=SkinnyDadbod) with various MSNBC news anchors seemingly deliberately, avoiding discussing Yang."

Their effect is to increase support for impeachment, separate and apart from the specific grounds being investigated by the House of Representatives."

My beliefs are pretty mix and right now I highly dislike both democrats and republicans.  I have my own beliefs but sometimes I feel there are reasons I should vote beyond myself. But now I feel as if both are equal evils. \n\nI\u2019m fiscally republican and I believe in less government control. However I\u2019m in a left/ sadly far left state.  Im idealistic left leaning but they have to fit within some reasonable grounded beliefs.  It\u2019s become your either with us or against us mentality. Its insane.\n\nThe only reason I\u2019d vote for trump is his gun stance is more lax. He wouldn\u2019t want to take away our guns. But I sincerely want someone else to be president but him.\nThe left is a reasonable response to try to replace trump.  But I feel no matter what I do, my vote contribute to further dividing the country instead of trying to unite it. \n\nIn my subjective opinion I feel the left is out to control everything we do in our lives while the right is out for numero uno."

His previous debate performances have seen him trying to take bits of his stump speech and shape them to the question. He seemed out of his depth. But then last night... he brought up issues that *really* need to be addressed *yesterday*. Our government is too slow reacting to technological developments (including, but not limited to, automation). Yang's use of the idea of the '4th Industrial Revolution' and the automation of services, his concerns about AI are very current, and will dominate this century - and he is right that we are REALLY slow to catch onto this. He was smart, on his game and really helped shape a picture of the problem. Perhaps he's destined to Bern - start a movement that he will never truly lead. \n\nSo Yang, keep running and bringing these issues up. Make other candidates learn about them (as Warren apparently has begun doing, with Yang's assistance). Make them talk about them. Make voters care about them.\n\nYou're a great issue candidate - you won't win, you can't really - but your concerns are too big to be ignored."

        "description": "Why are the democratic parties so spaced out? I mean from Iowa in Febuary to the last states in June. It seems to give unfair advantage to the people in the first states. I mean if most people vote for Candidate A in State 1 then surely people in State 2 will feel less confident in Cadidate B thus resulting in one states votes effecting another. Surely this seems like a broken system. If we can all vote for the President on the same day why can't we vote for the nominee?\n\nI don't know too much about the delegate system but I do know for instance all of the counties of West Virginia voted for Sanders in 2016, then the state declared for Clinton. Why do we even have delegates if it means popular vote doesn't count once again? Do some states have more power than others here as in the electoral college? I saw \" superdelegates will no longer have the right to cast decisive votes at the convention's first ballot for the presidential nomination \" was this a step taken to reduce something like Clinton happening again? What else has changed since 2016.\n\nI'm excited for new nominees but I don't see the point in the campaign trail if the DNC can just choose their own seemingly unfairly as they did in 2016.\n\nI'm here to get educated, any info/articles, etc. is great thanks"

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "For oligarchs and those striving to become oligarchs, tax avoidance and other overt methods to rig the system is the small tip of a giant iceberg crashing into our society.  I've stayed within the mansions of the elite while working on long-term projects.  Behind closed doors I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand what most Americans haven\u2019t seen.\n\nThis is my story \u2014 and a warning.\n\nI've been a Fortune 500 and small business consultant for decades. Over the years I've worked with Capital One (and their multi-national financiers) among other large corporate names you may have heard of \u2014 and other assorted businesses all the way down to small restaurants in various states across the country.  Within that context I've spent personal time behind closed doors with some of the wealthiest business leaders in this nation \u2014 along with mom-and-pop shopkeepers and founders of nascent startups.\n\nWhat average Americans rarely hear about is the reality that billionaires and hundred-millionaires become excessively wealthy not by outright avoiding taxes, but by very profitably dumping their own toxic and extremely costly business externalities onto everyone else.  The rest of society pays for these externalities with lost lives, diminished health and curtailed opportunities along with a tremendous amount of personal money.  These externalities vary widely.  Some of these externalities are the costs of pollution and the widespread negative effects of low wages \u2014 and some are from the toxic effects of corrupting and diminishing useful government that\u2019s supposed to work for average Americans.\n\nTo maintain this massive grift, oligarchs and their well-paid lackeys bribe public officials and operate corporate media to look the other way as they fleece society to amass gargantuan wealth and power.\n\nI sum this dynamic up here:  [https://i.imgur.com/I95wTfl.gif](https://i.imgur.com/I95wTfl.gif) \n\nIf these oligarchs payed for their own business externalities, they'd be forced to innovate and compete instead of using their oligopolies, bribes, family money and other toxic, monolithic powers to crush competition.  The competition they're killing in this process is small businesses whose decentralized nature is not only the largest driver of job growth in our country, but also the life-blood for a decentralized power structure much less prone to destructive corporatism and fascism.\n\nIf the elite want a thriving small business to become unsustainable they simply buy the government and smother it to death.  I\u2019ve witnessed this firsthand and its effects are terrible.\n\nThriving small businesses are healthy for our nation and democracy, but they are being systematically destroyed.  Local, state and national government officials are actively being bribed and pressured to crush and subjugate average Americans who own small businesses or rely on them for products and services.  If the corrupt elite want a small business or even an entire business park or community to crumble for any reason, they can and will bribe corrupt government officials to double or even triple their property taxes to run them out of business.  They're doing this right now as I write this \u2014 among many other corrupt tactics.\n\nAmazon attacks small businesses across our country by pushing corrupt county and state government officials to regressively tax small businesses.  For example, if you have a small business that ships products from a warehouse statewide and/or nationwide, Amazon will bribe and pressure local government officials to draft and implement purposefully complex tax regulations that require tremendously expensive systems and processes to operate.  This isn't sustainable for small businesses and they collapse.\n\nAmazon and large corporations such as Walmart march in to fill the void they created by using corrupt proxies to destroy small businesses.  Of course, they also eventually raise prices on consumers after the healthy competition is decimated.  As a result, the entire community suffers without proper competition while corporations propped up with government bribes can survive and thrive even with poor leadership and costly sloth.  That\u2019s how so many of these corporations run at a loss.  It\u2019s the corruption keeping them afloat.\n\nDon\u2019t expect the Washington Post who is owned by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos to cover this story.  The corporate media is paid and operated to water down this reality \u2014 or hide it entirely.  The corporate media is also downplaying the urgency of climate disaster that\u2019s vastly worse than scientists first predicted.  This isn't sustainable for our society, but these sociopaths couldn't care less because they are sick megalomaniacs.\n\n\u2022 These are the same people that fight against a living wage.\n\n\u2022 These are the same people that fight against Bernie's Medicare For All.\n\n\u2022 These are the same people that fund your Republicans and most Corporate Democrats.\n\n\u2022 These are the same people that have done nothing to counter humanity-destroying climate disaster and outright worked to stall any action against it whatsoever.\n\n\u2022 These are some of the same people that associated with Epstein who brazenly trafficked and sexually exploited children worldwide.\n\nThese people are evil.\n\nOligarchs and their lackeys do not want to work within an environment where there\u2019s a level playing field among average Americans who have vastly more talent, potential and valuable hard-knock life experiences.  They do not want to compete with other Americans who have the business acumen capable of ethical business practices including paying employees a living wage while running a thriving business.  They want the system rigged in their favor so they can soak society for enormous profits while they wallow in sloth.\n\nThis is why we so often see silver-spooned, out-of-touch, unqualified brats get propped up as titans of corporations.  They often start from a foundation of family wealth then rocket to the top via corruption and a severe lack of ethical business practices that go unchecked via crony capitalism.  They do this instead of the hard work and self-sacrifice necessary to run a business without the exploitation of workers and society at large.\n\nMost of these despicable trustafarians simply could not survive in anything resembling a truly competitive, properly regulated market filled with talented people of all walks of life.  They can\u2019t compete in a truly competitive market and wouldn\u2019t know how to adapt if they were forced to do so. Their family legacies of nepotism and mass exploitation would crumble under the weight of true competition.\n\nAs I mentioned in the first paragraph, I've met with many of these people behind closed doors.  I know their public positions and I know some of the disgusting private positions they hold.  I've witnessed first-hand their sociopathy, sloth and outrageous greed at the expense of others.\n\nI\u2019ve personally heard some of these elite cretins express they are absolutely terrified of Bernie's grassroots movement \u2014 while most of them are only pretending to be afraid of Warren.  They play along with the corporate media charade in hopes that Warren will be thrust into place to continue the profitable cycle of Corporate Democrats blaming Republicans for their own actions and inactions \u2014 while the corrupt status-quo continues mostly unabated.\n\nElizabeth Warren is a trojan horse for the corrupt elite.  Watch what she says and does very closely.  We are running out of time globally and nationally to take real action against corruption that\u2019s poisoning our society and world.  Bernie Sanders is our last shot before this unsustainable society collapses into chaos.\n\nSociopaths couldn\u2019t care less.  It is up to you and me to turn this around.  Fight like hell for Bernie as if the lives of your loved ones depend upon it.\n\nBecause they do.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nedit: changed comma to period."

        "description": "President Zelensky: I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost. ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\n\n\nThe President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.\n*   *   *\n\n\nThe President: . . .I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it.\n\n\nPresident Zelensky: I wanted to tell you about the prosecutor. First of all, I understand and I'm knowledgeable about the situation. Since we have won the absolute majority in our Parliament, the next prosecutor general will be 100% my person, my candidate, who will be approved, by the parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September. He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue\u2026.\n\n\nThe President: Well . . . I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I'm sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything.\n\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2019/09/25/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-transcript-call/index.html"

It is a NATIONAL SECURITY RISK for them to hold multiple citizenships, because of this sitatuation creating mixed loyalties.\n\nIf POTUS does nothing, then what we have is a controversy of Inequality and it's a violation of the Constitution' equal protection clause.\n\nWe the people demand to be treated Equally Under the Law, and by allowing \"some people\" to have dual (or multiple) citizenship, but disallowing \"natural born\" US Citizens to hold multiple citizenships precludes / excludes them from that right\n\nIt is not fair, and more than that, it's wishywashy it's counter to our American Values, it's a National Security risk, it's anti-Constitutional and creates a \"Privileged class\" of people in America (people having more rights / entitlements), with no legal recourse to those without, to rectify.\n\nPlease Consider Either:\n\nA) Immediately CANCEL any dual citizens' US Citizenship or Offer them US Citizenship Only in an agreement to cancel ALL their Foreign Citizenships and give them no more than 3 months to prove they have relinquished their citizenship\n\n--or--\n\nB) Create an Executive order Allowing Every natural-born US Citizen to hold dual or multiple (more than 2) citizenships. This means that America is not a country, and its a huge security risk, and a dumb move. But it's fair.\n\nPlease do one or the other, since you cannot do both, and you ought not do neither.\n\nThank you.\n\nI DO realize that citizenship is thru the State Dept, but I do NOT Trust Pompeo and do not think he is a competent civil servant otherwise he'd have drained his sector of the swamp, and done these things himself already.\n\nThanks again\n\n**Re-post.**"

Or what kind of jobs ( with proof) that he actually created, etc...    \n\nOr if i should do my own investigation how and where should i go about to search for this stuff?    \n\nP.s. this will be used for Thanksgiving discussion and debate tomorrow. :).   \n\nUpdate: no real change but he said he will do some more reading about trump...

        "description": "Let's travel to an alternate Earth with a different Barack Obama for a moment and follow a series of events here.  Obama is elected in 2008, as he was here.  With one difference.  He's convinced 9/11 had nothing to do with Muslims and Al Qaeda.  It was, in fact, an Israeli counter-intelligence operation that caused the terror attacks.  Now, the entirety of our intelligence apparatus says differently.  It states exactly what happened and what went wrong.  Obama disregards that and cancels most, if not all of the defensive apparatuses that were put in place to protect us.\n\nAnd then, if all of that wasn't bad enough, he continuously tries to get rid of the sanctions on Iran stating that they too are victims of an Israeli intelligence operation.  He holds a press conference in Vienna standing next to Supreme Leader Khamenei and completely agrees with anti-zionist rhetoric the man spews.  He even defers to the man during the press conference.  The two then go in the back and hold an hour long conversation to which there are no records of what was said.\n\nNow, conservatives.  Could you please explain to me why you'd be fine with Obama doing all of this as there is zero difference between the scenario above and what our President is actually doing right now?  Please explain to me how this works because, try as I might, I cannot understand what you all are looking at.  Especially those of you old enough to remember the Cold War.  This isn't me railing against you.  This isn't me trying to do some kind of sick burn.  I honestly see absolutely no difference in the above scenario and Trump with Russia.  Help me understand what you're looking at.  Because I don't get it.  Explain to me how you all believe an ex-KGB Colonel over our own people.\n\n\\*end note\\*  I'd honestly prefer nobody come in and start singing with the choir.  I don't want people who aren't conservatives to come in and to tell me what they think conservatives are thinking.  There are many questions revolving around Trump, but this is the one that befuddles me the most.  The one that makes me sad for this country the most.  The rest of it is typical political shenanigans and corruption.  I get that.  But this?  I'm drawing a blank on it.  And if you guys want Trump to be reelected?  It's the one you need an answer to."

        "description": "Please read this before responding. I will try make this as short and concise as possible. (FYI I'm worth about 20k). Reasons:\n\n- Taxing someone for just having money just seems wrong to me. It's taking something from a citizen just because they have it. There should only be a tax when money changes hands.\n- Why not just eliminate many of the tax loopholes that the wealthy utilize?\n- It would be a quandary to implement. Some things will be very very hard to value (unique items like heirlooms, art, antiques, etc.). You would have to depreciate assets constantly. The cost burden of implementing this might not make it even feasible. Even if you did not count unique items (for good reason), it would just drive up the value of unique items like antiques and art because people would start seeing these items as better, tax free investments.\n- The French tried this a very long time ago and it did not work. I believe it was implemented in 2007 and rescinded in 2017.\n- There are many better and straightforward ways to get a tax system that does not favor the rich (like revising capital gains to instead treat all income as income). Adding this wealth tax is just a tax system that would favor accountants and tax attorneys."

So sad to see the many politicians selling their integrity  in  support of a wannabe king for potential votes.   People are busy but how can almost 50% of Americans  be so undiscerning with the information they receive that they don't bother searching for the other truth.     One positive aspect of this shit show - it reminds other democratic countries that they can't sleep at the wheel because we all have people like Trump and his minions  lying in wake to erupt.    Nobody could imagine in their wildest dream a scenario like today's American politics as a movie project  (it would be called over the top , unrealistic) - yet it's real for Americans every day.     I wonder how long this post will stay up."

        "description": "I had been thinking about the issue of partisan impeachment\u2019s, like the one we have just experienced, and how a simple majority may not be the best method. \n\nWould there be a disadvantage of requiring one vote over the majority\u2019s total? This would mean, I\u2019d the house was split evenly (217-217), then the vote to pass would still be 218, but if the majority has say 220 seats, then the vote total for impeachment would be 221. \n\nAll this would mean would be that one whole party, and at least ONE person outside of that party agrees on the topic, regardless of its an independent, or else. Can anyone think of a downside?"

        "description": "It has recently come out that Trump's threats to remove US military from South Korea and Japan without 4 - 10x the agreed upon payments for protection (which we forced Japan to constitutionalize, by the way) were only the beginning. Of course, the drawdown in Afghanistan was expected - and 2/3rds of forces leaving is staggering. 1/2 of US troops in Iraq being removed while we move the few troops stopping Russian, Turkish, Syrian massacres of Kurds to protect oil fields in Saudi Arabia...\n\nAnd then, only a couple days ago, the broader plan surfaced from the Pentagon involving not only the numbers above, but a Phase 1 which will remove most or all US troops in West Africa - including Burkina Faso. Then, within a couple days, Jihadists attack a women's shelter killing 32 women and 3 men. \n\nHow connected is this? What does this suggest for the broader drawdown - what repercussions will it create in countries where the presence of US troops, **even symbolically,** staved off Russian, Chinese and other foreign interference. And staved off terrorist attacks? \n\n(By the way, it has also leaked (?) that Phase II is the removal of US troops in South America - despite our attacks on Maduro of Venezuela).\n\nThe Chinese have built large ports, fast rail, highways - and maintained ownership of them all - while also building naval bases and land bases *run by the People's Liberation Army* \\- in 4 African countries, Sri Lanka, and several other countries while their development projects and products can be found everywhere in Ecuador, Colombia, Eastern Africa, parts of South and - increasingly - Southeast Asia...\n\nIs this a sign of what's to come? Or just a random attack that will not change from current patterns? Will it be a global effect? How much are Russia and China intervening as we leave - hint: a lot)?"

I've noticed some of the reservations in my area are dangerously close to \"dying\" for lack of a better term. Some of these reservations had less than 1000 people living on them during the last census and population has only declined since. My question is, if down the road all registered tribal members die off, according to federal law, what would happen the that land? The land has exclusively been set aside for specific first nations citizens and if that nations legally registered population ceased to exist what would become of said land?"
