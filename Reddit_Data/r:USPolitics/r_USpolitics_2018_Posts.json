I would like to debate whether or not this would be beneficial for world peace.\nThis man has consistently (unlike other war hawks) advocated pro war positions in every single case.\n\nFrom Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Iran, North Korea, China, Ukraine, Serbia. Every Single Time. I think he was against the Cuban embassy, against peace with FARC and has spoken for intervention in Venezuela too. \n\nThere are hawks like McCain but they are \"reasonable\" hawks with clear principles that guide them. You can fault these people. But Graham is a unique case.\n\nIf I were to be conspiratorial I would say that he would support war whether or not he was being payed by a lobby or whether or not he had any principles. \n\nI think that the person may be a manical psycopath intent on seeing the world destroyed or at best that he literally gets off by being hard on a CNN or Fox News interview on absolutely everything. \n\nI also bet he has a small dick.\n\nThis is a serious post, please don't mind the absurd nature of it.\n\nHas he ever been for peace? Ever? "

        "description": "Just heard this while watching the news, with all the protests in the U.K., this seems like an odd move. The anchor \u2014 Kate Bolduan \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem know what\u2019s going on.\n\nPerhaps the conference is re Wednesday\u2019s news that Rosenstein is going to ask [prosecutors assist in the Kavanaugh document review](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/11/politics/brett-kavanaugh-rod-rosenstein-documents/index.html)?\n\n**Update**: CNN just reported that the conference starts at 11:45 a.m. ET, with Manu Raju, a popular CNN investigative reporter, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1017772211699109888?s=21) that even he isn\u2019t aware of what the conference is going to produce, however, he placed an interesting anaxdote in one of his [tweets](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1017790604405854208?s=21), indicating that the Russia investigation has produced 79 criminal charges. This will be very interesting. (Another user said that Rosenstein has only ever announced a press conference when he\u2019s announced indictments, otherwise, he\u2019s known to include some details, which today\u2019s announcement lacks.)"

        "description": "So like many Americans today I am a bit ...upset. While reading on other political forums / sites, the overwhelming opinion of those outside America is \"This is the time to riot/protest/loseyourshit\". But what I think many outside America don't realize is there are at least 2 major reasons we can't just \"all show up in DC\".\n\n1.  America is freekin' huge (US map overlayed on Europe) We can't just all fly in for an afternoon protest. For me personally, this would be roughly equivalent to flying from Rome to Syria (on that particular overlay map)\n\n2.  For many of our citizens, taking off work to protest would lose them their job. This would have a cascade effect where their entire life could be ruined. They'd lose health care, homes, retirement security, etc. We just don't have the same worker protections others do. It's absurd, but there you have it.\n\nSo, what I want to ask is, how can we organize something we can ALL do? My idea would be something like a \"no-shop\" protest. Everyone buying the bare minimum of necessities for as long as possible. Just the basics: food, essential hygiene, medications. No starbucks. No clothes. No gadgets. We can all do that from where we are. And if we all do it while wearing some sort of unifying pin/placard whatever, it could unify the masses.\n\nBut ...How? How do we do this? How does this shit get going? Because we have GOT TO DO SOMETHING!"

The burglar did not break in to do good, even though that was the outcome. And Putin committed an attack on the US.\n\nBut if as a result of that attack, a Domestic enemy was exposed that did trickery during the primary AND the DNC did nothing at all to address the situation, why would any sane patriotic American vote in a Democrat, over Russia doing what a patriotic whistleblower within the DNC should have done. More than a handful of persons from within surely knew about the situation, yet it took a foreign hack to expose it all. What does that say about the DNC? "

        "description": "Weirdly enough this sentence here which isn't connected to anything else is the last time I will mention Trump.\n\nI think America is really broken, like excluding current politics this goes back long before 2016.\nI think it is abysmal how divided America is, again even before current events, both in economical terms and social status. Most of the money comes from the south from the oil and film business largely produced in southern states like California and Texas while the northern states generally seem economically deprived. But more than that there's snobbery, it's really not fair how both sides treat each other, the hypocrisy from everyone sickens me. I'm surprised there wasn't a second civil. And while I know the agricultural industry brings in a lot of money from food productions and I'm not an expert on economic or social studies but I'm just saying it is ridiculous how a supposedly stable country is and has been splitting at the seams for decades.\n\nAnd people act surprised by the current presidency but this has been building for years and decades.\n\nAnother thing is the way America has fallen behind other countries. It is ridiculous that a tiny island off the coast of mainland Europe and Canada beat America to a national health care system. I know it's a clich\u00e9 for the British to be emotionally dulled and stiff upper lip etc but America just gives off vibes of just complete apathy towards its own citizens. In a way it reminds me of North Korea, again ignoring Trump, this lack of care is ridiculous.\n\nTo finish I need to say this. I don't hate America, America was never the greatest country on earth but what has happened to this land of ideals, second chsnces and a better life in the last couple decades. (Again just so everyone is 100% clear I don't like Trump but this is far bigger then him, I blame him but I blame Obama, I blame Clinton, I blame Reagan. All of them have failed America by simply not addressing the divided nature of the country and or implementing social and economic reforms to ultimately make a stronger American union)"

        "description": "Hey All,\n\nI'm 22, recent Biomedical Engineering graduate from an East Coast University. Always been a bit of history & politics buff, and now I'm feeling a bit concerned. Frankly terrified, really, and I'm not sure if I should be or if I'm overreacting.\nCould be a bit of both. Haven't had any real world experience to be honest.\n\nTrump is the President. That's not new - that's normal. This is what terrifies me. We, as a country, elected him (not interested in debating the election; he's the President and he won't be removed from office because of precedent). He has no military, no legal, no executive experience. We have normalized him and his leadership, as well as his attacks on the mainstream media. Every passing day, we normalize Trump, and we don't tackle issues which are festering and might really lead to some serious issues in american society.\n\nI'm not trying to be a fear-inducer. What I'm saying is that locally small, incremental changes in normalization can lead to a relatively abnornal state being considered normal. 'Crashes' or 'catastrophes' are rarely freak accidents or isolates incidents. They tend to be the symptoms of some long process which grows sort of 'unchecked'. \n\nListen to Noah Chomsky, about how the white working class is bearing the brunt of gun-related suicides and opioid & alcohol addiction. These citizens likely elected Trump in the hopes of job security. The President doesn't seem to be doing that. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nWealth inequality is huge right? Automation will be taking away jobs; if self driving is cracked in 10 years, the Trucking and Taxi industries will be in some trouble, although it will probably be phased out. But a lot of 'contract', commodity labor will be automated. Amazon is eating up retail. THEY BOUGHT WHOLE FOODS. \n\nClimate change and global warming are processes we continue to contribute to; and their effects harm EVERYONE. First coastal communities, but also pollution in air leads to chronic disease. \n\nI don't know if these issues are life or death serious now, but why wait for that point? Why are we not tackling issues which affect ALL americans? Mass incarceration via the prison industrial complex not only perpetuates systemic racism, but also incurs disproportionate costs on American poor, who can't pay for them, so the lower middle class ends up paying for them in taxes. Obesity rates boost corporate profits while hurting the health of families and kids, and yet incur a long term recurring cost on society via health care.\n\nWe have an inefficient health system, which is burned by regulation and somehow transaction costs in the form of insurers. Education is very expensive but seemingly low on ROI (some are even scams), especially as Devos has rollbacked protections for student loan forgiveness.\n\nWhat is actually happening? This is the America of Lincoln and FDR? Of Washington, Adams, and Jefferson?\n\nLook, we know the United States isn't perfect. No nation is. But when did we get so obsessed with furthering American intervention abroad that we forget to take care of our problems at home? Honesty, is this the America you want to be proud of being a part of? This is the America you want to fight for, should you be drafted as per your signature to the Selective Service?\n\nI don't have any solutions. I don't agree with violence or dividing American citizens into us vs. them groups. I do agree with the idea of an American dream, the principles of respect, equal opportunity, and individual liberty.\n\nSo let me propose an idea, and you tell me whether you would support it or not. Maybe wr can do a 'social revolution' (no violence though). We are a country of MLK Jr. and Susan B. Anthony. We should try to attack our problems- problems that affect American citizens.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\nAsk the state to provide infrastructure or public work jobs to solve problems which benefit community health. Whoever needs a job gets one at double min wage - make reusable tote bags from recycling matrrials, train EMT services at free walkin community health centers, build minimal housing complexes for the homeless/jobless/working poor. \n\nEveryone wants prosperity. But more importantly everyone wants to be a valued member of their society, country, and community? How do we do that best? By working - and getting paid from the public state - on problems which affect the American public. Would you rather die for your country as a solider or live in it a builder?\n\nWhich America do you and do your kids want to inherit? One where you are responsible and can take pride in your claim to citizenship? Or one where we let a political system mired in distrust  make decisions?\n\nKeith Ellison said \"If you're not at the table, you're on the menu\". So let's make tables. Let's do it through public service which is lasting, sustainable, and DOESN'T LEAVE THE NEXT GENERATION IN A SITUATION WE INHERITED.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

I've tried following various subs like cringe anarchy, r/politics, The_Donald, and political humor, and I've been as close to unbiased as can be, but both sides seem to be very toxic and extreme.  I've been unable to put myself on a side because I tend to agree with things from both sides.  So I'm here with the question, where can I learn about current politics in an unbiased way that, updates on political issues daily, covers issues [mostly] that involve US Politics, and where can I learn about the different political stances and what they are/stand for (liberals, conservatives, libertarians (dunno if that's a political group or whatever, or even spelled right), etc.) in order to form my own opinions?"

        "description": "In the mid-1950's, under Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the top individual marginal rate on the wealthiest Americans was 95%.  And it gradually went down from there.  This provided the government with the revenues necessary for such things as the construction of the interstate highway system, and also helped prevent the income inequality and mass accumulation of wealth that have had such a devastating impact on both the political system and the vast majority of Americans.\n\nDemocrats should propose a restoration of the progressive income tax as it existed under Eisenhower, along the following lines:\n\nRates:\n on taxable income over $10,000,000: 90%;\n on taxable income between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000:\n   70%;\n on taxable income between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000:\n   60%;\n on taxable income between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000:\n   50%;\n on taxable income between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000:\n   45%;\n on taxable income between 500,000 and 1,000,000:\n   40%;\n on taxable income between 250,000 and 500,000: 35%;\n on taxable income between 150,000 and 250,000: 30%;\n on taxable income between 100,000 and 150,000: 25%;\n on taxable income between 80,000 and 100,000: 20%;\n on taxable income between 60,000 and 80,000: 15%;\n on taxable income between 40,000 and 60,000: 10%;\n on taxable income between 30,000 and 40,000: 5%;\n on taxable income under 30,000: 0%.\n\nCorporate tax rate on profits from domestic operations: 35%;\nCorporate tax rate on profits from operations in foreign countries:\n 50%, whether or not the money is brought back to the U.S.\n\nReagan's 1986 Tax bill made corporate profits on operations in foreign countries tax-free, unless and until the corporations decided to repatriate the money, at which time those profits were only taxed at a sharply reduced rate, often less than 10%.\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if corporations are taxed at 35% (or whatever) on profits from domestic operations, but not taxed on profits from operations in foreign countries, the corporations will move their operations to foreign countries to the extent possible.  And that is exactly what happened.  After the 1986 tax bill, there was a mass exodus of corporate operations, and jobs, to foreign countries."

        "description": " \n\nHi,\n\nI was wondering if any progress has been made regarding this topic, policywise. In my country, there were some reports of sexual harassment as well in the audiovisual sector and since then, there's a lot of pressure on our minister of Media and Culture to address sexual harassment. He came up with a 'plan of action', stipulating some proposals. But imo they're very thin: almost all of them are curative, with almost no preventive measures (e.g. instating a contact point for victims, organizing contact moments between victims to share their stories, and all the 'good' measures he takes are on the dime of the sector itself, which is already struggling here to keep the head above water). He defends himself by saying that it is 'very dificult to take preventive measures', which is a load of bullcrap in my opinion. That's just the easy way out.\n\nSo I wonder, have there been any iniatives in the U.S.? If yes, how do they play out? In what way is the legislator trying to prevent this from happening again?"

        "description": "The timing is very suspicious.  The piece was released one day after the Bob Woodward's book was released.  And it has effectively shifted media attention away from Bob Woodward's book.  It has provided Trump with a much weaker enemy to attack--a gutless anonymous source--instead of having to deal with essentially the same information from a very widely respected investigative journalist with a 40-year record of accuracy.  Time and again, we have seen that Trump's standard operating procedure is to distract from adverse publicity about one thing by creating some new controversy, even when that new shiny object on its face is equally bad if not worse.  My guess is that the author of the NYT OpEd worked directly with Trump and his core to schnooker the New York Times, Washington and the American people."

In the episode, the victim who picked him out of a lineup in 2004 swears it was him and is even scared that he would get out of prison. It turns out that the guy sitting in jail, who she was 100% sure was the man who raped her was not the man who raped her, but instead was a lookalike of the actual rapist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mention this because (as Ben Shaprio has been saying) that maybe she actually did have this horrible thing happen to her but it's not Kavanaugh and Judge, it was other people."

It seems like everyone is vehemently split over the nomination of Kavanaugh, and his potential to hold a lifetime seat on the highest court in the land. The thing is though, we(US citizens) don't get to vote on this do we? I'm not advocating for or against him, I have zero concern anything that results from Schroedinger's Appointment will affect the lives of me or my loved ones, but why is everyone up in arms about it? What is the endgame here behind this 'investigation'? I suppose the end game for one side is to get Kav on the SC, and the end game for the other is to getting Kav withdrawn. However even If 100% of the  american people all agree that he is a shitty little perv and is unfit to be on the SCOTUS, does that mean the gov't still won't railroad him through using some obscure bill they pass through at the 11th hour or some bullshit like that? This feels like a big ol' circle jerk. I'm pretty oblivious on account of a TBI so it is totally possible I missed something. So someone please fill me in on why we are wasting our time trying to figure out if some man committed heinous sexual acts when he was kid. I don't mean to make light of the issue since degrading women is a huge fuckin deal. But hear me out. Suppose we get the time machine up and running again and go back to the dates on which the allegations occurred. From there we find out empirically what happened. Do you honestly think reps or dems would flip a 180 on this issue? If the world was normal tomorrow and this whole thing was resolved what would be your best case scenario? No violence please.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: 'a' where it shouldn't be."

Haley is from South Carolina. So is Lindsey Graham. He wants to be Attorney General so bad it has his knickers in a twist. Trump wants to dump Sessions. Graham is probably the easiest confirmation that Trump could get out of the new Senate. Trump fires Sessions, appoints Graham as AG and South Carolina's governor appoints Haley to fill Graham's seat until the next election.\n\nThoughts?"

In the last Canadian general federal election we had 69% voter turnout and with some 57,500 polling stations making the average time to vote 21 minutes.  Plus, I saw a reddit post today from some guy who said the local authorities kept changing his polling station location each election and today he had a 21 mile roundtrip to vote.  My curiosity wants to know why U.S. voters have to spend hours at some locations to vote; is it because of a limited number of polling stations?"

Occasionally, I would troll as a pro-Trumper on social media just for shits and giggles. And whenever I tweet or post something that is pro-Trump, I would get like a dozen follows, 50 likes, and 5 new friend requests, all within hours of the post. Whenever, I post something Pro-Left or Anti-Trump, nothing. The level of enthusiasm and cohesiveness in their side is absolutely unrivaled by the Left. This is just to give you an idea of what it\u2019s like in the other side.\u201d "

I\u2019m taking this list to my next town hall. \n\n\u2022 An elected official shouldn\u2019t be able to take office without making their tax returns fully public for the sake of transparency \n\n\u2022 We shouldn\u2019t allow anonymous campaign donations. Same reason. Transparency. \n\n\u2022 All states should require candidates to make statements indicating where they stand on issues currently on the ballot. These statements should be complied into pamphlets by issue and politician, accompanied by a pie graph of every single company they\u2019ve accepted campaign money from and how they\u2019ve voted on past issues. This information should be made free, streamlined, easily accessible, and standardized. \n\n\u2022People running in elections shouldn\u2019t be able to oversee those same elections!!!!\n\n\u2022 Ballots should be hand counted in front of representatives from both major parties or every party on the ticket. Sure, it takes a while. But, having a bunch of emergency elections seems like it takes way longer. \n\n\u2022Voting should be allowed for the entire month of November. Every state should allow voting by mail and Election Day should be a federal holiday to facilitate voter participation. \n\n\u2022 Felons should be allowed to vote after completing their debt to society nationwide unless they committed a political felony like treason or sedition\n\n\u2022 We shouldn\u2019t elect people on voting machines that can be hacked by foreign entities \n\n\u2022 There should be a nationally standard ballot format\n\n\u2022 No one should be appointed by a party that just massively lost an election during a lame duck session. Or there should at least be restrictions on how many people you\u2019re able to appoint during this time so you can\u2019t just railroad 82 unelected officials into power in one day \n\n\u2022 If your party is guilty of systemic election fraud or voter suppression, there shouldn\u2019t be a \u201cdo over\u201d election. The election should just automatically go to the other guy. Your candidate should be removed from the ticket. Your party should be heavily fined. And someone\u2019s ass should go to federal prison. Period. Also, systemic election fraudsters should be permanently banned from actively participating in American politics even at a local level or as a non-elected political position. \n\n\u2022 SCOTUS appointments should NOT take place during a national election year. It should be illegal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Justices would have 30 year term limits. Every 15 years half of the Justice would be replaced. At this time, each State would provide a single candidate (decided by the state representatives). Then all representatives will choose justices via ranked choice voting (Single transferable vote with Droop quota). If a justice dies before their term ends a temporary replacement is chosen by the president, confirmed by senate. This replacement\u2019s term ends at the next Justice Election Cycle."

I find it rather despicable that in a country that champions free speech, and in a forum that is supposedly \"U.S. politics\" (not liberal politics) that a mere sharing of something unpopular is grounds for being silenced. I thought that the \"progressive\" left were supposed to be for \"equality\", \"individual liberty\", \"freedom of expression\", etc. It's funny how they always claim that anyone who disagrees with them are Nazis, but they are the only ones who active silence opposition. Hmmm...."

After suddenly deciding on the last day that he changed his mind and didnt like the new budget after all, congress didnt manage to scramble back to DC fast enough to present a new one to trump before the government entered partial shutdown.

Trump seems determined to end the year with an exciting finish and the market is chancing to help him. Why can't politics manage to stay boring for a week or two?"

It talks about cartels using customer service to \u201c [deliver just like pizza delivery](https://www.npr.org/2015/05/19/404184355/how-heroin-made-its-way-from-rural-mexico-to-small-town-america).\u201d Drug dealers would prey on the most vulnerable, waiting outside of treatment centers to tempt people on shaky ground early in their recovery back into addiction.\n\nThe claims in the book about the origins of the drugs are supported by the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-opioid-epidemic), which estimates that \u201cmost of the heroin coming into the United States is cultivated on poppy farms in Mexico, with eight cartels controlling production and operating distribution hubs in major U.S. cities.\u201d They also estimate that \u201cmost fentanyl coming into the United States is produced in China, and commonly transited through Mexico.\u201d\n\n[U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/report-nearly-all-998-of-illegal-drugs-shipped-to-us-from-mexico) reported just three years ago that 99.8 percent of methamphetamine seized in the U.S. came through the southern border. Burying our heads in the sand will not solve this urgent problem."

I fully support an open and accessible Internet, which are the principles of net neutrality.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As you may know, in order to enact net neutrality regulations, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to reclassify the Internet under Title II of the Communications Act on February 26, 2015.\u00a0 Unfortunately, Title II goes far beyond requiring net neutrality and subjects Internet service providers (ISPs) to heavy-handed government regulations that threaten to stifle investment and innovation.\u00a0 We need to encourage investment and innovation in the Internet, not discourage it. More investment will help promote competition in the market, and it will help reach the 34 million Americans who still lack quality Internet access.\u00a0 Additionally, 22 of our nation's smallest ISPs said that the costly Title II regulations have slowed, if not halted, the development and deployment of innovative offerings for their customers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As you may be aware, on December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to return to the same Title I framework that regulated the Internet from 1996 to 2015.\u00a0 The order also restored the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) authority to police bad actors, and it requires even greater transparency from ISPs.\u00a0 Further, on December 11, 2017, the FCC and the FTC unveiled a Memorandum of Understanding outlining how the agencies will work together to safeguard the public interest and protect Internet consumers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I support both the principles of net neutrality as well as a regulatory framework that is modern, fair, and does not hinder growth.\u00a0 The FCC's return to Title I gives Congress, the FTC, and the FCC the opportunity to work in a bipartisan, transparent fashion to update our communications policies to ensure the Internet remains open, attracts investment, promotes competition, and drives innovation.\u00a0 As the 115th Congress further examines broadband Internet regulations, please be assured I will keep your views in mind.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again, thank you for contacting me.\u00a0 If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact my office at (202) 224-2551.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Hoeven\u00a0\nUnited States Senator\n\nSenator Hoeven values your input. For further information or to provide another comment, please click\u00a0here. Thank you.\"\n\n.......\n\nThoughts? This is a pretty well explained argument for why he's choosing not to reverse the FCCs decision. But it's just leaving consumers vulnerable. How is a mind with this type of decision made able to be changed? For me, this is frustrating and ultimately disappointing. "

Nixon, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entry; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.\n\nThe means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following:\n\n    making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States;\n\n    withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States;\n\n    approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counselling witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings;\n\n    interfering or endeavouring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and Congressional Committees;\n\n    approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities;\n\n    endeavouring to misuse the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the United States;\n\n    disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability;\n\n    making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the President, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct: or\n\n    endeavouring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony.\n\nIn all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\""

        "description": "**The Senate Bitcoin Hearing**\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee\u2019s [hearing on the oversight of virtual currencies](https://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/2/virtual-currencies-the-oversight-role-of-the-u-s-securities-and-exchange-commission-and-the-u-s-commodity-futures-trading-commission) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Tuesday morning, had some [key takeaways](https://bitrazzi.com/key-takeaways-senate-bitcoin-hearing-sec-cftc-testimonies/) for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, and market participants actively engaged in the purchase, sale, trading, issuance, rating, and / or the regulation of cryptocurrencies. The hearing was called by The Committee on Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs to hear testimonies from the SEC and the CFTC on the opportunities, challenges, and dangers of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, with an intention to aid rising investor concerns about the market.\n\nNotable spokesmen at the hearing included:\n\n* Senate Banking Committee Chair Mike Crapo\n* S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton\n* S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Christopher Giancarlo\n\n**The SEC\u2019s Stance**\n\nThe SEC\u2019s key points, as brought forth by Clayton at the hearing included (but were not limited to):\n\n1. The stance that technological innovation for capital raising should be embrace,d but not at the expense of protecting investors and the markets.\n2. The risks of investing in ICOs and cryptocurrencies are significant because many promoters are not complying with US securities laws, and because investors who put money into them may have their money sent overseas without their knowledge.\n3. The risk of not being able to effectively pursue the overseas cowboys in the products in the current crypto ecosystem\n4. The need for more computer horsepower with the SEC in order to regulate Bitcoin, and for more workers in its Enforcement and Trading and Markets Divisions\n5. 5 issues that the SEC needs to resolve before approving cryptocurrency ETFs are:\n\n* Liquidity\n* Valuation and custody of the funds\u2019 holdings\n* Creation\n* Redemption\n* Arbitrage\n\n**The CFTC\u2019s Stance**\n\nOn the other hand, Giancarlo had the following points to make when speaking on behalf of the CFTC:\n\n1. The current federal system for regulating Bitcoin is a patchwork, not a comprehensive structure\n2. Appropriate federal regulation of cryptocurrencies may include data reporting, capital requirements, cybersecurity standards, measures to prevent fraud and price manipulation and anti-money laundering and \u201cKnow your Customer\u201d protections\n3. \u201cWe must crack down hard on those who abuse our enthusiasm for Bitcoin and blockchain technology\u201d\n\nBoth the SEC and the CFTC agreed that Bitcoin is not a systemic risk now because it is a relatively small market. Together, the two financial regulatory authorities of the U.S. testified to tighter regulation and a more coordinated response between federal agencies, in order to protect investors from fraud and abuse in the cryptocurrency markets. While scams and fraudsters must be cracked down upon, the general market must simultaneously be allowed to develop."

It happened in 1975, when the government had a slim majority in the lower house, and the opposition had control of the Senate. The opposition used the Senate to block supply, which essentially meant the budget passed by the lower house wouldn't go through. This game of brinkmanship essentially ended with the Governor-General sacking the Prime Minister and forcing an election.\n\nThere's obviously a lot more to it than that. For one thing, getting the Prime Minister dismissed was the whole point of the exercise. The Australian and American system also differ in key ways.\n\nBut what confuses me is how in our country, the prospect of a government shutdown happened once, over 50 years ago, and led to the downfall of the government. In the US, it doesn't seem to be that rare, or even *that* much of a big deal. It seems to be just something that happens every few years.\n\nAm I misunderstanding the severity of the shutdown? You'd think that if the government can't agree on what to fund for the next few weeks, then that's a symptom of some very concerning problems."

The same gun used in:\n\n- the Mandalay Bay Vegas shooting\n- the Orlando nightclub shooting\n- the Sandy Hook shooting\n- San Bernardino, Sutherland Springs and more\n\nI\u2019m relatively young, and I grew up with these shootings. I hardly feel them anymore, especially when they have a death toll like 18, which is starting to feel low. But Parkland hit home. These are my generation. These are people like me, my friends, and my siblings. For all I know, I could be next.\n\nI know the drill by now. Politicians will offer thoughts and prayers. People will shrug their arms and brush the killers off as crazy people, hell-bent on obtaining a weapon. And when I arrive at school, just before the pledge of allegiance, my principal will announce a moment of silence for the victims of the shooting in Parkland. But a moment of silence is the last thing that we need. My generation just experienced our Columbine. We need a moment of noise. No, not a moment but a day, a week, a month, or a lifetime of noise. This is when we stop being silent.\n\nThis is the last straw. The teenagers of America have felt the impact of this massacre and we will no longer be quiet. I will be loud, and I will stand up for common-sense gun laws. Because that\u2019s what my country needs. Fuck your silence.\n\nEdit: there are assault weapon bans in certain states"

        "description": "https://archive.is/61cn8\n\nAmerica's ruling class has a curious attitude to democracy. It seems to be interpreted as something that's good for the US and its allies but bad for critters who won't accept their role in the 'America-led international order.'\n\nFirst off, let me be clear. I think all foreign electoral interference is wrong. In any country. And if it's eventually proven that Russians meddled in America's 2016 presidential election, I certainly won't condone it. But I've have always doubted that the Russian state organized some heinous plan to tilt the contest to Donald Trump, so I'll be shocked if something of this nature is ever proven.\n\nInstead, I've always imagined the greatest extent of Russian 'interference' was probably some half-baked playing around by private individuals. Something akin to a \"social media marketing campaign,\" as the New Yorker's Adrian Chan believes. And on a relatively minute scale, to boot. Because - given the billions of dollars swirling around American stumping - anything bar a full-scale FSB/GRU, all-hands-on-deck operation would probably amount to little more than a hill of beans.\n\nBy the same token, I was stunned back in 2011 when the Moscow Times (a pro-US title, overwhelmingly written by Westerners, despite its name) reported how ex-vice president Joe Biden had told fringe Russian opposition figures that \"it would be better for Russia if Putin did not run\" in the 2012 election. Indeed, when you see the opprobrium directed today towards US Green leader Jill Stein for once attending an RT banquet where Putin was present, its shows one hell of a double standard. Distant View\n\nBeing relatively new to Russia in those days, and far from Moscow, it also seemed bizarre when then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a \"full investigation\" of alleged irregularities in 2011's parliamentary elections. And, even more absurd, that she did it in front of Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, at an OSCE meeting attended by 56 countries. Indeed, it seemed like a teacher wagging her finger at an errant student in front of his classmates, and not how you'd interact with the emissary of a powerful country.\n\nAt the time, something interesting happened. Many of my then-relatively new Russian friends had expressed concern about the vote, and a good few supported calls for a fresh ballot. However, once Clinton stuck her oar in, their anger switched to the American; with the attitude quickly transforming into outrage at her arrogance in trying to tell Russians how to manage their internal affairs. Last night, I reminded one of them, Vova, and he said: \"Yeah, what did she think? That we were one of those sh*tty little countries the Americans can just push around?\" This morning, he emailed me joking, \"You know very well, I am not a huge fan of Putin but as soon as Hillary started that nonsense, it smelled to me of the Yeltsin years. I'd rather eat rats than go through that again.\"\n\nAnd this brings us to 1996. Back then, Russia's economy was in serious trouble. American-backed neoliberal economic reforms had reduced ordinary Russians to penury. And Washington turned a blind eye when Yeltsin essentially dismantled the country's nascent democracy in 1993, going so far as to take over the parliament in a tank battle, killing 187 people. He also banned opposition parties and newspapers. Of course, somewhat amazingly, Yeltsin is remembered as a \"democrat\" in the West - which is actually code for \"he defended American interests.\"\n\nAnyway, by the spring of 1996, Yeltsin was in serious bother. The Communist Party, which had combusted in 1991, was back in business, with its new leader, Gennady Zyuganov, well ahead in the polls. And at this point, Uncle Sam got busy, in events which have been widely catalogued and even spawned a Hollywood movie, with the tagline \"electing a Russian president, the American way.\"\n\nAs Thomas Graham, who served as the chief political analyst at the US embassy in Moscow at the time, has admitted, the Americans \"thought it was imperative that Yeltsin win, or that someone like Yeltsin win in June of 1996, in order to continue the reform process.\"\n\n\"This was a classic case of the ends justifying the means, and we did get the result that we wanted,\" he added. Hidden Plot\n\nFurthermore, in case you think the diplomats were on a solo run, Strobe Talbott, the main \"Russia hand\" to Bill Clinton, has detailed the then-president's words at the time. \"I know the Russian people have to pick a president,\" Clinton told his close advisor, \"and I know that means we've got to stop short of giving a nominating speech for the guy. But we've got to go all the way in helping in every other respect.\"\n\nAs Jacobin's Sean Guillory has outlined in a compelling piece (which I have used as a valuable reference here) on the interference, \"The Americans (three consultants hired to assist Yeltsin) were sequestered in Moscow's Presidential Hotel -- the Yeltsin campaign headquarters -- in a suite across the hall from the president's daughter and campaign head, Tatyana Dyanchenko. They assisted in opinion polling; suggested a 'dirty tricks' campaign that would include planting 'truth squads' of hecklers to disrupt Zyuganov's rallies; made Yeltsin's ads slicker and his messages subtler; and urged him to travel around the country, stay on message, and connect with the Russian people.\"\n\nGuillory noted how \"the Yeltsin campaign employ(ing) American consultants is hardly controversial.\" But then pointed out that \"the relay between Richard Dresner (one of the trio) and Clinton's chief strategist Dick Morris, however, crossed the line. In his memoir 'Behind the Oval Office,' Morris notes that Dresner offered to keep him in the loop on the Russian presidential race. With Clinton's approval, Morris received weekly opinion poll briefings that he would share with the president, who would in turn pass on recommendations to Dresner via Morris.\n\nOne can only imagine the outright hysteria if it were discovered today that a Trump advisor, especially one who advocated \"dirty tricks\" against Clinton, had been receiving suggestions from Vladimir Putin. But this is literally what happened in Russia.\n\nTwo years after the Americans had got the result they wanted, Russia defaulted on its debts and ordinary people had their meagre savings wiped out. This isn't forgotten, and is widely blamed on pro-US 'reformers' such as Anatoly Chubais, once described by the the New York Times as \"maybe the most despised man in Russia.\"\n\nDouble Standard\n\nEven today, prominent Americans can't shake their belief that US interference in Russia is legitimate, but any Russian responses are inadmissible.\n\nFor instance, just last weekend, Biden, who has admitted ordering Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to sack his prosecutor general, delivered an absurd speech in Munich. In Germany's southern capital, he suggested sanctions and NATO pressure will make Russians look out of a \"black hole.\" He also declared that Russia's leaders had an \"illegal grip on power\" - which is complete nonsense, no matter your opinion of the Kremlin.\n\nBut Barack Obama's former sidekick didn't even drop the most arrogant statement of the weekend. Instead, that dubious honor belonged to ex-CIA director James Woolsey, who admitted to Fox News that the US \"probably\" meddles in other countries elections.\n\nThe exchange was beyond parody.\n\nFox host Laura Ingraham: \"Okay, but we don't mess with other people's elections right?\"\n\nWoolsey: \"Well huehueyumyumyumyum... but only for a very good cause.\"\n\nAt which point, the pair burst into laughter.\n\nThis topic might have been a joke for the CIA and Fox, but it's not a laughing matter for victims of American intervention around the world. And US-establishment hysteria over alleged (and clearly minor and haphazard and perfunctory, if it existed at all) Russian meddlesomeness in 2016 betrays one key fact: America's elite thinks it has a divine right to control the world and these guys are unable to adjust to the new reality where the US no longer enjoys the status of sole hegemon. And this makes the world a very dangerous place right now.\n\nhttps://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/pol/d/americas-elite-thinks-it-has/6504468930.html\n"

        "description": "In an effort to eliminate the outsized influence of special interest groups, I propose to the reddit community the following philosophy ... candidates for public office can only accept campaign donations from their potential constituents who are eligible to vote for them.\n\nSuch as philosophy has the following benefits:\n- It eliminates all special interest groups equally. Someone running for any elected office cannot accept donations from the AFL-CIO, NEA, NRA, GE, etc. Even the party funds would be eliminated, making the candidate beholden to their constituents, not the party.\n\n- It eliminates all out of territory influence. For example, someone running for a Senate seat cannot accept out of state money.\n\n- It does not restrict the \"free speech\" of any organization, the restrictions are on the candidate.\n\n- It makes the elected official financially beholden to their direct constituents, the way it should be. \n\n- It scales automatically. A congressional candidate could only accept donations from eligible voters within their district, a senatorial candidate from their state, and presidential candidate from the country.\n\nI'm sure there are far more details that would need to be resolved, but the beauty is in the simplicity and intent.\n\nFeel free to share as you see fit. Thanks for listening"

While the Constitution gives the \nPresident authority to negotiate international agreements, it assigns him no specific power over international commerce and trade.  Through legislation, however, Congress may delegate some of its power to the President, such as the power to modify tariffs under certain circumstances.  Thus, because the President does not possess express constitutional authority to modify tariffs, he must find authority for tariff-related action in statute.\n\nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44707.pdf"

Also, kids protesting gun violence and gun reform should be sent to detention for cutting class.\n\nI say the above not because of some draconian, implacable ruling on truancy in the classroom, but to be taught an extracurricular lesson: You\u2019re fighting for a cause that right now is anti-establishment and it ought to come at a price. If you chose to be political active, to be an activist, it\u2019s important that kids learn right now that activism isn\u2019t free and that it may carry a cost.\n\nIn a simulation of this on a small scale, teacher\u2019s would be in the right issuing detention (a small price to pay) to students who skip class regardless of how good or how right their message is. Marchers of the Civil Rights movement, protestors of the Vietnam War, petitioners for better working conditions all fought uphill battles against establishment politics and practices and sacrificed, in some cases greatly.\n\nEven better would be to take the classroom detention time and teach a history lesson on how to operate within a political system to affect change. Or a wider, more broadly lead group-discussion on being civically active.\n\nAgree/Disagree?"

Skipping the obvious question of how she got there in the first place (because the answer is even more obvious, she paid her way in), what truly strikes me is the inability of US senators to launch or initiate an evaluation process on DeVos' competence and skills. It's unapologetically shameful to see such a clueless individual having such prestigious and vital position. I'm not aware of the senate's regulations nor rules but i am hoping that there might be some using reddit and reading us politics. "

Then everything became obvious.\n\nMake touching a weapon or ammo illegal for minors.  \n\nMake viewing a movie depicting weapons illegal for minors.\n\nMake possession of a video game depicting weapons illegal for minors as well as selling these video games to minors.\n\nRequire that any minor who talks about, draws, writes about etc. guns to be detained for up to a month so they can be properly evaluated by psychological professionals.\n\nMinors living in households with weapons should probably be put up for adoption or perhaps they could be locked out of the house for their safety but allowed to live in a trailer or tent in the back yard.\n\nAll schools must be surrounded by a large chain link fence with barb wire and entrances should have a metal detector. \n\nMinors should not be allowed to possess any objects that look like weapons such as pellet guns, air soft guns etc. since some have been shot by police for brandishing them like real fire arms.\n\nAny violation should have mandatory probation of at least a year and further violations should be subject to harsh prison sentences. \n\nI think this policy would reduce if not eliminate school shootings.\n\nIt's time we realized that childrens brains are not fully formed, they are incapable of making rational decisions and they are quite dangerous.  We must place limits on their activity for their own safety and keep them away from dangerous things until such time as they are properly able to think for themselves. \n\nIt's time we clamped down for their own good and adopted a zero tolerance policy when it comes to minors and guns."

        "description": "Hey guys, since there isn't a sub called r/amitotallyignorant I am posting this here on a break from writing a paper on some Mauryan King and Buddhism\u2014a ridiculous topic that will never serve me in life, unless to impress a wealthy Indian man, I guess... \n\nANYWAY, I've been thinking about the case of Donald Trump lately and why maybe it makes sense that he was elected. \n\nI speak Italian and French and I listen to some European current events podcasts, and I notice that they talk about China a lot in a way that isn't really done in North America, with a sort of reverence, kind of like let's keep an eye on China because they're coming up in every way.\n\nThrough this listening, I've gathered that following the 2008 economic downturn, China took a really big hit, and for that reason Beijing has been trying to invest in innovation and they're succeeding, especially with internet companies and AI technology. This is also why, I think, when that senator gave Zuckerberg a \"giveaway\" question, he was VERY careful not to step on Chinese companies' toes because I think he's still in a position to buy/work with Chinese internet companies that are innovating beyond Facebook. But this is not totally relevant.\n\nMy conclusion from all this is that maybe the election of Donald Trump was not a totally stupid move, though it's come too late. One of Donald Trump's main flaws in addition to his potentially illegal election is his rhetoric. America is used to being the cultural leader of the world, but maybe that doesn't matter because it seems to me that America can no longer actually \"afford\" to be that because it's in a potentially precarious situation economically. The country needs a risk taker to flail their arms and salvage a situation that should have been tended to 10\u201315 years ago. (?)\n\nDespite being a Canadian (plot twist), I see a lot of Americans on Facebook complain about Trump, but they're constantly pointing out just his words/his rhetoric and not the economic situation now and not what they're up against for tomorrow. It's as though so many people are used to American \"greatness\" that they take for granted that the scales might be quickly shifting\u2014or slipping.\n\nCan someone further enlighten me on my impressions, or KINDLY set me straight? Please be nice to me in any case. I mean well."

Arming teachers does not make a save learning environment, that is a fact not opinion. \n\nHowever that being said, my solution is to have a few classrooms with locked hidden glass cases perhaps in the teacher desk or cabinet.  Those cases would contain a 6 shot loaded revolver(as they are the most reliable and 6 is not enough to do mass damage in the bad case). In the event of a shooting the case can be broken or unlocked and would trigger an alarm. \n\nUpsides would be immidiate responce time and immidiate full school awareness.\n\nDrawbacks for the solution would be expensive and give easier access to the wrong people.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?  Is this a decent middle ground or are the drawbacks a greater threat?"

I think the whole world is and has been for the last two years but I think today really *really* is a big change.\n\nAs you might know Trump has placed tariffs on European, Mexican and Canadian aluminium and steel imports. This is not a good American decision. In the last month with the China tariffs the price doubled but by this point Trump has cut off every other allied source of metals for the U.S..\n\nIt doesn't matter what your opinion on Trump is, this is an anti American decision. Left or right both ultimately suffer from this as businesses in construction work be forced to pay higher rates for domestic steel as foreign steel could become less and less available.\n\nBasically what this rant is trying to say is that Trump, love him or hate him, has done something that ultimately goes against the job description of the president of America. He has attacked, America.\n\nAmerica I say this not out of hate but love, I love what America can be, what it has done, and what it can do. But this is not helping, anyone. This isn't about politics it's about a basic error in performing the most sacred of actions a president can do. Please I beg you, for your own sake, call your senators make this a thing! Because that's what America does best; it takes something attacking it and makes a fuss, puts up a fight and (if all parties work together) it resolves the matter."
