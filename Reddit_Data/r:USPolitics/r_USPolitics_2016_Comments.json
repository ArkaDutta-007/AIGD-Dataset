        "comment": "I will say, there is a bit of me that thinks there's something of an even-broken-clocks-are-right-sometimes going on with Trump's globalization talk. But less because he's right and more that liberals have a certain weakness to how they talk about it.\n\nCase in point: it is completely incredible to me that there isn't enough of a political movement to socialize the free trade benefits being given to all of us into the communities that are being hurt by free trade. Because make no mistake: the 55-year-olds who are losing their jobs are 100% right that there is nothing in our traditional political discourse that will help them. They're wrong to think that voting for Trump helps them--the die has already been cast, such that the old days are never coming back no matter who's in the White House--but it is also undeniably true that, despite the enormous economic brain power sitting in Hillary Clinton's policy shop, nobody on my side really has an answer for what these people should do now.\n\nThat said, it strikes me that there is a shtickle of personal responsibility missing from their story too. They're looking to protectionism, to mercantilism really, despite having been told for three decades that the developing world was going to one day eat their industry's lunch. Saying \"I'm 55 and my job is going away\" doesn't pack quite the same punch once you admit that you were told it was starting to happen 30 years ago.\n\nStill, these people are Democratic constituents. Dems have been promising job training and haven't been able to deliver, they've been promising a functional welfare system but haven't been able to sell it more broadly--in large part because they somehow keep leaking the support of these very people to a party that sells an even more false comfort: that the economy of the 1970s can return. And it freaks me out that [Trump is acquiring these people left and right](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/coal-country-democrats-donald-trump-2016-213988).",

If that's how it came across, that's my bad.\n\nFirst off, if she went before a jury and judge, they'd come into play in this conversation - but if she's not indicted, their existence or state of corruption/non-corruption is completely unimportant. The fact that the FBI doesn't trust any lawyers or judges to put this in front of seems to be a big enough statement to me.\n\nSecond, it's incredible being an American, and one of the most important aspects of that citizenship is being able to call one's leadership into question without being thrown in prison or beheaded. So that's all I'm doing here. If she or Trump end up being president, I can live with that - but until then, I would prefer that they weren't. Again, that's just my opinion and has no bearing on whether the FBI or Judicial System is capable as a whole.\n\nThird, my biggest cause for concern is rooted in what I believe is an obstruction of justice: to not see this case past investigation. The fact that the rich and powerful are able to subtly break/bend the law with no consequence, especially candidates for the presidency, is hard for me to swallow. It happens all over, and it's just a byproduct of humanity and what happens when humans have power and influence -  but I don't have to like it. \n\nLastly, go Preds.",

It does not matter who pays for the ad campaigns; if it did, I could just point out that the anti-labeling side is funded by the agribusiness industry and every other corporate actor out there.\n\nLabeling hurts GMO sales, which hurts the technology, and this technology has been improving the environment, saving crops, and/or helping people.  \n\nIt is the government's job to only violate freedom of speech, e.g., not being forced to label something, *only* if there is a legitimate public health reason to do so. \"GMO\" is literally meaningless in regards to human safety, nutritional content, and environmental impact.  Because of the public's poor knowledge of GMOs, *made poor by the very same people who are pushing mandatory GMO labeling,* ***which are the very same people who stand to profit from GMO labeling***, GMO labeling would hurt biotech, hurt people, hurt the environment, and enrich the organic industry (which is why they're the ones pushing for it).",

What people want to know with labeliing is: did someone manipulate the dna of this produce my means other than natural cultivation? Did they essentially breed bacteria and viruses with a plant or silence genetic traits or add new ones, all occurrences that could never happen naturally through any hybridization or breeding techniques? Does this product carry a patent that limits biodiversity and makes the farmer beholden to the corporation's contract for x amount of years regardless of failed yields resulting in loss of revenue dollars for themselves and the economy in general?\nAnd you continually respond with: who cares about any of that? Next you'll be asking if they wore purple socks on a tuesday when they packaged it? \n\nI'd say there is a pretty big difference.\n\n>if you haven't committed any crimes, you should have no reason to not want the police/fbi/cia/nsa read your emails and listen to your calls.\n\nYou act as if the government is breaking into mr.

He reminds me a lot of George W. Bush in this way. They're both unexceptional people who never excelled at anything they did (school, business, etc). That's why Trump can't reveal his taxes and true wealth. It'd just make it even more obvious that he'd be far richer today if he'd just kept his money in index funds and never did anything. That's the big problem with presidential nominees like Bush and Trump. They're unexceptional people trying out for the most exceptional job in the world. Hillary's accomplishments, by contrast, are gaudy. Check her bio sometime. By the time she was *thirty* she made 99% of the rest of us look like losers by comparison. If you'd known her at 30 or 40 you'd have thought she was exactly the kind of person who could be president someday. Bush or Trump at 30 or 40? The idea that either would be president one day would, at best, never even occur to you, and more likely seem absurd. Bush was struggling running a small oil exploration company at 40. Trump was developing building projects aimed at the rich and bragging about banging models in TV interviews.",

She is a priliged elite who got off when others would face severe penalties.\n\nI will likely end up voting for Trump as he has less political allies/favors and hence all his brash talk will be for naught.

That said, because she is the establishment, she knows what she's doing.  She can probably accomplish some goals, and we'll have more of the same in Washington.  It's not ideal, but it definitely could be worse. \n\nThe biggest reason I'm voting for Hillary is that in my heart I'm voting against Trump.  I think he's a danger to the country.  First of all, he has no experience as a politician and he's running for the highest office there is.  He has repeatedly made racist comments and blatantly insulted other people.  One of the roles of being president is representing the United States to the world - he would be an embarrassment.  He has advocated war crimes and torture.  He advocated religious tests to enter the United State (for all you people who claim to love the constitution).  He has no plans for the environment, and claims that climate change isn't happening.  Most politicians use vacuous words, but Donald Trump takes it to a new level.  I don't think I've ever heard him use a proper noun.  He always talks about *them, us, here, there*, he says things like \"we don't win anymore\", which is a totally meaningless phrase.  \n\nAnd that's avoiding most of the actual *issues*.  Donald Trump is running for the Republican party, which has incorrect views on everything, from what I can tell. ",

        "comment": ">I view Hillary as enormously qualified to be president of the political system we now have.\n\nA system which has let down the majority of Americans time and time again. If Clinton wins the presidency, I predict America will be stuck with an effective centre-right President with a right-wing Congress. If Trump wins, America will have a dud of a President with likely a left-wing Congress.\n\nIn Trump's scenario part of me wonders how much of what he wants to do will actually get done. I also feel his win would teach the Democrats a hard lesson, that there are many who need change and it seems Democrats will need to be the arbiters of that change.\n\nDuring the Romney-Obama contest the left brought up the term \"more effective evil,\" referring of course to Obama. Obama, as a Democrat had support from the Republicans and Democrats on many issues most Americans don't support. No Republican could ever get that kind of support. However, Clinton, being who she is, I'm not sure she would get the bipartisan support Obama had.\n\nUltimately I have a great sympathy for Bernie supporters, many of whom who were new to the political game, had their hopes smashed upon all of this. Bernie would have pushed the US (and the Democratic Party) in a great direction. I hope that this pressure can continue even after this election.",

You're a lot more naive than I would have ever guessed if you believe otherwise.\n\nSuffering through four years of Trump will be worth it if it means the Progressive movement isn't de-railed by neoliberals like Hillary for the next twenty years.\n\nEither you grossly overestimate Trump's competence, or you really don't see the writing on the wall when it comes to Hillary Clinton.",

Yet it seemed that America\u2019s party of commerce, trade, and pragmatism might still have time to sober up. Remaining engaged in the party implied a contribution to that renaissance, an investment in hope. Donald Trump has put an end to that hope. From his fairy-tale wall to his schoolyard bullying and his flirtation with violent racists, Donald Trump offers America a singular narrative \u2013 a tale of cowards. Fearful people, convinced of our inadequacy, trembling before a world alight with imaginary threats, crave a demagogue. Neither party has ever elevated to this level a more toxic figure, one that calls forth the darkest elements of our national character.",

Its base tenets include such lies as tax cuts on the wealthy create economic growth for all people, global warming does not exist, institutional racism is a myth, there is a \u201cwar\u201d on Christians, white people are oppressed, evolution is just a myth or theory, and America was founded as a \u201cChristian nation.\u201d \nDonald Trump is the perfect leader for a political party where lies are treated as sacred truths. For example, he led the slanderous racist \u201cBirther\u201d campaign against Barack Obama. Trump has also been judged by fact checkers to be one of the most dishonest politicians in recent American political history.",

Last year Kaine voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the modern day sequel to NAFTA which was opposed by workers and unions across the country. Like Clinton herself, Kaine was an opponent of LGBTQ rights for many years, only changing his public stance on gay marriage and adoption rights when it was politically expedient. In 2005 he said that gay couples should not be able to adopt. Presumably, like Obama and Clinton, he experienced a profound personal evolution that just happened to coincide with shifts in public polling. NARAL Pro-Choice America gave Virginia an \u201cF\u201d on abortion rights in 2007 when Kaine was governor of the state.\" https://www.liberationnews.org/clintons-vp-tim-kaine-warmonger-anti-abortion/",

There's no doubt she has her drawbacks; in particular, I am incredibly unhappy with her prior bellicose positions, but she has done so much to better the lives of the underserved and underprivileged that any deficits are equalized in my mind if not completely effaced.\n\nWith every day that passes, more stories of the people Trump has cheated emerge, more allies join the list of those he's alienated, and more minorities in this country are targeted by that bigot as people who aren't truly American and who should be dealt with... somehow. If you're truly worried about your first amendment rights, worry more about him; he's pledged to try to \"open up\" the libel laws, allow churches to preach political ideology, and he's labeled peaceful protesters as almost terrorists.

Until NSA provides evidence, for which their is a precedent when public interest is served by revealing such evidence (it undoubtedly is in this case), I wouldn't take a Clinton aide's word for it.\n\nThat's not to say their isn't a Russia/Trump connection. Certainly, his not revealing tax returns is not helping with the speculation. Still, the fact remains that the content of the emails is damaging to the Clinton campaign, regardless of their provenance.\n\nOr course, DNC and Clinton would much rather the story be about Russian hackers than the fact that the two worked in concert, in violation of DNC bylaws. And, while violating DNC bylaws is not a criminal act, it appears that the DNC may have also been laundering money to take donations meant for down-ticket races and funneling them to the Clinton campaign, in violation of campaign contribution limits, which is a bit more serious.\n\nThe handicapping of Sanders' campaign went beyond simply bemoaning an Independent crashing the  Democratic party in a couple email threads. It's quite clear that the DNC was acting as an arm of the Clinton campaign from the start. One can only imagine what sort of fuckery they were smart enough to not discuss via email.\n\n\nThe worst part of all this is that Sanders always polled better against Trump and with every passing day it's looking more and more like Hillary could blow this thing.

They focused on the use of the term \"money laundering.\"\nIn fact, the use of the term first came from Democratic Party state fundraising sources in the Politico story. \nAs Vogel and Arnsdorf wrote, \"[state fundraisers] worry that participating states\u2026 could see very little return investment from the DNC or Clinton's campaign, and are essentially acting as money laundering conduits for them.\"\n\n2.

Reagan was highly strategic and was \"unpredictable\" more from what he left unsaid.\n\nI just fail to see how goating one of our historical adversaries to get directly involved in a presidential election could do any good.

Trump, not that I am a supporter, has made noise about being more fair in the process of the two-state solution.  Something the Israeli government does not want to hear.

Ironically, Trump laments how little Russia respects us and our leader (Obama)... then later goes on to ask for the emails... as if that is in any way a sign of strength or behavior which is deserving of respect.\n\nJust imagine Obama in 2012, referring to his then-opponent Mitt Romney and saying, in reference to Russia, \"By the way, they hacked. They probably have his 33,000 emails. I hope they do. They probably have his 33,000 emails that he lost and deleted, because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.\"\n\nTrump **HOPES** Russia has Hillary's 33,000 deleted emails.\n\nJust let that sink in for a second when heard in Obama's voice about Mitt Romney, strictly as a simulation. Don't you think a bunch of people would be fucking furious?\n\nLater he says, \"They probably have them. I'd like to have them released.\"\n\nThe reporter asks, \"Does that not give you pause?\" As in, \"Are you fucking serious?\" but in nicer words.\n\nHe responds, \"No. It gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them. We might as well, find...\" then he changes his thought to criticize Hillary.\n\nThen after knocking Hillary for her email incompetence, he adds, \"Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean to be honest with you, I'd love to see 'em.\"\n\nHe does not give any impression that he is joking or being sarcastic. He appears to be quite serious in intent and demeanor.",

You're fine to do whatever you want as long as you're not hurting anyone else or anyone else's property.  \n\nAs far as taxes goes, the problem with them at the NAP is that taxes are collected by force.  You don't have a choice, you must pay taxes or go to jail.  Libertarians would like to see a society where such things are voluntary.\n\nThe concept isn't necessarily a utopia and no realist would expect a purely Libertarian society to emerge.

We were being picketed by animal rights activists and they were distrupting our meeting. I wasn't very happy about that. I thought like they don't - they shouldnt' even be here This is innappropriate. But, I got into a discussion with the activists after the meeting was over. Particularly, this one very tiny but passionate young woman named Lauren Ornelas and we began an email exchange and we were going back and forth because for my attitude back then was \"I don't know why they're picking on us. We're doing more for animals than anybody else. Why aren't they going after Safeway or Kroger, for example?\" And because, as they would say, \"Well, we thought you would actually listen. We didn't think they would.\" And I remember her telling me she said, \n\n>\"John, I can see that you're actually a very idealistic man. You're not like I thought you would be. I didn't think - you're not a typical corporate CEO. But, when it comes to animal welfare and the way animal livestock animals are treated in the United States, you're remarkably ignorant. And\" (gets cut off by interviewer)\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Was she right about that?\n> \n> **Mackey:** Yes.\n\n>(Continues) \"And you shouldn't be because you're running a fairly large corporation and you sort of owe it to all of your customers and employees to know better about these things.\" \n\n>So, I was taken aback and I realized you know she's probably right about that. So that summer, summer of 2003, I read about a dozen books on livestock animals in America. How it evolved, practices. And gah, about midway through after I read four or five books I thought, gah, you know, she's really right. I don't know, I didn't know anything and furthermore we gotta change, gotta do something about it. By the time the summer was over I said, \"I'm not going to eat animals anymore.\" I became a vegan from an ethical standpoint. And then also decided you know Whole Foods needs to do a lot more here. So we invited the activists to work with us as - on our team so to speak - and then bring in animal scientists, bring in the farmers themselves. Bring them together into meetings and let's talk about how we can develop higher animal welfare systems - and so that's how I converted and that's what Whole Foods has been doing ever since.",

He was in the white house for 8 years prior, with another 10 or 15 years in the house/senate before that, so he definitely had the experience.  He's a little old now (68), but that's not extreme (Reagan was just shy of 70, Bush Sr. was mid-60s, many are in their early 60s when they are sworn in).  Dukakis and Mondale are both in their 80s, so I would have reservations about voting for them, depending on their VP choices.  If you're talking about each candidate in their hayday, I'm not familiar enough with Mondale and Dukakis to say, really, but I would think Gore would be a better POTUS pick than Kerry.  Kerry has the international relations experience (and accomplishments, along with the rest of his experience) to do a great job, but I think Gore was more my direction of policy and all.  Gore would also be more likely to beat Trump.",

        "comment": "*Great write up by Vox. Really great. Thanks for this. Those guys at Vox - all those writers - they are a team of winners. They love to win and they know how to win.*\n\nSeriously though, that was a fascinating article. Particularly about how Trump's rambling and tangential style of speech is incoherent when transcribed and virtually impossible to comprehend when read, yet makes sense (in so far as you can figure out what he's getting at) if you watch and listen to him live, due to a more traditional model or oratory and rhetoric and the use of visual cues.\n\nI especially liked the commentary about how in most cases, Trump usually structures his speech according to the rhetorical techniques of salesmen, and by extension, corporate managers and CEOs.\n\nIf you read transcriptions of interviews of C.E.O.s that *haven't* been eagerly polished by editors working in mainstream corporate-owned media, or watch them being interviewed (which rarely happens - thats what their PR team is for), you'll often come across Trump style phrasing that is similarly tangential, lacking in substance, filled with short, punchy sentences, and is fundamentally concerned with selling the product or idea or concept or person at hand by appealing to emotions and fears and desires rather than evidence or fact.\n\nWe live in a post-fact society. As Vox points out, Trump can blatantly lie about something without offering any evidence whatsoever to support his claims, and just by repeating it enough times or making a face or saying \"believe me\" at the end of the statement, a massive chunk of the population will unquestioningly believe what he said.\n\nUnfortunately, virtually every politician or corporate leader or salesperson or broadcaster operates the same way, regardless of political affiliation. Democrats speak in corporate style, PR crafted talking points that appeal to emotions of fear or subconscious motivations just as much as any Republican. They simply might be able to use rhetoric more effectively or more coherently, as in the case of Bill Clinton or Obama, because they were groomed at elite schools and do have rigorously intellectual backgrounds, and additionally because of dynamic speaking styles able to charm millions.\n\nOf course, there are just as many politicians in the Republican party that went to Ivy level schools, and have intellectual backgrounds in law and history and politics and economics. \n\nWhat is key is to realize is that the messages presented by all of these politicians and corporate broadcasters follow the same emotionally-based rhetorical style developed by the Public Relations and Marketing industries, working on behalf of corporations hoping to generate sales of their product by manufacturing wants through appealing to subconcious motivations.\n\nPeople aren't \"sold\" on products or ideas or politicians based on fact - at least not primarily, regardless of how logical and rational people may believe themselves to be. They are \"sold\" things based on fear, desire for sex, and a desire for destruction.\n\nWhile people like to scoff at Freud and say things like \"all of his ideas have been proven wrong,\" that idea is very short-sighted. Just look at the unbelievable success of post Worlf War I capitalism in the United States, and globally. In essence, a system which is fundamentally based on the need to create desires for mass produced products that are essentially unnecessary luxuries, rather than actual necessities of life (though they might still be fun to own).\n\nEdward Bernays adapted the research of his uncle Sigmund Freud and successfully determined how to manipulate the fears, desires, and hopes for happiness of the individual, and of groups, in order to help large corporations determine how to maintain World War I levels of industrial production in a post-war setting, and create markets for their products amongst a newly enriched populace. (This is covered extensively in the BBC documentary series \"The Century of the Self\" on vimeo, and in extensive literature on the subject.)\n\nHis work was so effective that while working for a major tobacco company seeking to expand its market, he was even able to get American women to start smoking cigarettes in the 1920s - which up til that point had been viewed as a distasteful habit reserved for men - by arranging for a group of popular young debutantes and socialites to be seen smoking cigarettes as a sign of women's freedom and liberation while marching a New York City parade.\n\nHis tobacco client was quite pleased that women who saw this display of \"youthful female rebellion\" by the Lauren Conrads and Kim Kardashians of the day promptly fell in line and took up the habit of smoking, as a sign of their own \"empowerment.\" (Amazingly, Bernays gloatingly tells this story himself in the documentary in archive footage, reveling in his ability to grotesquely manipulate a massive sector of the population into a lethal habit purely for the sake of corporate profit).\n\nFrom there, it wasn't much of a leap for corporations, politicians, public relations and marketing industries, and (surprisingly) the predominantly liberal  intellectual elite to seek out a means of applying these techniques to \"manufacture consent\" amongst the civilian population for the policies of an increasingly corporate-dominated political system. Which is a model that has only become more entrenched today.\n\nGood sources to look at include:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self\n\n(Movie Link): https://vimeo.com/10245146\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays?wprov=sfla1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lippmann?wprov=sfla1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing+Consent%3A_Noam_Chomsky_and_the_Media?wprov=sfla1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent?wprov=sfla1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_Illusions?wprov=sfla1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corporation_%28film%29?wprov=sfla1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rebel_Sell?wprov=sfla1\n",

In fact, it was those same Republicans that introduced legislation in the PROMESA act that will lower the PR minimum wage for anyone under 25 years of age to $4.25/hour as well as give the power to veto any legislation by the PR government to raise it to the Oversight Board. \n\nBy the way, more Democrats in Congress approved the PROMESA act than Republicans.  Many Republicans in Congress didn't even want to allow PR to restructure its debt.  Hillary Clinton, who easily won the PR Democratic primary against Sen. Bernie Sanders, supports the PROMESA act while Sanders opposes it.  Sanders instead introduced the Puerto Rico Humanitarian Relief Act, which doesn't establish an Oversight Board or include a $4.25 minimum wage.  But given that Sanders is not very well liked by Democrats and Congress is still controlled by Republicans, it is unlikely to go anywhere.\n\nPuerto Rican's best bet is to move to Florida and help turn Republican red Florida, Democratic Blue.  Elect Puerto Ricans into the US congress and help support statehood.  Once a state, PR will have some say over their own affairs and be subjected to the Federal Minimum Wage instead of Congress's \"Puerto Rican Indentured Servitude Act\".",

They have beaten, tortured, bombed, blockaded and murdered the Palestinian people, unarmed men women children over the last 50 years. From Killing UN personnel and journalists to standing in front of the UN in silence for 40 secs accusing the world of staying quiet while Israel is the victim, its all on the internet.\n\nThe point being made is that whatever the mistake, exaggeration or omissions, these are not our values, not even near, infact they are diagrammatically opposite to what we are suppose to be standing for and supposed to be what we are fighting against.\n\nHow is it then that every aspiring American President starts his/her campaign with the Great American Presidential lie \u201cIsrael our Great Ally\u201d . . .is it proof of their corruption and willingness to put Israel first?\n\nThis is why no one in the world believes a word we say anymore, this huge lie is on our face and part of our history and our personality, well perhaps the British are in with us, but now they have Bozo the clown running things and are up shit creek after we fucked their economy every which way as well as side ways.\n\nWhat percentage of the the voter base does the Jewish vote make? Single digits? Something with zero's in front of it? More than the Hispanic or African American vote . .of course not, no where near\n\nWhy then does every US president have to first bend over and get a public analectomy performed by the Jewish block before he is cleared for us to vote for him?\n\nQuite simple, they control the Banks, the Treasury and the Fed and the economy and whom so ever stands upright shall find his campaign funds wither and dry up, and not to mention a host of other embarrassing problems.\n\nThey are so terrified of them, nobody dares to really refer to them except in code . .they are called the\n\n1% . . .that is what it really means.\n\nSo poppets, when you have two candidates and both of them have had their asshole cleaned by AIPAC, you can rest assured, nothing is going to change, the debt will continue to grow, the same boom and bust cycle will continue, the money will keep getting funneled up the chain and the economy will continue to wither as the money settles with the 1% and the standard of living continues to drop. We have only the illusion of choice.\n\nAs regards to ISIS and Islamic terrorism, nothing will change there either, Al-Qaeda will disappear and ISIS will appear, ISIS will disappear and jingle will appear, Jingle will disappear and Jangle will appear and we will live in a continuous state of despair and fear and never ending flux while our last pennies migrate to meet their mates and we give up all our civil rights. Satanic rituals will be allowed but we have to call Christmas happy holidays\n\n After two taxing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, low intensity conflicts  paid for in limbs, the attrition has sapped the stomach from our armies. They are not what they used to be, where we can invaded and take over a country and fight for uncountable years and neither can the economy sustain it. Airstrikes and drone are one thing, all out is now beyond our means, we did not make peace with Iran for shits and giggles. They just need some fuck wit with a turban and a rocket launcher and we have to mobilize an army. The math just simply does not add up. \n\nIt take 80% of the time to identify the problem and 20% of the time to fix it. When a candidate vetted by AIPAC starts his speech with \u201cIsrael our greatest Ally\u201d to the condescending grins of the 1% as their pet dog on a leash impresses us with his rhetoric . . .I for one know beyond a shadow of a doubt, that that fucking idiot is going to fix nothing, neither the economy, nor the security, neither internal nor external. He simply does not have the wherewithal and all we will have to look forward to is more of the same and at the end of it we will be weaker and less able to fight our way out of it.\n\nThe difference between Pe Pe le Pew and Ole Iron Britches is . . .Pe Pe is fooling himself and thinks he is fooling us and charming AIPAC. . .Iron Britches knows the score and just might have a strategy or at least the first couple of steps leading to one.\n\n\nWhat a couple of million between friends huh?\n\nAnd that is what our world really looks like this day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The reason we should believe Trump did not intend to mock a disabled reporter is \"because he is very smart?\" And his smartness is unquestionable because clearly he knows not to do something in a public forum that will cost him profit?\n\nWow, this is beyond stupid. First of all, horrible logic. \"He's right because he's smart, and he's obviously smart because...\" never quite explained. Second of all, smart people do stupid things all the time; smart people are often smart in certain areas and not so smart in others; even if Trump was smart in the business world, that does not necessarily mean he is smart in the political world. To expand on that last point, his media strategy obviously got him a lot of free press, which works great for business, but when that press is overwhelmingly negative, it works poorly for politics. He did not adapt.\n\nOh, and this paragraph drives me up a freaking wall:\n\n>What is not in doubt is that if the election were to revolve around fundamental policy proposals (what an innovation!), it would be Trump\u2019s to lose. As Patrick Buchanan has observed, \u201con the mega-issue, America\u2019s desire for change, and on specific issues, Trump holds something close to a full house.\u201d\n\nSo Buchanan's comments are somehow proof that Trump would win if the election were actually focused on the issues? Never mind the fact that pools by Pew, Gallup, and scores of others clearly demonstrate levels of support for specific Trump policy proposals, and none of these demonstrate that Trump has anywhere near a \"full house\" on any issue. Here's a [Politico article](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/pew-immigration-wall-227367) from only four days ago citing a recent Pew study: 61% of Americans **oppose** the constructing on Trump's wall. That's just one example, you can Google the rest.\n\nThe press is not unbiased, but this piece is a horrible argument for the idea that Trump will lose \"because of the media.\"",

On any fair assessment, the answer is clearly No.** As the Catholics 4 Trump website has documented, **the media have suppressed vital exonerating evidence.**\n>\n>**The truth is that Trump\u2019s frenetic performance bore no resemblance to the rigid look of arthrogryposis victims.** Pointing out that Kovaleski conducted no on-camera interviews in the immediate wake of the Trump performance, Catholics 4 Trump has commented:\n>\n> >  **Shouldn\u2019t the media have been chomping at the bit to get Kovaleski in front of their cameras to embarrass Trump and prove to the world Trump was clearly mocking his disability? If the media had a legitimate story, that is exactly what they would have done and we all know it.** But the media couldn\u2019t put Kovaleski in front of a camera or they\u2019d have no story\u2026..But, if they showed video of Trump labeled \u201cTrump Mocks Disabled Reporter,\u201d then put up a still shot of Kovaleski, they knew you, the viewer, would assume Kovaleski\u2019s disability must make his arms move without control.\n>\n> According to Catholics 4 Trump, in the same speech in which he presented his Kovaleski cameo, **Trump acted out similar histrionics to portray a flustered U.S. general. Meanwhile, on another occasion, he used the same wildly flapping hand motions to lampoon Ted Cruz\u2019s rationalizations on waterboarding.** Thus as neither the flustered general nor Ted Cruz are known to be physically handicapped, we have little reason to assume that Trump\u2019s Kovaleski routine represented anything other than an admittedly eccentric portrayal of someone prevaricating under political pressure.\n>\n> Perhaps **the ultimate smoking gun in all this is the behavior of the Washington Post. On August 10, it published a particularly one-sided account by Callum Borchers. When someone used the reader comments section to reference the alternative Catholics 4 Trump explanation, the links were deleted almost immediately.** As Catholics 4 Trump pointed out, the Post\u2019s hidden agenda suddenly stood revealed for all to see:\n>\n> >  **This demonstrates that the Washington Post is aware of evidence existing that contradicts their conclusions, and that they are willfully attempting to conceal it from their readers.** If Borchers and WaPo were honest and truly wanted to report ALL of the evidence for and against and let the readers decide, they would have to include the video of Kovaleski and the video of Trump impersonating a flustered General and a flustered Cruz. **Any objective report would include both evidence for and against a certain interpretation of the Trump video.**\n>\n> [...]",

Trump could be detained under internal documents reclassifying hate and domestic terrorist groups.**\n>\n>**This is not a play to the tired conspiracy theories of FEMA Camps, but rather the Department of Justice adding vocal Trump supporters to both hate and domestic terrorist organizations. The internal memos that I have seen consider Trump supporters to Neo-Nazi groups as well as domestic terrorist groups.** [...] **There is an effort between both the Obama Administration and the Clinton campaign to actively round up all of those against the status quo. I have seen these memos, but cannot make them public until I have some form of immunity.**\n>\n>**The fact is, whether you like it or not, is that vocal Trump supporters will likely find FBI and DoJ at their doors after the election of Hillary Clinton. They will be questioned, and some might be detained given their posts on social media. Even some pro-Trump journalists and bloggers are likely to be targeted.** From the internal documents I have compiled, this is an initiative set to be silently conducted in small operations over the span of the first 18 months of the Clinton Presidency. **What is set to transpire in the months to come is not only un-American, but definitely unconstitutional.** It will be painted as means to keep the peace, and fight suspected domestic terrorism plots.\n>\n> [...]\n\nDIRECT LINK TO THE LEAK WEBSITE: https://thebeltwayintern.wordpress.com/\n\nhttps://thebeltwayintern.wordpress.com/insurance/ (insurance files)\n\nhttps://thebeltwayintern.wordpress.com/documents/ (dox)\n",

Jill Stein is a joke and voting for her shows me you don't understand politics and are disrespecting Sen. Sanders in the process.\n\nSen. Sanders made a lot of progress in reforming politics ...in the Democratic party, not the Green party. The green party will not get one electoral vote...voting for Ms. Stien will not advance progressive ideals any more than voting for her did in the last election or the one before that...She will not get 1% of the vote let alone the 5% required to do anything in the next election.\n\nIf you want to make some sort of protest write a letter t o the editor at least somebody will see that if you vote for the greens out of protest nobody will even know ...you will not read about it in the paper...it will make 0 difference in anything that happens anywhere. \n\neither Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will be your next president and no one else will get even one electoral vote\n\nThe only caveat to that is the Libertarians may...may get 5%  of the vote...may.",

The reality is that \"work no-one wants to do\" is really \"work that no-one will do at the wages offered\". \n\nIncrease the wages, and at some point there will be people taking it up.\n\nSo illegal immigration causes wage depression for those jobs \"that no-one wants to do\", and so self-full-fills the mantra -- lower wages, and even less of an incentive for Americans to do those jobs.\n\nIt is actually worse than this. If there were no migrants prepared to work for less (and so depressing wages), then the American economy would have had to find efficiencies and increase productivity to get this essential work done. That is, the mass illegal migration also makes it less necessary to work more productively or innovatively at that end, making the economy less competitive, and in the long run leading to a loss of wealth.\n\nThat is, in short, what Leftists do not understand, and never will, because they are slaves to a different ideology rooted in Marxist internationalism.\n\nPs. And, of course, rather than doing the work no-one wants to do, the masses of migrants and immigrants ends up not wanting to do the jobs no-one wants to do, which then necessitates even more migrations, according to the Left.",

He gets it, and there are many lessons which can be learned about the vicious cycle of inflation-need for more social assistance - more inflation.  \n\nIn modern times this cycle is enhanced by mass migration which swells the size of people needing social assistance.",

Something related was brainstormed by campaign officials and let die because they made a conscious decision that they were \"never going to say anything about his background.\" Politifact is right that the rumours were not spread by the campaign. Full stop. \n\nThen?  Politifact goes on to say these rumours took on new life as other Clinton supporters rescued the issue from the scrap heap. Some time later, HRC and her campaign fired some of these volunteers, but Politifact admits that Clinton supporters \"circulated the \"birther\" theory in an email as early as April 2008.\"  More, Politifact then drops the other shoe: Clinton supporters are known to have started the \"Obama is a Muslim\" rumours as well, although they do not bother to mention that this rumour began with another Clinton supporter in 2004 during the Illinois senate race, but resurfaced during the presidential primary of 2008. \n\nWhoa! If you can shift the \"birther\" issue away from HRC, because it was not  the Clinton campaign, then the fact that *the Clinton campaign released a photo of BO in full muslim garb* put her squarely behind resurgent BO/Muslim rumours. \n\nI offer up this link from the Guardian, a progressive newspaper, in which the title is \"Clinton aides claim Obama photo wasn't intended as a smear.\" Surrrrre!\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/25/barackobama.hillaryclinton\n\nand this snippet from 60 Minutes where BO says \"this is a systematic email campaign\" concerning his Muslim background (20 second mark):\nhttps://grabien.com/file.php?id=36967&searchorder=date\n\nSo, now I am to believe HRC and her team are stupid? that they do not clear ideas through the campaign offices? that they do not test strategies in smaller markets?\n\nPolitifact did not go after the surreal  -  \"I invented the Internet\"  -  in Trump's comment, but threw mud on an unidentified volunteer from Iowa<?>  -  who just forwarded an email she had gotten to the campaign headquarters and was fired for it. Then they left this tidbit for you to find:\n>Another thing to note: Clinton volunteers forwarded emails promoting the myth that Obama is a Muslim. As we have previously reported, both resigned from the campaign after they were found to have spread the rumor. The Clinton campaign condemned their actions and said it was unauthorized.\n\n***Nice work there Politifact!***\n\n",

For u/cherwilco to actually think they can get away with saying this they must assume no one will read past the byline.\n\nIt is a pastiche of citations.  It is filled with links.  In fact you would have to try hard not to see the links and citations considering the entire Newsbuster model is based less on writing than it is in putting news pundits and reporters in their own words.\n\nSaying a Newsbuster article has no citations or links is an insult to your intelligence.\n\nAs for why it matters?  At this point... who knows?  Trump forced Obama's hand to settle the issue 5 years ago.  At this point... We'd have to ask the Clinton campaign who gave a speech on it this week and you would also have to ask the editors of heritage news outlets.  Donald Trump certainly didn't bring it up.",

        "comment": "This is a remarkable exchange from an interview with Donald Trump on Fox and Friends this morning:\n\n    QUESTIONER: Lester Holt \u2014 should he be a moderator, and just ask questions, or should he be a fact checker, where he asks a question, and if somebody says something that he thinks is wrong, that he\u2019s gonna try to correct the record? What would you like to see \u2014 a moderator, or a fact checker?\n\n    TRUMP: Well, I think he has to be a moderator. You\u2019re debating somebody, and if she makes a mistake, or if I make a mistake, we\u2019ll take each other on. But I certainly don\u2019t think you want Candy Crowley again.\n\n    QUESTIONER: [Snickers knowingly.] She was wrong!\n\n    TRUMP: I really don\u2019t think you want that. That was a very pivotal moment in that debate. And it really threw the debate off. And it was unfair. So I don\u2019t think you want that. No, I think you have to have somebody that just lets \u2019em argue it out.\n\n    You know, I think there\u2019s a lot of pressure on Lester. I think Lester\u2019s a very good person, a very good man. I think there\u2019s a lot of pressure on him. You know, when I had the town hall, last week with Hillary, I did well, and I had tough questions. But the polls all had her taking a drubbing\u2026.They went after Matt Lauer, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it\u2026.That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing with Lester Holt\u2026and a lot of people are watching to see whether he succumbs to that pressure.\n\nAs you may recall, during one of the 2012 debates, Candy Crowley gently pointed out that Mitt Romney was wrong when he said that Obama had not immediately called the Benghazi attacks an \u201cact of terror.\u201d The wrath of Romney supporters bore down on Crowley for days in the wake of this shocking transgression. But, despite the snickering on Fox and Friends about this, Crowley was basically right: On the day after the attacks, Obama said: \u201cno acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation.\u201d\n\nIt would not be unreasonable for the upcoming debates\u2019 moderators to hear Trump\u2019s allusion to Crowley and conclude that if they challenge him on the facts, they can expect to be subjected to days and days of rage and abuse from his surrogates and supporters, just as she was. After all, as he put it, \u201ca lot of people\u201d (i.e., his supporters) will see such conduct as \u201csuccumbing\u201d to pressure from Clinton supporters, and they\u2019re \u201cwatching\u201d for that.\n\nOpinions newsletter\n\nThought-provoking opinions and commentary, in your inbox daily.\n\nIt\u2019s true, as Trump argues, that Clinton and her supporters went hard after Matt Lauer after the recent town hall, because they were unhappy with his soft questioning of Trump, and that many went on to cite the Lauer failure as a cautionary tale for the debate moderators to avoid. This, as Trump notes, is also a form of pressure and ref-gaming.\n\nBut the careful observer will note an important difference here. Many of those who criticized Lauer\u2019s performance faulted him for failing to challenge Trump\u2019s well documented falsehoods in real time (in particular, his claim that he opposed the Iraq War). By contrast, Trump is telegraphing that his supporters will hammer the moderators if they do challenge his well documented falsehoods in real time.\n\nIn other words, one side wants the moderators to hold the candidates accountable, and the other doesn\u2019t. We can argue endlessly over whether those in the former camp are trying to game the debates so that Trump faces tougher questioning than Clinton does. But the bottom line is that, given that it is simply true that Trump lies a lot more frequently, audaciously, and egregiously than Clinton does, and that it took many months before this was widely acknowledged in the press, most Clinton supporters would probably be just fine with equivalent treatment of both of their assertions at the debate, and if they aren\u2019t, they should be.\n\nSome have argued that when it comes to how the moderators conduct the debates, there is an important difference between fact-checking the candidates and subjecting them to persistent follow-up questions, and that moderators should focus on the latter. But in a way, the distinction isn\u2019t really that important here. Trump essentially stated outright on Fox above that the moderators\u2019 proper role should be to get out of the way entirely and let the candidates go at it with one another \u2014 a free-for-all format that he probably expects to dominate, given his reality TV experience.\n\nIn other words, Trump is putting the moderators on notice that they have no business playing an aggressive role in trying to inform the public about whether what the candidates are saying is true or not. It\u2019s hard to imagine that any self-respecting journalist would willingly submit to Trump\u2019s directive.",

The problem is, academia and some in the media (most beholden to DNC political interests), won't acknowledge what really happened.  McCarthy wasn't an altruistic senator trying to save his country, but likewise, neither are the people that ignored the evidence.\n\nWe should strive to make everyone equal under the law.  This kind of partisan slant is wrong no matter who does it.  And the idea that conservatives want to support Putin is ludicrous.  They are just as anxious to crowd him off the economic world stage because he won't give away Russian resources like Yeltsin did.\n\nThe current crop of media mavens paints Putin as the next Hitler.  While he's no Jefferson, he isn't committing mass genocide, as our WW2 ally Stalin did.  He's incredibly popular in Russia because he ran off most of the oligarchs that Yeltsin let run rampant.  Putin's next on the chopping block for the Interventionists, along with Syria and North Korea, of course.  All this intervening does nothing to help the U.S., unless you happen to be in the Defense Industry.\n\nWitch hunts are bad.  Supporting them, even when it's not \"your guy\", is foolish.  The wheel turns and then the \"other guy\" will be in the seat of power.\n\nThe Soviet Union is gone.  Don't help to restart the Cold War.",

Nobody is even talking about intervening in Russia like they might want to in Syria or the DPRK.  Russia is in the same category as China, problems you have to deal with because you'll never get rid of them.  Putin is our enemy, he knows it and acts accordingly.  That is why he's hacking us and making Syria as much of a black eye for America as possible.  Not acting because we fear the old cold war only puts him at the advantage.\n\nYou are right that a witch hunt wouldn't do are country any good, even if it is going after the people I don't like.  However such witch hunts are the continued bread and butter of the right, and holding this against them is a great rhetorical tool to prevent it.  Conservatives love to accuse liberals as communists traitors to this day, pointing out their ideological support of Putin's Russia is the perfect response.  \n\nI'll agree that traditional conservatives don't support Putin, but Trump and the deplorable base do.  They often compliment him and contrast him to Obama, saying he is a stronger leader with more support from his people.  \n\nHilary isn't a nice person, and that is probably her best feature in our current political situation.  Attacking conservatives as pro-Putin is an effective and justified angle for her.  Obama tried the positive hope angle and all it got him was a Republican led congress that vowed to block anything he wanted to do.

The Russians are not going to give up their only warm water port because of regime change in the Ukraine sponsored by the U.S.  If intervening in Russia is a bad idea, then you must agree that intervening in the Ukraine is just as bad.  The Russians are not going to sit still while we overthrow a country next to them any more than we would sit back and let them take over Mexico.\n\nNo, opposing them is not a top priority.  They're not the Soviet Union.  They're just another country now.  One closer to democracies than many others.  Russia is nowhere near China.  China is still a Communist dictatorship, albeit with many caveats.  And China is our banker, they're not our enemy either.  Why would you start a war with the people that owe you money?\n\nThe \"Russian Hacker\" theory can't be proven because the Internet won't allow you to definitively locate a hacker.  And even if it came from Russia, we have plenty of hackers in this country that hack everything, but they don't work for our government.\n\nYou say you don't like witch hunts in one breath and then in the next it's  \"the right\" this and \"the right\" that.  The left/right dynamic is breaking down and it was never anything but a way to quickly divide people.  Libertarians are on the \"right\" of many things, but we have the most reasonable candidate in the election.\n\nI'm not seeing a tremendous amount of GOP members doing the red scare.  I'm seeing most of it from the Clinton campaign, as a tool to bash Trump, which is weird, since there's already plenty of things to bash him about.\n\nTrump doesn't \"support\" Putin.  Like most people, he'd rather not start WW3 over the Ukraine.  I don't support Trump, but his campaign fought to pull arming the Ukraine out of the GOP platform, while the DNC did the opposite.  Funding a group of Neo-Nazis on the Russian border is insane and not doing it is Trump's few sane position.  Probably because, like Putin, he's an authoritarian.  \n\nThere is plenty of middle ground today, but only if you're willing to finally abandon the GOP and DNC.  Who could support parties willing to prop up such corrupt candidates?",

It didn't take much for Clinton to provoke him into reverting to form.\n\nNow, being the clown is how he got the GOP nomination. He played to the base and gave them what they want to hear. They're already committed to voting for him. What Clinton did was show the rest of the nation that it isn't just an act, *this is the real Donald Trump.* Is this really who we want representing us as our President?\n\nWe've still got about six weeks to the election so there's still time for an October surprise to erase the voting public's memory and replace it with a new scandal, but that assumes Trump can shape up and not be himself for six more weeks. Based on his reaction to the debate results I'm not holding out much hope for him.",

This faulty information then spreads to every government body, organization, and study that cites these statistics. The resulting gap in information is monumental, all due to a poorly-written definition.\n\nMy suggested rewrite is as follows:\n\n> Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina, anus, or urethra, with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, or the touching a person's face with a sex organ, without the consent of one or more of the individuals involved in the act\n\nThis new definition includes the insertion of anything into the urethra, the touching of the genitals to a person's face, regardless of whether it involves insertion, and a clear indication that the act is a rape regardless of which person involved has been made to participate in this act without consent.\n\nI know that people have varying degrees of faith in WhiteHouse.gov petitions, as well as in the current presidential administration, but this is an issue that reaches across party lines, that affects large portions of our society, would require very little effort to fix (the president could direct the FBI to change its language virtually immediately), and comes with very little in the way of political drawbacks \u2013 a more comprehensive definition of rape makes for more accurate and comprehensive statistics, which benefits *everyone*.\n\nWith this being the case, I am trying to get the word out about this petition and encourage as many people as possible to sign on to it. I hope you will too.\n\nThank you!\n\nThe petition can be found [here](https://wh.gov/iM2JQ)",

If you don't understand why that's important, that's ok, but please take the time to read this and educate yourself on the issue.\n\n>**5% Vote in 2016 = $10 Million Public Funding in 2020**\n\n>5% of the vote nationally is another important threshold. If the Stein campaign reached it, the Green Party would qualify for general election public funding in 2020 that will be worth over $10 million. The public funding for minor parties that qualify (5% to 25% in the previous election) is based on the ratio of the percentage received by the minor party to the average percentage received by the major parties. The minor party gets a grant that is that ratio's fraction of the major parties' grants. Until Congress passed and Obama signed a bill eliminating public funding for national conventions last year, 5% would have also qualified the Green Party for about $2 million for organizing their 2020 national convention, which could have been used to support state Green parties to get organized to elect their delegations and hold their primaries, caucuses, platform hearings, candidate debates, and so forth. \n\nA Vote for Stein will accomplish exactly the \"bottom up\" change you are looking for *in future elections*.\n\n[**There are 279 Green Party Candidates seeking office in 2016.**](http://www.gp.org/2016_candidates)\n\nI will be voting for any Progressive/Green down ballot as well this election.\n\nFrom my perspective, it's not a waste of time if it takes a vote away from any establishment candidate. I don't care whether Trump or Hillary are President, they're both equally awful albeit for different reasons, so I'm using my vote to prop up the only Progressive in the race and Her party.",

But I doubt his personal politics explains why the Atlantic editorial board as a whole is making this rare exception from their consistent longtime policy of not endorsing in presidential campaigns except in the most extreme of cases.\n\nSecondly, as true as it is that Clinton supported the Iraq war and is generally more pro-military-intervention than Obama and Sanders and many other Democrats, she's nowhere close to the Republican mainstream or the Republican policy establishment on that.  McCain, Romney, Cruz, Rubio, etc... but also Trump, who supported the Iraq war initially but halfheartedly only because he didn't seem to even think it was important, who said Japan and Saudi Arabia should have nuclear weapons, who thinks the US should invade oil fields in the middle east and occupy them with troops!  Trump may not *care* about some wars as much as others, but a) he's extremely reckless and liable to want to lash out with the military to avenge perceived slights, and b) when he doesn't care, he'd go with the policies of the Republicans around him and other Republicans that his administration brings in, most of whom make Clinton seem like a peacenik in comparison.\n\nYes, it's frustrating that Clinton won instead of Sanders or someone more Obama-like.

Smith knows a thing or two about Clinton corruption. After working at FBI headquarters as a section chief in the National Security Division, he retired as special agent in charge of the Little Rock, Ark., field office, where he investigated top Clinton fundraisers for public corruption and even Chinese espionage.\n\n>\u201cFBI agents upset with Comey\u2019s decision have every reason to feel that way,\u201d Smith said. \u201cClearly there was a different standard applied to Clinton.\u201d\n\n>\u201cI have no doubt resourceful prosecutors and FBI agents could have come up with some charge that she would have been subject to prosecution,\u201d the 25-year veteran added. \u201cWhat she did is absolutely abhorrent for anyone who has access to classified information.\u201d\n\n>Smith said Congress should subpoena the case\u2019s agents to testify about the direction they received from Comey and their supervisors: \u201cIt would be interesting to see what the results would be if those involved with the investigation were questioned under oath.\u201d",

Comments about forcibly grabbing women's genitals, or kissing them without consent, shouldn't come as a surprise. \n\nI guess at least he doesn't think using nukes is okay, and he is an alright public speaker.

Since currently the biggest threat is still Wall Street's gambling, I distrust anybody mingling with em too much. Clinton's donor list, her hiding of speech transcripts and her husband's track record of removing the Glass-Steagal Act on request of citigroup worry me.\n\n* Who will be least likely to escalate relations with China/Russia/Stable Middle Eastern Countries. Clinton's conspiracy theories about Russia and her announcement to react to cyber attacks with war, as well as her track record in Libya worry me.\n\nIn regards to those aspects nothing has changed in the last week and I think everything else is secundary and can be reversed in the next election, if necessary.",

I don't see how being an early riser disqualifies from holding office. I have no idea how Trumps sleep cycle looks like and being awake at 3 am doesn't worry me at all. Many famous leaders sleep just a couple of hours a night and compensate with naps in the afternoon. Is Trump sleeping on his plane in the afternoon really such a weird concept?\n\nThe best example to show that foreign policy and personal habits are barely related is probably JFK. He was often in the oval office from 8am to 4am and would take a short nap in the afternoon and don't get me started on Kennedy's female acquaintances. He still managed to keep the Cold War cold during the most dangerous episodes.\n\nMy assesment of the candidates therefore remains the same.",

Since you asked I hope I provided you some insight into what about half of American voters think and how they can still support Trump.\n\nMaybe tweets about a beauty queens are unpresidentcial, but it was Clinton who brought her up during the debate and Trump responded. If Clinton decides to react to Bill Clinton's rape accusations tonight at 3am I wouldn't hold it against her and would be curious what she had to say.\n\nAnd one last thought: I personally think his ego is a positive thing. I think Trump wants to be remembered as a good president and therefore has his priorities straight in my book. Maybe a little ego is not that bad. He sure wouldn't want to be remembered as the guy who either crashed the economy or who killed millions of his citizens in a pointless war.",

That's like saying that harvesting and storing corn encourages the growth of deadly mold...It does if you don't do it properly.\n\nTrickle-down economics (supply side economics) thrives on maximizing efficiency. Crony corporatism finds it easier to secure inefficient corporate empire monopolies through government that the market would naturally kill off because they are structurally unsustainable in a freer market. 9 out of 10 businesses fail within the first 10 years. The free market works like a genetic algorithm (theoretically) so you know if a business in a truly free market thrives then someone has found a way to make a sustainable business through setting up capital, processes, procedures, raw materials and manpower in a specific pattern that succeeds. Not just succeeds for the business but succeeds for the consumer to, so much so that people would rather trade their money for the thing that business provides than keep it.\n\n\n**That's not easy to do.**\n\nWhat is easy to do is to hire a lobbyist to promote laws favorable to your interests and unfavorable to society at large (like insurance companies no being able to sell policies over state lines, or taxi's trying to ban Uber, or Telsa no being able to sell cars without going through a dealership). So this is easily taken advantage of by opportunist politicians who label it as a failure of capitalism and then promote the opposite.",

It's not about coming to your own conclusions about what probably happened; it's not about forming opinions, especially when you're not in a position of authority to deprive that person of rights.\n\nIt's pretty blindingly obvious that when multiple women unconnected to each other come out and say that Trump did to them exactly what he bragged about being able to get away with, that yes, he did do those things.  I'm not a jury convicting him of a specific crime with a specific punishment, I'm just coming to a reasonable conclusion and forming an opinion, and so are lots and lots of other people.",

The impending Cold War II with Russia (and probably China) has shattered any hope of peace and prosperity in our time, and America is descending into an Orwellian nightmare, presumably under Hillary!'s leadership.

Under the regimes of President Reagan in the US and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the UK, neoliberalism led to massive tax cuts for the rich, the destruction of trade unions, a growing inequality of wealth, deregulation, privatization, unemployment and the decline of public services -- with the exception of prisons and the military-industrial complex.",

No.\n\nhttp://religiondispatches.org/did-clinton-campaign-mock-catholics-not-really/\n\n> In what the Washington Times is characterizing as an \u201cassault on Catholics,\u201d Clinton campaign spokesperson Jennifer Palmieri discussed conservative Catholics in an email exchange with John Halpin, a senior fellow at the progressive Center for American Progress. Halpin marveled that two prominent conservatives, Fox News creator and News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch, and Wall Street Journal Managing Editor Robert Thompson, are raising their kids Catholic, noting that Murdoch even had his kids baptized \u201cin Jordan where John the Baptist baptized Jesus.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.mediaite.com/online/bill-clinton-mocks-trump-supporters-as-your-standard-redneck/\n\n> During an event to promote voter registration, Clinton offered a somewhat self-deprecating characterization of the mogul\u2019s supporters, saying they remind him of people he knew in Arkansas before he became state governor and then president.\n\n> \u201cLook man, the other guy\u2019s base is what I grew up in,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m basically your standard redneck.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/wikileaks-emails-reveal-clinton-campaigns-strategy-to-woo-needy-latinos/ar-AAiTHOh?li=BBnbcA1&%252525252525253Bocid=edgsp\n\n> The emails from Podesta\u2019s gmail account reveal the ego-stroking and horse-trading involved in courting top supporters. In one 2015 email entitled, \u201cNeedy Latinos,\u201d Podesta urged Clinton to call former Energy Secretary Fedrico Pena, who is \u201cclose to committing but carrying some baggage,\u201d and former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, \u201cnotwithstanding the fact that he can be a d***.\u201d\n\nWhen you're desperately digging through the shit in alt-right propaganda sites for something -- *anything* -- to smear Clinton with rather than engage her on policy and issues it's pretty obvious that you have nothing substantial to argue with.",

It's going to magnify the anger against Clinton in the Demorats so when they do get into office, not only will the Republicans be very hostile toward the administration, the voters will be too.  That will translate into a very hostile Congress and a devastating mid-term election for the Dems.  The GOP sounds like it will START the second Clinton Administration with impeachment hearings and they have plenty of evidence.  It will be just a matter of time before the media, in an attempt to save what little credibility they have left, throws Clinton under the bus.",

You're buying into a media construct that isn't the vast majority of Americans.  And that construct is pushed by the media, who is complicit in keeping certain people in power.  Right now, it's Hillary Clinton.  She's the NeoCon's choice, the Goldman Sachs candidate.  Way back when it was Bush II and Obama is a disgrace, as would any president who created a \"kill list\".\n\nThat doesn't make the Republicans better, but understand who the enemy is.

Now, forget it.\n\n\"All they did was give him airtime, there was no manipulation.\"\n\nIf you watched the debates or any broadcast, it's as bad as Fox News.  All Hillary stories and questions start light and airy, \"Madame Secretary\", \"the former Secretary of State\" and it's always a DNC press release like \"gave a speech to an excited crowd\", \"outline her plans once she's president to...\".  Trump's adjectives are only negative.  \"Trump fought off charges...\"  he is always \"struggling in the polls\" and his allies are always \"leave him again\".\n\nIn the debates, the moderators attacked Trump directly, but allowed Clinton to answer questions.  The Clinton emails have been downplayed despite the huge cache coming out of WikiLeaks.  And now that it's gotten so bad, CNN is finally \"addressing\" them by spinning them on behalf of Clinton.\n\nYes, Trump is an a-hole.  Which makes it worse because a good candidate could easily beat him.  Sanders would've beaten him.\n\nFox News stuff doesn't justify it.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  This \"payback\" is only going to reinforce negative stereotypes about liberals.  The polarization drives people to Trump.\n\nGet over Obama.  He drone-bombed an apartment building in Pakistan on his third day in office.  He's a war criminal just like Bush AND Clinton.\n\nThere is a great benefit to electing Trump.  The Congress will be openly hostile to him, so his wacky wall and various domestic policies will go nowhere.  He wants peace with Russia and might actually get us out NATO, which would be a great thing.  And if he left ISIS to the Russia, maybe he'd finally bring the troops home.\n\nClinton is the opposite.  Her domestic plans sound good and she knows how to present them to pressure Congress, but most are just spending on top of spending that will do nothing but add debt.  At the same time, she can't wait to start humanitarian wars in Syria, parts of Africa and the Ukraine.  All much, much worse than what Trump has proposed.  \n\nThe only upside to Clinton is that she's so corrupt and there's so much to attack her for, she might actually start her administration with impeachment proceedings.  The GOP would be happy to drag her back in front of Congress and spend her whole term fighting.  It might slow her down.  Of course a war would be a quick way to unite the country behind her.\n",

Note the mention of \"manipulating\" people's \"anxieties\".  As fond as the left is of the term, this is a \"dog whistle\", in that this paper is subtly using the term \"anxieties\", when they really mean pseudo-racism, or -homophobia, or any of the other left-wing boogeymen.  They use words like \"raw\", and \"rough\", when they refer to anyone that they don't deem to agree with their views; \"darker\" and \"somber\", when in actuality most centrists, libertarians and conservatives want to return to times when the political elites inside the Beltway didn't have nearly complete control over the country.  They think their views are bright and positive; they look at a positive future where the central control from DC is lessened, and people are afforded more freedoms, not more rules and regulations.\n\nAnd lest you think I am some sort neo-conservative devotee, let me assure that is not the case.  Journalistically, I prefer the Edward R Murrow approach, and I am an old-fashioned libertarian/conservative.  Fewer regulations to the extent it is possible, and more liberty for the people.  And in my view, Hillary Clinton is the complete antithesis of what I think a Chief Executive should be.  And I have great fear of the \"dark, somber\" deal that has been struck between her party and the fifth estate.",

        "comment": "I'm trying to find a more polite word than \"twaddle,\" but I can't. \n\nLook, I'm certainly not going to argue that the media isn't in the tank for Hillary. They clearly are. What I will argue is that there has ever been a time when media was *not* the voice of political elites. (Or those with the ambition to become a political elite.) \n\nI'm also going to take issue with WHY they are \"in the tank.\" And it's not due to liberal bias. Not primarily. I think it's a combination of embarrassment and sheer panic, plus ownership panic about what Trump's trade policies would mean to their multinational owners.\n\nAnd there's never been a consensus among the political elites, either. Well, very rarely - and that's usually a consensus against the interests of almost everyone else. For every MSNBC, there has been a FOX. For every Guardian, there is a Daily Mail. For every CBC, there is an RT. (just so I could throw in the image of two state organs dicksizing each other.)\n\nFact is, with the exception of Fox under Ailes and with the sometime exception of RT, none of those are outright propaganda. And even in cases when it's an editorial perspective from an inside-the-beltway, US-Centric, Limousine-Liberal perspective - it doesn't actually follow that they are wrong. \n\nAnd the converse is true. I've been pleasantly surprised to find evidence of intelligent life on Brietbart from time to time.  But let's get back to the quote you seemed to find telling, since it is.\n\nThere's nothing \"leftist\" in that quote you quoted. There's a number of naked assertions; none I find implausible, but if you wish to take issue with them, feel free. I certainly do feel that TV has gotten a lot edgier and darker; far, far less optimistic in tone. And I don't see that as a \"leftist\" analysis. I see that as a fairly straightforward observation. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm something of a student of media and propaganda, and while I'm no expert, I see a great deal more of the classic tactics of manipulation and propaganda on the right than I do on the left. And I make a point of calling it out when I see it; check my post history, I literally did just that for a really lazy-ass Salon piece. The reason there's less of it on the left is not because of any inherent distaste or moral superiority. It's because \"when the facts are on your side, argue the facts.\" \n\nI once aspired to a career in journalism before life got in my way and I read with a critical eye. But look up the word \"liberal.\" It's not a bias - it's a coherent worldview and it's the most natural to a journalist. It demands that you be in contact with reality. You may prefer Murrow - and I would agree.

He keeps crying about unfair this and unfair that, rather than lay out any vision for America. Millions do literally turn into billions if you leave them alone, it's called the miracle of compound interest. Trump would've made more money, and screwed over less shareholders by putting his inheritance in an index fund. Let's be clear that if Trump were born middle class he would still be middle class. He doesn't have the skills or knowledge to make money from nothing like say, Mark Cuban, a real businessman. \n\nI've examined his platform. His tax policy makes no sense and would be financially disastrous for this country unless you're a rich friend of Trump's.

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> With today&#039;s latest ABC / Washington Post poll, the real &quot;Smoking gun&quot; admission is revealed as the pollsters admit that the narrowing of their polling results are &quot;Not mainly about people shifting in their candidate preference&quot; but about how their sample pool was constructed.\n\n> Now, while ABC / Wapo claim that the 10-point swing was driven by changes in &quot;Who&#039;s intending to vote,&quot; we find it quite curious that their own data shows just a 2-point swing in people who said they were &quot;Certain to vote&quot; on 10/23, when the poll reflected a 12-point Hillary lead, and 10/27 when the lead had collapsed to just 2 points.\n\n> Are we really expected to believe that a 2-point swing in voter intentions somehow translated to a 10-point swing in the poll results? Not likely...something tells us it had a little more to do with including &quot;Ethnic &#039;oversamples&#039; as required.\"\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/5aa7aa/abcwapo_effectively_admit_to_poll_tampering_as/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~12898 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **poll**^#1 **vote**^#2 **ABC**^#3 **results**^#4 **sample**^#5",

        "comment": "It is a scary time for some white guys. They are having to come to terms with the fact that being white isn't going to automatically put them in the lead anymore. They still get taught all of the ugly misogynist messages about consent (look at pretty much every action hero. They almost always pursue a woman who acts like she doesn't like his advances until he somehow wins her love with his aggression and physical superiority) but when they go to apply all those bad lessons in the real world women call them out and they suffer. \n\nIn a lot of big ways, what it means to \"be a man\" has become blurred and muddled with mixed messages. \"Man up, don't cry.\" \"Sensitive wussies don't get the girl.\" \"Art is for chicks.\" \"You throw like a girl!\" \"Bro, don't be a p*ssy.\" \"Trophies are for winners.\" \"What are you, queer?\" This kind of talk goes on from when they are young and for their whole lives. How could it not effect them? Their whole lives they are told that the best thing they can do is be aggressive, dominant, and rigidly masculine. Anything feminine, submissive, or emotional is bad and any man displaying such qualities should be shamed/crushed. But when they go to live those ideals society turns on them. I am not excusing sexism, racism, homophobia, or any of the other awful things some guys do. I just want to point out why they thought it was okay to do that stuff in the first place.\n\nAdd to that the fact that they are suffering under the current economic situation, and are no longer uncontested in terms of cultural/economic dominance and you have a perfect recipe for pissed off angry dudes. If you are an angry white guy, who feels himself losing his superiority, who feels cheated by his government, who is struggling financially, and who is vilified for living up to the messed up messages you were told as a boy then Trump and his call to return to a mythical \"Golden Age\" of America where none of those problems exists sounds very appealing.\n\nOf course, Trump will screw over his voters just like he screws over every other person who falls for one of his scams. I just hope America and the world don't have to suffer the consequences of this latest scam.",

From their [Wikipedia page:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_American_Progress)\n\n>Center for American Progress Action Fund[edit]\nFormerly known simply as the American Progress Action Fund, the Center for American Progress Action Fund (CAP Action) is a \"sister advocacy organization\"[22] and is organizationally and financially separate from CAP, although they share many staff and a physical address. Politico wrote in April 2011 that it \"openly runs political advocacy campaigns, and plays a central role in the Democratic Party\u2019s infrastructure, and the new reporting staff down the hall isn\u2019t exactly walled off from that message machine, nor does it necessarily keep its distance from liberal groups organizing advocacy campaigns targeting conservatives\".[23] Whereas CAP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, CAP Action is a 501(c)(4),[24] allowing it to devote more funds to lobbying.[25] In 2003, George Soros promised to financially support the organization by donating up to $3 million.[26] CAP Action is headed by Neera Tanden.[27]\n\nSo Soros is a funding mechanism, and Neera - famous in wikileaks of late - are connected.",

Others say the clause is so vague that it could be broadly interpreted to include a scenario like the Clinton Foundation.

It was a good job for a teenager.\n\nand in regards to who manufactured my house? Would employing construction workers who have the legal right to be here be so bad? Wouldn't it be better to pay a little more on a mortgage each month to ensure the housing association who hires the workers to build them, is paying a decent wage to American workers?\n\nI don't think people at the bottom are preventing America from being great. \nI hate that MAGA slogan. It's fucking silly. America is the most powerful economic force in the history of the human race. But we will drift more toward a one sided society that feeds the endless desires of an endless and corrupt cronie elite like Clinton and her wall street puppeteers. I'm for a more equal society for the people who live and reside here. Cronies and Joe Schmoes alike. And to the illegal immigrants who cross the borders looking to play and manipulate the system, yes I do hold them in contempt. As much contempt as the CEO who stuffs his pocket with bonuses while his workers take a pay freeze before Christmas. For the very simple reason. They influence wages. They lower the value of labor. They heinously and with self-entitled urge, accept a wage that underpays them. They don't care if they fuck up the wages and job opportunities of the young and working class Americans. they don't care because they only care about themselves. How similar they are in that vain to the CEO who does likewise. Don't you see how it's squeezing the middle and working classes from both sides. They're drowning in debt and have to stand by and pretend to like it. Because their politicians are already bought and paid to not listen and their debt is piling up and they spend their nights coming home and worrying about the price of bread for next weeks trip to super-market. There used to be a notion that Americans who worked hard could reap the rewards of a society built around recognizing honest effort. And now they're in competition to be recognized for accepting a humiliating salary. It's fucked up. And it's both the illegal immigrants AND oligarchs fault. \n\nand at what point did I say Trump is my guy? Trumps just another Oligarch. I completely agree with your opinion of him. BUT out of fucking nowhere the chance to change the political game finally fucking arrives. The media hates him, the political classes hate him. They've venomously tried to get rid of him, and he's made himself very fucking vulnerable because he's a corrupt moron. BUT Trumps is the spoon that finally stirs the fucking pot. He's a one term buffoon. But he's a challenge to the status quo shills like you, who want to see this skewered society continue the way it does. so in regards to me supporting Trump. It's not the same as liking him. Liking him and thinking he's useful are very different. \n\nYou just want the status quo to continue. You're comfortable with your position in life. I get it. But shame on fucking you for being a complacent bystander. A ball-less puddle of grey slime, a complete and utter fungus of a human being, growing with oozing contempt under the boot of 21st century oligarchy. \n\nI'm ashamed to even be in the same genus as you. and now I'm done with you.

A shill would be someone who's a mouthpiece for a particular person or espousing views that align with a concept.  I am not, but I am pointing out how you have a \"Do as I say, not as I do\" rhetoric going on.  Just so we're on the same page:\n\n> hypocrisy:   a situation in which someone **pretends to believe something** that they do not really believe, or **that is the opposite of what they do** or say at another time. - [SOURCE](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hypocrisy)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe hypocrisy isn't what went into the building of your home, but in the fact that you specifically stated:\n\n> keep all that illegally earned, un-taxed **money flowing out of the country.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYet your TV, your bed, even the clothes on your back that you purchased are a result of companies outsourcing labor and manufacturing.  Which means you are contributing to foreign economies rather than your own through your spending habits, or \"flowing money out of the country\"  as you succinctly put it.  If it's any solace, you probably have sent more money to China than the next illegal due solely to those purchasing habits.  Hence my statement \"Enjoy shopping at Walmart.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo you not see the double-standard?  Or perhaps your definition of it is different than what's in the Cambridge Dictionary, and that's why you falsely deemed that my usage of the term \"hypocrite\" was not used in the appropriate context?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am also calling out your unresearched opinion on the negative economic impact of illegal immigrants, which seems to be anecdotal.  Show me untainted research or papers that support your belief (or hypothesis) that they are the detriment to the US economy.  Or maybe even just show me some PEW research findings, like [this one](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/11/03/appendix-c-additional-map/) that shows the percentage share of unauthorized immigrant workers by state as of 2014, or even quotes with sources (like from the IRS):\n\n> IRS estimates that about 6 million unauthorized immigrants file individual income tax returns each year. Research reviewed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that between 70 percent and 80 percent of unauthorized immigrants pay federal, state, and local taxes. -[SOURCE](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th-congress-2007-2008/reports/12-6-immigration.pdf) \n\nOR\n\n> Illegal immigrants are estimated to pay in about $7 billion per year into Social Security. In addition, they spend millions of dollars per year, which supports the US economy and helps to create new jobs. - [SOURCE](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/05/business/illegal-immigrants-are-bolstering-social-security-with-billions.html)\n\nOR\n\n> The Texas State Comptroller reported in 2006 that the 1.4 million illegal immigrants in Texas alone added almost $18 billion to the state's budget, and paid $1.2 billion in state services they used. - [SOURCE](https://web.archive.org/web/20141213205836/http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/undocumented/undocumented.pdf)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also have to partially disagree with your statement about the US being the most powerful economic force.  While the United States is the world's largest national economy in nominal terms, it's the second largest according to purchasing power parity.  The first being China - [SOURCE](http://www.businessinsider.com/china-overtakes-us-as-worlds-largest-economy-2014-10).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd this corruption that you believe is permeating American society will somehow disappear if Trump is elected rather than Clinton?  You do see how the Donald is reactionary, right?  How do you think international relations will fare?  Or your economy?  This stirring of the pot metaphor... do you not realize that you'd be stirring with a stick of lit dynamite?  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou were going in the right direction in one of your other posts on here, but again splitting focus.  If you directly target the companies that hire undocumented workers with punishments, then the proverbial \"illegals working\" well dries up.  \n\nHere, let me give you an analogy.  If you want to kill an octopus, would you take out his tentacles or aim for the heart?  Please keep in mind that much like illegal workers, an octopus can get more tentacles to replace the ones he's lost.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd to somehow know my station in life through a vessel such as reddit is quite astounding.  But resorting to name calling.. it actually reminds me of a quote:\n\n> Nothing has more retarded the advancement of learning than the disposition of vulgar minds to ridicule and vilify what they cannot comprehend.\n\n\\- Samuel Johnson\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you had even bothered to look through my post history, you would have discovered your assumptions of my intentions misguided.  But do enjoy the cesspool of your thoughts as you watch the election and feel the rage towards others engulf you.  =\\^)\n\n",

Similarly it's supposed to work that if the American people vote into office someone that obviously shouldn't serve as President, the electorates are supposed to vote for the proper candidate. Unfortunately because of additional state laws that system is no longer in place. It is now basically set up that whoever wins the majority vote by district in that state gets all of the electorial votes for that state.

Although 3rd parties get a bad name as spoilers they rarely amount to a spoiling percentage as they would often split in half, and they dwarf in comparison to those that don't cast a vote at all.The problems in this country run deep and it is not going to be solved simply by caring more. The Foxes run the Hen House and they control who can come in and out.

Dave Duke is clearly a conservative. HuffPost is trying to say since Dave Duke is a genuine racist and supports Trump's agenda that means Trump is clearly a genuine racist. I'm not gonna deny a lot of Trump's diction doesn't come off as welcoming to minorities, but in no way does he come close to a fucking kkk member. There are always two sides of the spectrum and neither of them are right. Hatred can feel justified if you have a positive goal, but that doesn't justify the path you take to get there. ",

At that point, any entering satellite would face unprecedented risks of headfirst bombardment.](http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/space-debris/kessler-syndrome/)",

        "comment": "Bullshit, bullshit, bull-fucking-shit.  \n\n1: Trump didn't \"win big\".  Hillary won the vote.  Trump won the 18th century anachronism known as the electoral college, and only because of the extreme voter suppression thanks to the SCOTUS's renunciation of the Voting Rights Act.  Example:  Wisconsin.  Trump won by 30K votes; it's estimated that 300K votes were suppressed by the new ID laws.\n\n2: Part of the reason that the Democratic Party gets its ass handed to it on a regular basis is exactly that attitude - \"Oh, they beat us, so we have to be the loyal opposition.\"  Fuck that.  When have the Republicans in recent history (shit, going back to Nixon) *ever* been loyal opposition, as opposed to doing any-and-every-fucking-thing to thwart the Democrats and reacquire/reassert power?  The Merrick Garland nomination and their handling of it tells you all you need to know there.  \"They go low, we go high\" is s wonderful noble statement.  However, in modern politics, \"They go low, we go for the kneecaps\" is a much more viable strategy.  Voters don't respect a doormat.\n\n3:  When it gets to be too hard and too demanding (or the policies kick in and people start protesting him), Trumps ego and laziness are likely to kick in, and he'll resign.  What do we get then?  Pense, a Radical Christian Theocrat.  I think he has the capability of pushing the Big Red Button because \"then Jesus will just HAVE to come back!\"  That scares the living shit out of me.\n\n\nAfter the shit the Republicans pulled on Obama because they were aghast at a N-word in the White House (that miserable fuck McConnell is now talking about how they can \"erase\" Obama), fuck them in the skull with an axe.  I'm truly afraid we're looking at Germany 1933 here.  It would not surprise me if there's fighting in the streets before Trump's first term is over.  They want to remove peoples' rights, and a lot of people aren't going to stand for it.\n\nTL, DR:  Fuck that.  Republicans are evil.  Fight them with everything you've got.",

I think if you weren't completely blinded by identity politics, you might see things more effectively.\n\n\"Fact two; Once he had outed himself as a racist, in any ethical system that is real that should disqualify people from supporting him or voting for him.\"\n\nWell, as I'm sure you're well aware, we don't live in a perfect ethical universe and that ethics differ between groups of people.  So while that may be justification for your actions, how you apply your ethical matrix to others is the issue.  Assuming you want to win people over, calling them \"trollboi\" or whatever isn't exactly a winning strategy.\n\n\"Fact 3. Hillary may have many flaws, but nothing she has done is criminal on the same level as don.\"\n\nWell, I've been linking Wikileaks emails to your like-minded friends for days, but this article sums it up best.  You really should read them.  What Hillary did wasn't small, especially regarding Libya.  Orchestrating the death and destruction of a people and a culture---  I mean, that's gotta be way worse.  And the proof is there, if you bother to read it.  It's pretty dense.  I mean, there are thousands of emails.  It's not just stealing Clinton Foundation money for her daughter's wedding.\n\n\"Fact 4. Lybia fell as a domino due to Bush invading iraq. If hillary hadn't been at the helm of the state department, somebody probably less competent would have been.\"\n\nUnless you have a time machine that can show us the alternate history of another Earth, you have nothing to back that up.  McCain was lauding the LIbyans mere weeks before the bombing.  Kadaffi was touted as a \"reformed\" guy.  \"Our\" guy.  Hillary pushed Obama into it.  I have no love for Obama, but she really did.  Part of the plan to move weapons to al Nusra Front in Syria.\n\nIt was not a domino.\n\nAnd even if what you said was true, the WikiLeaks emails also show that the DNC used it's considerable media influence to drive \"Pied Piper candidates\" ie Trump, Cruz and Carson, to the front of the GOP pack so the moderates would be marginalized.  Trump got the nom thanks to the DNC, so they really rigged both primaries.\n\nSo the DNC and especially the Clinton Campaign, by your logic, must take responsibility for Trump.\n\n\"Last but not least, the fact remains that what is from and should be relegated to the past is racism, and illogical spin and propaganda and ignorance and etc, all of which you are demonstrating here. That will either be evolved past very soon, or it will cause human extinction.\"\n\nYou know the difference between facts and wishes, right?  What you just said here isn't a fact.  It's what you want.  Never gonna happen, especially if you keep calling people names.\n\nI mean, we here at Libertarian HQ would love open borders and trade with all countries.  So we don't want a wall.  Can't see why we can't come together on that and other issues.\n\n\"Humans can not move into advanced technology while still retaining tribal ethnocentrism as the glue of their culture. As soon as say for instance soft fission makes its way to palestinians, the playing field levels, and the minorities have every reason to consider it a fair zero sum infinite game and strike first.\"\n\nWell, you might want to have your college professor explain that stuff to you.  Because you don't sound very anti-racist if you're basically saying we're headed for a Race War.  That's the kind of stuff KKK members try to sell.\n\nAnd, like many protesters, you're not explaining how one might achieve this wonderful \"level playing field\".  You just assume it will eventually happen.  Humans are not equal.  They never will be equal because every individual is different.  Unless you're going to clone everyone into exact conformist duplicates, you're going to have to deal with the smart, stupid, brave, cowardly, etc.\n\n\"The ONLY real or rational or evolved actual forward thinking is to stop the racism, stop the cultural violence, stop the sexism, stop sexual violence, and have an egalitarian instead of fascist republican society.\"\n\nNot sure how ignoring the facts and calling people names gets you there.\n\n\"The future and cause and effect and the laws of reality weigh in here differently than you or people like you imagine.\"\n\nYou cannot read minds or tell the future.

Trump won 10 percent of voters who approve of Obama\u2019s presidency and 23 percent of voters who think the next president should \u201cbe more liberal,\u201d according to CNN data. Trump significantly outperformed Romney among union households. He did 14 points better than Romney among whites without a college degree, according to The New York Times, and 16 points better among households with less than $30,000 in income. The Trump Democrat turns out not to be a myth, but a meaningful constituency that just cost Clinton the presidency.",

Same thing with the supreme court.\n\n1. How do you silence media criticism? You make it punishable to criticize you. Of course you can't pass such a law in one go, congress will refuse, you have to start slowly, and add more and more laws making restrictions larger and larger. You can also buy up TV stations or make them federal property with force, so you can control what they say. But you START with something that sounds good; for example a law that makes it illegal to insult the president. Sounds reasonable right? Except soon, all criticism is deemed to be insults...\n\n2. How do you prevent your opponents from running against you? Simple: Throw them in jail on real or fake charges, doesn't matter.\n\n3. How do you make sure you win elections even if you don't have popular support? Voter intimidation, and slowly putting people loyal to you in control of voting, so that they simply can report the wrong numbers.\n\n4. How do you take control over the military? Easy: You replace the leadership with people loyal to you.\n\n\nThese things are done by pretty much every single dictator ever. Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Castro, Pinochet, Chavez, Kim Il-Sung, you name it. These are things you need to do to be a dictator. And notable is that if you don't plan to be a dictator, there is no real reason to do these things. \n\nAll clear so far? Ready for part 2?",

Lower prices would give consumers more money to spend elsewhere in the economy. As a result, other sectors of the economy would see new job growths. The advent of computer technology lead to extensive losses in jobs that required traditional methods of paper work and accounting yet we saw increases in other sectors of the economy that easily offset those losses.",

Yea, hypothetically speaking, some diner employees will be out of work but soon they will reenter the workforce through other jobs as has historically happened with other technological revolutions that disrupted the job market.\n\n>Computer tech still required people.

When robots and AI and so actually *take over* for people the game has changed.\n\nThe autonomous vehicle market has directly seen increased jobs for research and development, jobs that would not have existed prior. What's to say that jobs will not continue to be \"shifted\"? Computers are able to process information that used to take dozens if not hundreds of employees to do. All those jobs were gone yet there was no jobs crisis.\n\nToday, the US is near full employment despite the significant rises in automation so far. Any suggestion of when rising and irreversible underemployment will happen is just speculation.",

I don't think there is going to be a \"shifting\" as happened say, moving to industry from farm, assembly line from crafting, typewriters to word processors. \n\nWe also have to bring in not just \"I have a job\" but quality of life issues. It is easy to say there \"was no jobs crises\" but the fact is the jobs that exist get worse and worse in terms of pay and quality of life. It is misleading to say \"near full employment\" without discussing the quality of life the employment bestows upon the workers.\n\nRegardless.... all this still seems to me to shift sensible discussion from minimum wages to basic incomes.",

        "comment": ">The documents show, for example, that while Mr. Trump reported $7.4 million in interest income in 1995, he made only $6,108 in wages, salaries and tips. They also suggest Mr. Trump took full advantage of generous tax loopholes specifically available to commercial real estate developers to claim a $15.8 million loss in 1995 on his real estate holdings and partnerships.\n\n>But the most important revelation from the 1995 tax documents is just how much Mr. Trump may have benefited from a tax provision that is particularly prized by America\u2019s dynastic families, which, like the Trumps, hold their wealth inside byzantine networks of partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations.\n\n>The provision, known as net operating loss, or N.O.L., allows a dizzying array of deductions, business expenses, real estate depreciation, losses from the sale of business assets and even operating losses to flow from the balance sheets of those partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations onto the personal tax returns of men like Mr. Trump. In turn, those losses can be used to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income from, say, book royalties or branding deals.\n\n>Better still, if the losses are big enough, they can cancel out taxable income earned in other years. Under I.R.S. rules in 1995, net operating losses could be used to wipe out taxable income earned in the three years before and the 15 years after the loss. (The effect of net operating losses on state income taxes varies, depending on each state\u2019s tax regime.)\n\n>The tax experts consulted by The Times said the $916 million net operating loss declared by Mr. Trump in 1995 almost certainly included large net operating losses carried forward from the early 1990s, when most of Mr. Trump\u2019s key holdings were hemorrhaging money. Indeed, by 1990, his entire business empire was on the verge of collapse. In a few short years, he had amassed $3.4 billion in debt \u2014 personally guaranteeing $832 million of it \u2014 to assemble a portfolio that included three casinos and a hotel in Atlantic City, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, an airline and a huge yacht.\n\n>Reports that year by New Jersey casino regulators gave glimpses of the balance sheet carnage. The Trump Taj Mahal casino reported a $25.5 million net loss during its first six months of 1990; the Trump\u2019s Castle casino lost $43.5 million for the year. His airline, Trump Shuttle, lost $34.5 million during just the first six months of that year.\n\n>\u201cSimply put, the organization is in dire financial straits,\u201d the casino regulators concluded.\n\n>Reports by New Jersey\u2019s casino regulators strongly suggested that Mr. Trump had claimed large net operating losses on his taxes in the early 1990s. Their reports, for example, revealed that Mr. Trump had carried forward net operating losses in both 1991 and 1993. What\u2019s more, the reports said the losses he claimed were large enough to virtually cancel out any taxes he might owe on the millions of dollars of debt that was being forgiven by his creditors. (The I.R.S. considers forgiven debt to be taxable income.)\n\n>But crucially, the casino regulators redacted the precise size of the net operating losses in the public versions of their reports. Two former New Jersey officials, who were privy to the unredacted documents, could not recall the precise size of the numbers, but said they were substantial.\n\n>Politico, which previously reported that Mr. Trump most likely paid no income taxes in 1991 and 1993 based on the casino commission\u2019s description of his net operating losses, asked Mr. Trump to comment. \u201cWelcome to the real estate business,\u201d he replied in an email.\n\n>Now, thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax records, the degree to which he spun all those years of red ink into tax write-off gold may finally be apparent.\n\nAre we supposed to hate the player and not the game now?",

If a set of principles are the most likely set to create potentially violent people it only makes sense to try and remove those principles. Especially when you are the leader of the most powerful could try in the world.\n\nYou seem to be conflating a nation's success with its adoption of religious principles. The problem with Muslim nations isn't that they're Muslim but that they're not secular. In a secular nation it doesn't matter if the majority of the population is Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim or none. Nations that rule by religious principles aren't tolerant and don't allow people to explore their own success.\n\n> Put simply Islam does not mix well with the Western world.\n\nThere are millions of Muslims in the US and UK who have assimilated just fine, thank you. Islam is not the problem.\n\n> There's a blurry line where political correctness and racism meet but saying you dislike a religion is not crossing that line.

        "comment": "I think it's an extremely difficult one. By accepting refugees into the country (and I don't just mean refugees, we should help the people in need, but as an example people who come here only to work for cheaper wages than British people. They're not always skilled workers and we can be taken advantage of) we allow people in who before their homes were destroyed many were extremely anti West. But they have been put in an impossible position and forced to leave their own countries. They will accept help from anywhere as they are desperate. My Muslim friends have told me about refugees they have met and while they are overwhelming grateful to be safe they hold western civilisation responsible for the troubles in their own country. We've already seen British Muslims arrested for terrorist plots. How can we be sure we're not bringing more people like them in? I'm not going to pretend for a second I know of a better way to do things because I don't but it's a genuine concern. \n\nI worded that really poorly I apologise. What I meant was if all that is reported is a Muslim terror threat then obviously people will think this is their greatest threat. But what advantage is gained by only reporting Muslim extremism? You can't honestly say there is a conspiracy against Muslims. Freedom of press is apparent in this country. They have no reason not to report other terror threat. Terrorism sells newspapers regardless of who he terrorists are. \n\nI'm not sure why you used the Christian Post. Are you suggesting people believe that bullshit? It's reach is no more powerful to the average Christian than Isis propaganda is to the average Muslim. \n\nOK, so what you're saying is my Muslim friends understand they should fear their own extremists because they know those extremists have the ability and resources to attack their country. But they don't fear extremists who aren't able to reach them because they can't reach them? Makes sense. I agree. So, in the same vein America fears Muslim extremists as they have the ability to reach their cities. What's the issue there? I get you might believe it's not their greatest threat but it's a threat nonetheless. And certainly the majority of Americans believe it's their greatest threat so it would be suicide for Trump not to be seen trying to address that threat. \n\nI can't debate you on the movements of racist groups as I don't know enough about what you are seeing. I certainly haven't seen an increase in activities and I've always been aware of these things because of my group of friends. Let me be clear it's extremely difficult for me to be anything which even borders on being \"pro-white\" as my black, asian and middle eastern friends would quickly beat that out of me. I have a very diverse group of friends and I am privileged because of it. But when we share the view that Trump's at least right to have shaken things up with his provocative nature then I know we're on to something. \n\nYou assume I agree with what Trump is doing by fighting business with business. I do not. Only time will tell on that one. Not even you can say with any real certainty that Trump will fail. ",

The thing is that his promises always were and always will be false. He can't guarantee our safety and never could. We can never guarantee that we'll always be safe. The only thing we can do is slash our liberties in the hopes of improving our security but I reject that. I choose liberty, not safety.

Fear of the \"Other\" is always sensational and we have very powerful political and religious interests in painting Muslims as the \"Other.\" So when a religious nut goes and shoots up a gay bar in Miami we're told that the Muslim extremist did it for religious reasons, but when a Christian religious nut goes and shoots up a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs we're told he was just mentally ill, not religious.\n\nYou're being lied to, and it's working because it's feeding your bias.\n\n> I'm not sure why you used the Christian Post.

And certainly the majority of Americans believe it's their greatest threat so it would be suicide for Trump not to be seen trying to address that threat.\n\nSo we don't elevate that threat above other, more imminent threats. We don't target it to the exclusion of all others. We deal with it like we deal with the other problems we face: with courage, persistence and respect. We don't go and assume every Muslim is a potential terrorist any more than we assume every Christian is a right-wing militia member. No one is saying that there aren't threats to be found among Muslims, but those threats don't justify the extreme policies being promised by the Trump administration.\n\n> But when we share the view that Trump's at least right to have shaken things up with his provocative nature then I know we're on to something.\n\nYour confirmation bias is showing.\n\n> Not even you can say with any real certainty that Trump will fail.\n\nI'm absolutely willing to revisit this conversation next year, the year after and four years from now.

He knew he'd win because he's not blind to what the American people believe. They believe Islam is their enemy and you cannot blame them for that. If you don't tackle what the people fear most you will lose. That's why Clinton never had a chance. She didn't connect with the people no matter how hard she tried. And you're right he can't promise complete safety all the time. But when Americans don't feel safe from an Islam that wants to kill they want Trump who is at least offering action. You do not represent the views of the majority of the American people so you will always be anti-Trump. Trust me for most of this election I have been too. He appeared to be a bumbling idiot who had no idea what he was doing but he won in the end and it wasn't even close. He knows his people. Call him pro-white if you like but there are plenty of people in the black community who are right behind the \"war on terrorism\" and only Trump had new ideas on protecting the American people.\n\nMy confirmation bias is showing? I have a diverse group of friends from different races and religions. We discuss all manner of things and all points of view are not only listened to but accepted as valid. We differ on many many things but we all agree Trump might just be what America needs but he's certainly, if nothing else, a breath of fresh air. Yet I am somehow bias? I think accepting the points of view from different sources is the exact opposite of bias. I think because I don't necessarily accept YOUR point of view is where you have issue. \n\nAustralia? A country which has a very tight grip on who enters it's country. Who's national opinion is welcome to our country, here's how we live, we welcome all faiths but we're a Christian country if you don't like that then fuck off. In fact their most recent census I believe chose \"no religion\" as a result of citizens who are worried about Islam! And on top of that there are campaigns for people to register as Christian in the next census to stop the country \"officially being declared Muslim\". But that's the UK, the USA and Australia all worried about Islam but their all mostly white people so they're just pro-white right?\n\nI think you're a bit conflicted yourself. You like to throw around how you know exactly why I think what I think. How my \"bias\" is being fed and I'm not paying attention. You cherry pick these articles from the media to express your point but point out we have sensationalism and multiple agendas in our corporate media. The same media you like to quote so often. That makes your articles null and void surely. You know zero about me so don't pretend you've got some kind of higher understanding of the world and I've just not reached it yet. It's so easy to belittle someone and it wreaks of insecurity. If you're not able to discuss without attacking there's little point in any of this and everything you've said can be completely discounted as not valid or worthwhile. ",

[\u201cFord had never announced any intention of moving Kentucky jobs to Mexico\u201d](http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/11/18/ford-takes-knee-will-not-move-kentucky-mexico/).\n\nMy guess is that Ford is attempting to redirect attention away from the fact that they are still moving **small car** production to Mexico by making it seem as if they decided to keep their truck plant in Kentucky, something that was going to happen anyway. The phrasing of [their statement](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2016/11/18/ford-motor-company-statement-on-us-manufacturing.html) is interesting there:\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, we confirmed with the President-elect that, with his support, our **small Lincoln utility vehicle** made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\u201d Note their interesting inclusion of the word \u201csmall\u201d in it. Nowhere do they say that they were going to move it nor that he was instrumental in changing their minds. They really are saying nothing of substance, but are in fact brown-nosing Trump for reasons I cannot fathom. To me it actually seems like quite the snarky announcement: \u201cWater is wet.\u201d\n\nThen Trump turns that around and, with his Tweet, makes it seem as if he was instrumental in \u201ckeeping them from moving\u201d when it\u2019s really nothing more than \u201cthey are keeping the plant there.\u201d  They could easily have written, \u201cWith Trump\u2019s support, we will continue to make vehicles.\u201d and it would be as accurate and, undoubtedly, Trump would take credit for Ford\u2019s ongoing vehicle production.\n\nI know it\u2019s a bit of a weird leap, but it reminds me of the Chevy Chase joke from SNL back in the 70s, when he would say, [\u201cGeneralissimo Francisco Franco is still dead.\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalissimo_Francisco_Franco_is_still_dead)",

        "comment": "Hi,\n\nWhen the AP and other news organizations \"call\" an election, they're doing so based on some calculations.\n\nLike the other commenter mentioned, the election is really a bunch of separate states, and they're each called individually. The AP will call those states when they've reached a point where it's almost statistically impossible for that candidate to lose based on the remaining votes and historical trends. So, for example, in a state like Maryland that is overwhelmingly blue, the AP can very very confident after 5% of the vote is in that the state will go to Hillary. Similarly, West Virginia was called almost immediately because the state is overwhelmingly red.\n\nFor closer states, the AP will wait until a large portion of the votes are in, and then look at the difference between the candidates and which counties are left. As an example, if the candidates are 100,000 votes apart, with a few hundred thousand votes left, you make think a comeback is quite possible. But based on which counties those votes are left to come from, it might be easy get a rough estimate of how the votes will break down based on historical data for those counties.\n\nSo they've got statisticians watching this stuff all night. When they feel confident enough about a state (and they have to be really confident because they'll look like total idiots if they call it wrong), they call the state.\n\nOnce the called states push someone over 270 electoral votes, they call the election.

Therefore, the response is that as soon as someone appears to be voting again, they are given a provisional ballot, which will only be counted if there are enough provisional ballots to alter the outcome.

But people who qualify for public housing, it's pretty much a \"here-or-homeless\" choice.  By this measure, the government could pass a law prohibiting unhealthy food in public housing, or unprotected sex in public housing.  It's just too far into the \"nanny state\" for my comfort.",

Because the state itself is large (despite it having a lot of rural areas) the people there have less influence than the states to their North.

The claim that PV is what should be done is because it produces the result most people want, which is fairly common in a fair democracy (yes, I know, republic, but republics can still be democratic, as is the case in the US).\n\n2. Clinton won over 500 counties, not the 50-something it claims here. Trump still won more, but not *as* dramatic as propagandised here.\n\n3. I think you misunderstood me. The EC does not prevent urban areas disempowering rural areas, it in fact makes it worse. Large states with urban areas screw the rural population there. A large urban center can due to FPTP completely suppress the rural areas in a state, because of the state-level elections. It gets worse; a state like Texas where there are plenty of rural areas as well as urban areas have EC votes removed to give to the smaller states. That means the rural population of Texas apparently is less important than the population of say Florida. The EC is based on total population per state, not population density. The idea that small states gain more influence is also odd, considering the candidates mostly visit the swing states, not the small states. Perhaps the most influential state in the US is Florida, because it is a swing state and has a large number of EC votes. It does give small states more influence in the senate, but perhaps that means the EC should be kept in the senate but not in the presidential elections. Abolishing FPTP will incentivise candidates to visit more states and listen to a larger range of people.\n\nEnd-result: Trump did not win the election in some sort of landslide. He won because of the electoral college. The margin between popular vote and electoral vote is over 2 million, which historically hasn't happened since the 19th century.",

        "comment": ">sorry if it is not enough for you\n\nThanks for sending it! What's enough for me should be what's enough for anyone! I just need some facts and data. Looks like there might be some in what you sent. Let's investigate.\n\n\"Voter Fraud Is Real. Here\u2019s The Proof\"\n\nLet's dive into the proof! John Gibbs provides [evidence](http://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/7523867-74/state-voters-pennsylvania) of voter fraud in PA! Oh ... well, if you read the article, it talks about people who are registered to vote in multiple locations. This naturally occurs when people move, and the reason that these few hundred cases are found is because they audit the voting registration rolls to prune out these instances. The article cites a single instance where someone who was double-registered voted twice.\n\nWell, maybe John Gibbs was having an off day and just linked to the article because the title agreed with him and didn't actually read it. He does reference a disturbing problem where [dead people voted in Colorado](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/23/colorado-voter-fraud-revealed-slew-of-ballots-cast/), though. Hmm. Of the dozens of people who were still on the voting rolls after death, there were three dead people who had votes cast in their names. Yep, that's definitely voter fraud! If it were happening a million times as often as the evidence shows, it'd be a big problem.\n\nOh! There's a link to an article that says \"massive voter fraud\" in the title! Unfortunately, the article doesn't reference any actual data or results of an investigation, citing only a \"source.\"\n\n\"These are just some instances of voter fraud we know about. It would be silly to assume cases that have been discovered are the only cases of fraud.\"\n\nIndeed! Let's assume that the amount of fraud shown happens on a 10x scale compared to what can be proven. This would mean that tens of people per state might vote twice, perhaps a few hundred nationwide. That still doesn't reconcile with the millions alleged by conservatives.\n\nThere has to be another source of data for people voting illegally, right? Otherwise, rational people like yourself wouldn't believe such a thing has such a large scale. As John Gibbs says, \"Don\u2019t Let Data Contradict My Narrative,\" but the corollary seems to be, \"Don't Let Lack of Data Contradict My Narrative.\"",

It\u2019s a colossal infrastructure which has taken decades to build up, and which has received preferential investment from the west because it was cheaper, in the short term at least. As a result, western factories closed and workers were marginalised. Now the balance of power is with China. Strategy beats tactics.\nIf you needed any better illustration of the US\u2019s retrograde intentions, look at the promises to keep the coal mines open. An industry from the past. You\u2019d do better building factories to make silicon for solar panels\u200a\u2014\u200aexcept China did that decades ago.

The party needs to figure out where it went wrong and develop strong, forceful messaging that gets asses out of seats and into the streets.  It needs to realize that ceding state and local control to the Republicans was a huge mistake.  Indulging in the blame game will only ensure the dems become more politically irrelevant in the mid-terms.\n\nTrump might be a moronic two-bit hustler gussied up in gold lame and rhinestones, but he knows how to make a sales pitch.

Just yesterday I argued with people who were nonchalant about Trump lying on the campaign trail.\n\nBut the point of running in an election is to convince the people you're the best for the job.  You put out your policy positions, you hope people understand them, but ultimately, you need to do that convincing part.\n\nETA: It comes down to this: effort is required on the part of both the campaign and the electorate.  If the campaign isn't doing its job and hoping to coast to victory to coronate their chosen one, it's their own damn fault if they don't win.  Politics is about messaging.  The Dems suck at it, and I say this as someone very sympathetic to the Dems' social agenda.\n",

I would say, though, that the bulk of responsibility is with the people.  Or, ideally, it should be, and I think our system was set up with this idea in mind.  Campaigns like we have today are a relatively new thing.  Before, it was largely expected of people to do some basic homework on candidates.  \n\nWith this election we saw massive disinformation campaigns.  Fake news.  Crazy allegations.  Furthermore, government policy is complex.  Real solutions can't be condensed into a 20 word sound bite.  Clinton put her policies out there, but they were complex and weren't headline grabbing.  Meanwhile, Trump just repeated a bunch of headliney nonsensical bullshit that people just ate up.  The people have become intellectually lazy and far too cozy in their echo chambers and safe spaces.  This election was the people's fault.  We got what we deserve.  And it isn't going to get any better.  Our attention spans have diminished to that of gnats and our ability to critically think has been reduced to pure garbage.  Problem is, we seem to like it like that.",

        "comment": "Honestly, apologies for the \"troll\" remark altogether.  I try to be civil online, even in the middle of a heated exchange, and I failed at that here.  Nothing's gained by being inflammatory.\n\nI agree; Clinton had some very well-considered positions outlined on her campaign page.  She even had economists of every stripe attesting that her proposals were objectively better for the economy.  I found her positions reasonable and they seemed to be backed up by realistic numbers and facts.\n\nBut again, and this has always been the same (I don't believe in any mythical time in the past when all people did their due diligence because they believed in duty, honor, country...the masses have always been the masses), you have to sell yourself to the people.  Sloganeering has always been a part of that: Zachary Tyler's famous line comes immediately to mind, and I'm having some dim memories of learning about similar sloganeering going back to the Roman Republic in my Latin classes...we translated a lot of orations that were clearly propagandistic in nature and meant to boost one politician over another.\n\nThe internet has definitely exacerbated the ignorance problem (ironic as I remember it was supposed to bring knowledge and enlightenment to all, haha), but that just means a campaign has to work harder to get to the people.  You can have the best plan that will solve every problem in the known universe for the price of a cup of coffee, you can even present objective proof that it would work and even let people try the test at home with some vinegar and a few common household herbs...but if you can't communicate it clearly and concisely to people (and, unfortunately, this means sloganeering and simplification...you just hope the actual substance isn't terribly distorted in presentation), you'll never get a chance to make it happen.\n\nI like Hillary.  I've wanted her for president since '04.  She's a formidably intelligent person, a genuine human being, and has a proven track record of helping the common man.  But for some reason she can't make herself relatable, and like it or not, this is part of politics.  Always has been, always will be.\n\nBelieve me, I'm upset with anyone who voted for the fat orange child rapist.  I had an hourlong argument with my father over President-elect Cheeto earlier this month when I called him to wish him a happy birthday, and it started to get bitter.  People who should have reflected for two seconds before casting their vote are going to see that they've been sold a bill of goods.  I understand the social forces that made this happen (I berate many of my well-to-do liberal friends for casting unthinking blanket aspersions on \"rednecks\" or \"hillbillies\" or the entire state of Texas; that shit just breeds resentment), but I'm still angry at the country for voting against its self-interest.  But...they voted for the person they felt understood their concerns more.  Trump's message might have been brain-dead, it might have all been empty, but he identified what was angering a large part of the electorate and hammered on that relentlessly.  It's classic salesmanship.\n\nI'm rambling here.  I think you and I are generally on the same page regarding responsibility...thanks for responding to me in a substantive way despite my ill-advised \"troll\" taunt.",

If you're going to be labeled a troll, may as well be a high minded one...\n\nI wasn't trying to allude to some fantastical path, but I still believe people, as a necessity, had to do more due dilligence.  I mean, we've had, what? 10 presidents since TV became big, 3 since the internet existed, 15 since radio was popular.  20 during the time of cars.  In the past, people had to search out information, because it wasn't as accessible.  Nationwide campaigning was almost impossible due to travel and time constraints.  The country has changed, media has changed and standards of journalism have changed.  The masses have grown and I cant honestly say that we are any less ignorant than ever before.  In some regards, it appears we have slidden backwards. \n\nFor the life of me I'm trying to remember specifics, but there are a few choice quotes from the founding fathers regarding the burden of the people to be wise in politics and selection of leaders.  The onus is always on the people.  However, a trait of a good leader is effective communication.  Clinton's problem is that she was so effectively under siege that it was hard to get a message out.  Even the GOP had this problem with Trump.  I've heard the analogy before of playing chess with a pigeon who keeps knocking over pieces and shitting on the board and I think it's an apt analogy for this election.  But, the masses tolerated the pigeon crapping all over the game.  They cheered it on and propped it up.  Not giving a thought to what the underlying message was.  Giving into populist rage.  Something, something dark undercurrent of populism in this country, be wary it taping into it.  Well, we just drilled a fucking well into the center of it.

People do have to do their due diligence, and it's sad that many don't.  We're at a time in history when almost everyone in this country carries a device in their pocket that gives them access to almost the entirety of human knowledge, yet they'd rather use those devices to chase cartoon characters or share pictures of every meal that hits their dinner table than try to educate themselves about people who are responsible for running this country.\n\n(And I'm not even going to start in on the people who \"voted for change\" yet let their Senator/Representative back into office....)\n\nIt's interesting, in light of the \"fake news\" thing that's captured our consciousness...before journalistic standards were a thing, people were fed nothing but biased, slanted and opinionated stories in their daily paper/editorial broadside.  I wonder how easy it was to make an informed decisions in such a climate.\n\nClinton was definitely snowed under by trivial accusations (the emails...some of them might have been a little seamy, but that's politics, kiddies...there was nothing incriminating or damning there), but her team had no idea how to shrug it off.  They should have been more prepared to fend off the same-old same-old lobs, as very little was new...Bill's affairs, Benghazi, the emails...the campaign should have had a plan to deal with these obvious lines of attack.",

It's like there was no way that the second most unlikeable candidate in modern US political history who did in fact have a hand in freezing out the better DNC candidate via underhanded insider power moves could lose to the first most unlikeable candidate in modern US political history. It's so hard to wrap their heads around it that they are looking for anything and everything to blame except their candidate herself and the corrupt DNC power structure. This does not bode well for them in the next election. If they can't get their shit together and clean house internally they're in for a lot of disappointment.",

It's not just fingerpointing.\n\nLet me explain something to you about reports on cyberattacks like this one: the \"crime scene\" can't contain evidence pointing towards several suspects (such evidence can't accidentally appear). If there's evidence, it all points towards the same suspect. In this case, Russia.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of real-life investigations, no accusations are usually made because \"it might all be a coincidence\". Often the perpetrator is known but it's kept quiet.\n\nIn this case there is such a mountain of evidence it can't be \"just a coincidence\" anymore. And note that this isn't just the CIA saying it's the Russians, it's the NSA as well as several independent investigators from different political backgrounds too. It's not broadcast by \"the left\", it's broadcast by government intelligence agencies and independent investigators who have no involvement with \"the left\".\n\nWhen \"the left horde\" is \"screaming\" that Russia did it, they're actually right and have hard evidence to back it up. Yet that same \"horde\" isn't also screaming to go to war. Some nutjob might, but they don't represent millions of people.",

There has been no evidence of foreign influence.\n\n> The deals she struck speak to a pay for play/bribery system of the highest order.\n\nThis is a ridiculous statement. Take the uranium deal you mentioned for example. Clinton wasn't actually involved with this deal, and 9 other government bodies also signed off on the deal (the departments of justice, commerce, treasure, homeland security, defense and energy as well as the chief of science and technology policy, the US trade representative and finally the US nuclear regulatory commission). Clinton has no influence on these departments.\n\n> The donations should double, or triple, from countries like Saudi Arabia that seek to augment women's rights around the world...\n\nThe reason Saudi Arabia donates is to keep a good international profile going. It kinda looks good on paper. The CF was a high-profile charity due to Hillary appearing in the news often as a candidate, and therefore the popular choice. Now that that's gone, the CF has disappeared from the foreground, making them far less interesting to donate to if you're interested in putting up a good show.",

        "comment": "Nixon refused to read even the written briefings before taking office. They were all returned, unopened, later on.\n\nAgain, I dislike Trump greatly. I voted against him. We do not know what the daily briefings contain, so we cannot speak to their efficacy, especially if consecutive briefings end up being identical. I\u2019ve also seen nothing saying that Trump does not still receive daily written briefings, whether or not he reads them.\n\nMoreover, Trump is not the president. Obama is still the president, thank God. Obama is also receiving briefings and actually has the authority to do something about them, Trump does not.\n\nEDIT: I think Trump\u2019s pomposity is not in dispute, except by rabid Trump fans. Trump could do a much better job of communicating his reasoning for not attending daily briefings. Maybe he has valid reasons, but he instead comes off like an arrogant ass.\n\nEDIT 2: Furthermore, I think his response, which is typical for him these days, communicates to most of us that he is 1. Not used to this level of scrutiny of his actions, and 2. Not used to this level of criticism of his actions. He is clearly out of his comfort zone when it comes to this scrutiny and criticism and he responds like a trapped wild animal, lashing out because he lacks the proper mental tools to emotionally deflect most of it and be calm, cool and collected. Time will tell if he adapts.",

No special treatment. This would be different if, for instance, there were a policy in place that limited access to the president to only heads of state who would stay at Trump hotels. In such a case, I would absolutely agree with you.  But that is not the case yet. ",

        "comment": "Text copy of https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/this-is-what-happens-when-donald-trump-attacks-a-private-citizen-on-twitter/2016/12/08/a1380ece-bd62-11e6-91ee-1adddfe36cbe_story.html?tid=sm_fb&utm_term=.eb6dbf9d08dc\n\nAbout a year ago, 18-year-old college student Lauren Batchelder stood up at a political forum in New Hampshire and told Donald Trump that she didn\u2019t think he was \u201ca friend to women.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Trump fired back on Twitter \u2014 calling Batchelder an \u201carrogant young woman\u201d and accusing her of being a \u201cplant\u201d from a rival campaign. Her phone began ringing with callers leaving threatening messages that were often sexual in nature. Her Facebook and email inboxes filled with similar messages. As her addresses circulated on social media and her photo flashed on the news, she fled home to hide.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what anyone was going to do,\u201d said Batchelder, now 19, who has never discussed her experience with a reporter until now. \u201cHe was only going to tweet about it and that was it, but I didn\u2019t really know what his supporters were going to do, and that to me was the scariest part.\u201d\n\nThis is what happens when Trump targets a private citizen who publicly challenges him.\n\nWhen Trump tweeted about Batchelder in October 2015, he had fewer than 5 million followers; he now has more than 17 million and has bragged that having a Twitter account is \u201clike owning the New York Times without the losses.\u201d Twitter has become Trump\u2019s cyber-magic wand, allowing him to quickly act on a fleeting idea, a fit of anger or something he sees on television. Now that he is the president-elect, the power of Trump\u2019s tweets has only increased.\n\nWith one tweet, Trump can change headlines on cable news, move financial markets or cause world leaders to worry. With one tweet last week, Trump inflamed a conflict with China. With another tweet on Tuesday, Trump caused Boeing stock to plummet. With a third on Wednesday night, Trump prompted a series of threatening calls to the home of a union leader who had called him a liar.\n\nAlthough Trump said months ago that he was likely to give up Twitter if elected, he has shown little sign of doing so. He will soon inherit the @POTUS account, which has 12.5 million followers.\n\n\u201cI think I am very restrained, and I talk about important things,\u201d Trump said during an interview with the \u201cToday\u201d show this week. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a modern-day form of communication. .\u2009.\u2009. I get it out much faster than a press release. I get it out much more honestly than dealing with .\u2009.\u2009. dishonest reporters. So many reporters are dishonest.\u201d\n\nFor Batchelder, who studies history and gender studies at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H, the abuse continues more than a year later. Five days before the election, she received a Facebook message that read: \u201cWishing I could f---ing punch you in the face. id then proceed to stomp your head on the curb and urinate in your bloodied mouth and i know where you live, so watch your f---ing back punk.\u201d\n\nDuring her first semester at Saint Anselm in fall 2015, Batchelder decided to volunteer for former Florida governor Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign, even though her views were much more liberal than his. To her, it was just an enjoyable opportunity to learn more about the Republican Party. She listed the volunteer position on her online r\u00e9sum\u00e9 but later realized that she truly is a Democrat.\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2015, Batchelder attended a bipartisan forum in Manchester and said to Trump: \u201cSo, maybe I\u2019m wrong, maybe you can prove me wrong, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a friend to women.\u201d\n\nTrump defended himself, saying he gave women positions of power at his construction sites, has influential women in his life and will fund women\u2019s health initiatives.\n\n\u201cI love women, I respect women, I cherish women,\u201d Trump said at one point.\n\nBatchelder asked for the microphone again.\n\n\u201cI want to get paid the same as a man, and I think you understand that, so if you become president, will a woman make the same as a man, and do I get to choose what I do with my body?\u201d she said, then threw her arms up in a questioning gesture.\n\nTrump answered curtly: \u201cYou\u2019re going to make the same if you do as good of a job, and I happen to be pro-life, okay?\u201d\n\nCNN and other media outlets covered the striking exchange, which generated conversation online. But Batchelder went to bed that night thinking her moment in the spotlight was over.\n\nAfter midnight, Trump\u2019s director of social media tweeted out screengrabs of Batchelder\u2019s social-media accounts. Trump\u2019s supporters launched investigations of their own. At 7:39 a.m., Trump tweeted: \u201cThe arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at No Labels yesterday was a Jeb staffer! HOW CAN HE BEAT RUSSIA & CHINA?\u201d\n\nLater that morning, Trump tweeted again: \u201cHow can Jeb Bush expect to deal with China, Russia + Iran if he gets caught doing a \u2018plant\u2019 during my speech yesterday in NH?\u201d\n\nTim Miller, Bush\u2019s former spokesman, said the campaign had nothing to do with Batchelder\u2019s asking the question. While the staff was accustomed to Trump\u2019s attacking Bush, they were stunned that he went after a college student.\n\n\u201cIf I was going to plant a question, I would have planted a better question,\u201d Miller said Thursday.\n\nBatchelder agreed: \u201cWhy would they ever send me out to do a pro-choice question? Guys, [Bush] is pro-life, which was one of my biggest problems with the Republican Party. And so I was like: \u2018Why would they ever send me to do that?\u2019\u201d\n\nLogic doesn\u2019t matter to online trolls, who rated Batchelder\u2019s physical appearance, threatened to rape or otherwise hurt her and called her vulgar names. A photoshopped picture popped up online depicting her face covered in semen.\n\n\u201cI love social media, but I also saw the terrible side of social media,\u201d she said. \u201cI definitely tried to focus on something else because when you\u2019re seeing your life being played out in front of you and people are judging it and people are making assumptions about you, you kind of just want to stay away.\u201d\n\nBatchelder turned down interview requests, ignored the nasty messages and threw herself into playing rugby. She became even more interested in women\u2019s issues and wants to be a human rights lawyer. She voted for Hillary Clinton for president.\n\nTrump\u2019s Twitter account says it was created in March 2009, but Trump really started to use the account as a key communication tool in 2012 when he seriously considered running for president, said longtime friend Roger Stone.\n\n\u201cHe loves it,\u201d Stone said Thursday. \u201cThis is what got him elected \u2014 being outspoken.\u201d\n\nTrump dictates many of his tweets to \u201cone of the young ladies\u201d who work in his office.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019ll type it out for me, real fast, bring it in \u2014 I\u2019ll be in a meeting. \u2018Blah, blah, blah, boom!\u2019 Put an exclamation point here, and they\u2019ll send it out,\u201d Trump said in a May interview on Fox News.\n\nBut on weekends, evenings and during early-morning hours \u2014 such as when the first tweet about Batchelder was posted \u2014 Trump says he writes and sends his own tweets. The messages will often come seconds or minutes after the topic is covered on a major news network. Melania Trump said during an April town hall with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that she has repeatedly told her husband to get off Twitter, especially after midnight.\n\n\u201cAnderson, if he would only listen,\u201d she said. \u201cI did many times. And I just say: \u2018Okay, do whatever you want.\u2019 He\u2019s an adult. He knows the consequences.\u201d\n\nBatchelder hopes that Trump stops targeting people on Twitter, especially people such as she who are not public figures, and uses Twitter as President Obama has. She realizes that speaking out is likely to spark another wave of abuse, but she thinks it\u2019s important for people to realize the harm that a single tweet can cause.\n\n\u201cTwitter is such a powerful platform. He can make a difference. He can change the world,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, using Twitter, I think he should use it for good. I think he should use it to uplift others.\u201d",

        "comment": "I think you didn't read the article properly.\n\nLet's analyse this article from October 30th, 2015 and establish a timeline to get the right perspective:\n\n - Early 2015: Exxon stops funding the Clinton Foundation.\n\n - July 8th, 2015: UCS publishes documents revealing that Exxon scientists have been studying global warming since 1981 and knew about the adverse effects CO2 emissions could have, but dismissed it as \"murky science\".\n\n - October 9th, 2015: The Energy and Environmental Reporting project did new research on the gap between Exxon Mobil's public stance on climate change and their actual actions. It's revealed that Exxon was aware of even more than previously thought, including the danger global warming poses to the arctic. They discovered this by reviewing scientific material and interviewing experts (including former Exxon employees).\n\n - October 29th, 2015: After being asked about it by Jordan Cichon (local event organiser), Clinton says she supports a DOJ investigation on Exxon, joining Gov. Martin O'Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders, citing that the newly found evidence would be reason enough to at least investigate them.\n\nAlso note a couple of other things:\n\n - At this point, Clinton is not SoS anymore and hasn't been for over 2 years. While she may support the investigation, she can't actually start it or influence it in any way. She's no longer involved with the US government, other than being a presidential candidate.\n\n - Exxon Mobil wasn't the only company to stop donating. They were joined by Samsung, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and PWC. \n\n - While Exxon may not be donating as a company anymore, several Exxon employees and board members did still donate, and two board members were featured at the CF conference in 2015.\n\n - The linked article fails to mention why Exxon stopping their donations 9 months earlier than the Clinton call for an investigation bears any relevance. Curiously, the cited article (see \"new call\" in the third paragraph of your article) on the new call doesn't mention it, but does mention the board members that do still donate to the foundation. I quote from this article:\n> But Clinton\u2019s call is a bit more surprising, considering that lobbyists for ExxonMobil have donated to and bundled money for her campaign. According to Mother Jones, ExxonMobil lobbyist Davis Leiter has bundled $36,550 for Clinton\u2019s campaign. The company\u2019s top Washington lobbyist Theresa Fariello has also given the maximum $2,700 to Clinton\u2019s campaign, as did Washington-based Exxon attorney Judith Batty.\n\nSo there indeed is nothing suspicious to find here.",

Can I blame them? Hardly. We practically asked for it. Trump literally asked for it.\n\nI think we're being really unfair to the GOP by focusing so much on Comey and Putin. They deserve most of the credit. Remembers all those things they've been attacking for years and decades? Things like the legitimacy of elections, the trustworthiness of the press, and functional government. There's a word for those things: democracy.\n\nDemocracy is worth standing up for even at it's worst. And, ironically, right now that means letting Trump become president. It's crazy, but that's part of the deal. Democracy works best because it's the best-known political analog for the human soul. The same freedom that allows people to makes mistakes... to be fooled... indifferent... also allows them to better themselves and their society. ",

My vote was not \"hacked.\" \n\nThe election must stand as it is as even if you accept the ludicrous Liberal argument of \"hacking our choices\" the fact remains that MANY voted against Clinton with NO evidence the leaks made the decision for them at all.\n\nAnd how did the Russians manage to hack all but the folk sampled by the pollsters? When did such hacking occur - in the 12 hours prior to the vote closing? But then what of the early voters? Did the pollsters just flat out lie? I am sorry, but if the Russians swayed the election via our minds then the polls should have shown that.

Podesta fell victim to a phishing scheme and lost a cellphone in a cab; Russians need not apply.\n\nBy twisting do you mean the emails were altered, because that is fake news. They are authentic.\n\nI understand you feel upset that the leaks were just DNC and Podesta. Life is tough some times.\n\nThe important issue is the disturbing content within the emails. Did they ruin Clinton's campaign? No, she did that herself.\n\nQuestion: the leaks started well before the vote. The polls continued to show Clinton dominating up until election day. If the leaks were so powerful why did the polls not detect their influence?",

Most people have not  even read the quote and think it's something nefarious instead of a Frank discussion on the realities of politics. I challenge you to present that quote in full and tell me what's wrong with it. There is nothing in those emails that Republicans aren't equally guilty of.\n\nFinally, I'm aware of what Assange claims regarding his source.\n Frankly I don't believe him and there is zero evidence to believe him.",

(LGBT folks, Muslim Americans, Latin Americans, ect)\n\nFor an LGBT child, finding out their siblings, or parents, voted for someone who is surrounding themselves with advisors who view LGBT people (and the lives they lead) as diseased, immoral, or insane is a pretty big blow. It feels like a personal attack instead of a difference of political opinion.\n\nImagine being a Muslim American, and having your president-elect declare you and people like you to be potential terrorists simply for practicing a faith that has been used as a cover by groups of extremists for their acts of atrocity. There are plenty of terrorists who claim to be Christians, but we don't treat all Christians as if they were terrorists.\n\nImagine being married to a first-generation immigrant from Mexico and hearing the people who make the laws describe your spouse as a \"criminal, rapist, and drug dealer\". Imagine how you would feel when they come home in tears because one of their co-workers yelled at them go back where they came from, and they are just a leech draining the work of REAL Americans.\n\nMost right-wingers would still feel relatively safe in their ability to have homes, healthcare, and a place in American life and society even if liberals or progressives were in charge. The same cannot be said for the reverse. When people argue for legislation that enables folks to fire you for who you love, or to put you on a registry because of your faith, how are you supposed to pretend like everything is fine?\n\nAlso I've had over half of my conservative family disown and disavow anything to do with me because I am LGBT. So it isn't like folks on the \"left\" are the only ones who draw lines in the sand. For some conservatives that line is being gay, or marrying a black person, or what have you. For liberals it looks like that line is voting for someone who openly encourages white supremacists, surrounds himself with anti-gay politicians, appoints a cabinet almost entirely composed of old super-rich white dudes, and disrespects women.\n\nThere needs to be healing and reconciliation, for sure. But I don't think saying \"Well look, you guys are being unreasonable! At least WE are wiling to sit down and be happy\" is the right way to do it. People where upset when Obama became president. A lot of those folks are still upset he was president. Calls for people to just \"calm down\" about Obama didn't work then, and it won't work now when it is going the other direction. ",

I have friends who are friends 1st, and oh yes they also happen to be 1 or several of those categories. Point being they are not selected nor rejected as a friend based upon their other characteristics.\n\nThe point with immigration is ILLEGAL immigrants. One should never discuss immigration without that qualifier as that makes all the difference. Trump opposes illegal immigration - these are folk that have broken the law by illegal entry. The issue needs to be resolved, but simply letting them stay in sanctuary cities and ignoring it is unwise. Is deportation the proper step, or can a pathway to citizenship be made (e.g., change our laws) - I am uncertain, but simply ignoring it is allowing the law to remain unfulfilled.\n\nI have not disowned anyone for their religious, political beliefs, or sexual orientation.

Of course, the Washington Examiner is also a relatively biased source; so I looked for their source of information. They link to the Center for Immigration Studies' website -- not a study. So, I did some research, and discovered that the Center for Immigration Studies is funded by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The Federation for American Immigration Reform has a goal of reducing both legal and illegal immigration. So, even if  the Center for Immigration Studies has a study showing that Obama has refused to deport 820,000 illegal immigrants guilty of murder, rape, drug offenses, and other crimes; I'm sure that study is biased. With all of that said, if anyone has an actual source of the information presented in these \"news\" articles, please provide the source. Thanks :)",

Let Japan and South Korea have nukes? Are you kidding me?\n\nNot to mention his incessant tweeting which has already cost Lockheed Martin to lose millions in stocks because their planes are \"expensive\". Like no shit Sherlock, it's a flying death machine with no equal in the world. It's gonna be expensive.\n\nThat's not even to touch on his possible signs of corruption from letting his daughter ivanka sit in with him during his meeting Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, getting licenses pushed through for his hotels expediently after meeting with Latin American leaders, and his unwillingness to give us his damn tax returns like every president since Nixon has done. \n\nAnd finally, he's just a shitty man child. He insulted a family who lost a child in the fight against terrorism, he's called a POW a loser (McCain), and he's tried to get an old lady evicted from her house so he could build a casino. He is literally cartoon levels of evil and stupid.\n\nI ask you, with all sincerity, why? Why did you think this man was the right choice for this country?",

He lost because he lost the South.  That was pretty much the end for him.  Most Southern states are open primaries.  30 million voted in Dem primary, even if you add 6%, that only makes up 1.8 million voters to him, and he still loses by 1.5 million.

        "comment": "These are bad ideas.  1 campaign finance is how we've gotten into the rotten system we have now.  It was all campaign finance laws that lead to what we have now.  2 political parties are better than nothing.  They empower and mobilize ordinary citizens.  3 is the electoral college which always gets trashed when a candidate you don't like gets through.  The modern output of the idea is that it gets money and campaigns on the national level to actually work around the country to some degree but also to be able to strategically save some amount of money.  Beyond that the electoral college makes elections not run entirely towards a certain sort of american, urban center dwellers, doesn't end up with the majority of the power.  It's easy to buy the votes of urban areas as well.  \n\nHere's what's actually happening with the government.  There are different types of people who are emotionally built differently.  One group of people is more right-wing and the other left.  There are other types of people but what matters is these two.  Bad things happen when they both aren't listened to.  Basically neither idea is \"right\" all the time but when they aren't being listened to the people start to get sick.  If the people on the right don't get listened to you'll see them move more to the right, at least historically, and you'll see fascism sweep in.  When you look at the history of all these movements starting in the early 20th century that lead to really bad governments were met with open arms by the people.  \n\nTo understand this stuff most directly we need to think of our government as having an effect on the mental and emotional wellbeing of people.  The optimal flow is a passage of power back and forth between these ideas that work for people.  Sometimes the right wing ideas are needed and sometimes the left but the thing is if we get rid of the electoral college that's going to harm one of the balancing factors.  \n\nIf you want to see things get better it's not changing everything it's just to grow up ourselves and accept that the government is a compromise for the benefit of the people.  If we can't find a middle ground things will get worse so always support that.  We won't ever live in an ideal world but we shouldn't pretend that the one we have is terrible.  \n\nAnd the thing about people voting for change was bogus.  Obama was a fake and he uppped the illegal NSA spying, upped drones, and didn't actually have any noticeable effect on making the world a better place.  Am I happy about Trump?  No.  I can't stand the stuff he's said.  But if people keep wanting a messiah that's all you'll get.  Obama was a fabulist as well.  That's really all a president is.  It's like this story we tell ourselves to feel OK with the world.  And that's OK.  But as always if you want to change things just ask yourself if you think these people can be trusted changing things.  ",

We could safely ignore you and deal with the world as it is; that takes a combination of rationality and empathy. Social Justice is a large part of having a civilization and avoiding civil wars. (Which are rude and most uncivil.)\n\nI think, sadly, the popular vote margin in favor of Clinton is a better measure. I don't think the number of racists is that small (though nowhere near half the population, either.) If we lump the racists, extremists and trolls all together, though, we are getting close to the number of people needed to cause a war. Thirty percent is really all that it takes; thirty percent and a willingness to be violent and indifferent to the desires, wishes and needs of those on the \"other side.\"\n\nThat's what it takes to start one. To see what it takes to end one, I refer you to Generals Sherman, Grant, Montgomery and Eisenhower - and all the boffins and eggheads that developed the various \"killer apps\" needed to get the job done - like The Monitor and the Atomic Bomb. \n\nIt also requires that there actually be an \"other side.\" So \"othering\" people in order to dismiss their views as unimportant/evil is pretty important to starting wars. Collective effort is what it takes to end one. \n\nThat's why I tell myself that racists are citizens too; and they need universal health care just as badly as the people they want to deny it to due to misguided racist ideals. Health care and good education for their children, lest another generation be lost. That's why there's really no \"war on Christmas,\" and Christians in the US aren't actually persecuted. It's not like there aren't a bunch of leftards who *would* think of that as a good idea - but we generally SIT on those people.\n\nPretty much like Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckley did to the John Birch Society, back in the day when Conservatives were the smart people. \n",

Mencken](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken)\n\nJust in case you think Mencken was some sort of antique SJW cuck, he's also noted for having said this, circa 1910.\n\n>\"I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it. The educated negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a negro. He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization. And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him.\"\n\nThat sounds rather like something you'd find on Stormfront. So he wouldn't have been offended by racism, *per se.* Or eugenics, for that matter.  Both were common matters of faith at the time, even among the otherwise intelligent. No, no; what bothered him were dangerous populist appeals to the weaponized ignorance of the Common Man - he thought people like William Jennings Bryon should be tarred, feathered and run out of town. \n\n>Progress: The process whereby the human race has got rid of whiskers, the vermiform appendix and God.\n\n>    A Book of Burlesques (1916)\n\nHe was something of a cynic. As well as being a hopeless optimist.\n\nOh, he was a conservative who thought FDR was the devil incarnate. We'd hardly agree on anything - other than an ideal that any possible point of agreement would have to be founded in honest fact. Or to quote him:\n\n\n>    The final test of truth is ridicule. Very few dogmas have ever faced it and survived. Huxley laughed the devils out of the Gadarene swine. Not the laws of the United States but the mother-in-law joke brought the Mormons to surrender. Not the horror of it but the absurdity of it killed the doctrine of infant damnation. But the razor edge of ridicule is turned by the tough hide of truth. How loudly the barber-surgeons laughed at Huxley\u2014and how vainly! What clown ever brought down the house like Galileo? Or Columbus? Or Darwin? . . . They are laughing at Nietzsche yet . . .\n        \"On Truth\" in Damn! A Book of Calumny (1918), p. 53\n\nAnd that's why I have stocked up on popcorn. Because the entire Trump Train is fucking high-speed absurdity. Dangerously well-armed, to be sure. But clearly incapable of governing - to a degree that makes GWB look competent. I was paying attention, and the last credible voices arguing in favor of the GWB vision faded out around 2004. Even [Little Green Footballs](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/) came around in the end. But man, back in the day; Saddam was Satan and he damn well DID have WMD *somewhere.*\n\nSo. You have successfully driven all the smart people away. You've made it ok to ignore reality and make wishful thinking a means of determining policy and balancing the budget.\n\nExcuse me.

OTOH, it didn't alarm me as much as Trump's opening up the door to a new nuclear arms race. \n\nOne of the things about Hillary that I disliked - but respected - was her calculating nature. So on the whole, I figured that she was going to calculate carefully in service of her Neocon agenda. Which I did not like even more, but figured was unlikely to result in anything very *different* for four years. Four years to build a better progressive movement seemed to be a good thing, and Clinton being the living embodiment of the reason it was needed. \n\nBut Trump is probably better incentive. He's willing to say and do things that alarm complacent liberals just for fun, and if he doesn't say it, one of you lot will. You guys seem to think pissing off liberals for fun is a good idea, that we are simply too \"diverse\" to do anything about it. In doing so, you rub our noses in what we have been trying to politely tolerate. Problems coastal liberals have been ignoring for far too long, I would say. I think four years of being subjected to the values of [Dumbfuckistan](http://www.attn.com/stories/7274/ian-gurvitz-welcome-to-dumbfuckistan-q-and-a) will clarify positions remarkably well. \n\nAssuming the US survives. And that is a non-trivial question.\n\n>EC is good to keep the CA votes in check. Illegals voting should not decide anything.\n\nYou see, it's not the politics, or even the racism; It's the breathtaking stupidity. The other things come from that, they don't cause it. It's voluntary, cultural stupidity. You have started a cultural war - and Trump is now your general. It's sort of a cultural sorting mechanism. \n\nYou could pick up your phone, look into the matter and see if there's any detectable percentage of \"illegals\" voting. There isn't, by the way. Unless you count ethnic Latinos as \"illegals.\" But you choose to believe something that's not only false, but *ridiculous,* something anyone with the willingness to check can disprove in a simple search - and you state it as if it's a fact. Maybe you believe it, maybe you don't, it doesn't seem to matter from what I can see. \n\nIt's not true. And your \"opinion\" that it's a fact isn't a political opinion. We can't \"agree to disagree.\" You can hate on Mexicans all you like, as far as I care. But undocumented people cannot and do not vote. It would be stupid. It's a really good way to get your ass deported. There aren't enough idiot Mexicans to make any sort of difference, no way to organize it without getting caught immediately. It would be *stupid* to try and rig an election that way.\n\nNow, if you want to know how to rig an election - head on over to [BlackBoxVoting.org](http://blackboxvoting.org/). It's likely that a good amount of jiggery-pokery happened, given how easy and undetectable it is. But it doesn't involve busing undocumented aliens to the polls. They aren't conspicuously part of the political establishment of either party - and you need some kind of access to get to the machines and some sort of computer literacy to hack them. And - this is the critical part - they'd have to give a flying crap, one way or the other. I can't imagine that they would. Trump or Clinton is Hobson's choice from their point of view.\n\nAnyway. Cultural warfare. I think it's time to fall back on a quote.\n\n[\"Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end.

Bernie has done a huge service for the forces of change, for liberalism, for moving the political framing to the left, but significant change always takes time. If you pull the wrong strategy, the ones ending up with the change will be on the right instead of the left.

As a private seller, I'd require that, plus ID. \n\nOut of the private sales I've done in the last year - only 1 has not required me to show my weapons permit. The one that didn't was to purchase a fucking muzzleloader. Federal law doesn't ban felons from owning muzzleloaders - but my state's law DOES ban them from owning muzzys. \n\nBanning online sales between private citizens will only make it harder for me, a non felon, to buy guns.

What theory have you discovered that discredits and replaces the law of supply and demand? Considering:\n\n>Wrong. Minimum wage has little to no effect on job loss..never has.\n\n-4 Do you even read any of the sources you post or have seen posted?",

The problem is it doesn't address your claim that raising the MW causes job loss. \n\n>The typical minimum wage worker is not a high school student earning weekend pocket money. In fact, 89 percent of those who would benefit from a federal minimum wage increase to $12 per hour are age 20 or older, and 56 percent are women.\n\nYour second link also deals with **YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT...not losses from raising the MW**. Neither of them show any Appreciable  loss even in youth unemployment any time the wage has been raised.\n\n\nYou got one thing right we are done with this if you can't show one time where your **THEORY** ever came to volition. Because this is about history show me one time since 1930 that MW caused job loss not a 1% loss in a subset of teenagers or shut up and this time keep the insults to yourself. ",

He tells us that the sacrificial victim was painted blue. Next, the victim was led to the summit of the pyramid and laid over a stone alter. Then with his arms and legs firmly held by the chacs, the nacom cut open the chest and tore out his heart. This was usually done with an obsidian or flint knife. Next, the heart was handed to the high priest, and the body was thrown down the temple stairs.\n\n> Other methods of sacrifice included drowning, beating, mutilation, and arrow sacrifices. In the arrow sacrifice the victim was painted blue, and tied to a stake while dancers took turns trying to pierce the victims heart.\n\n> During the Toltec-Itza rule of Chichen Itza pilgrims would travel great distances in order to perform human sacrifices. The victims who were sometimes laden in gold, silver and precious stones were hurled into the Sacred Cenote, a deep pool of water where the god Chac was said to live. \n\nWell, and pretty much [all around the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice).",

Drones are the only armament which could realistically level the playing field between citizens and a tyrannical government, and they *have* taken our drones away by recently reclassifying them as aircraft, and placing them under FAA jurisdiction, which organization is now developing much stricter rules to govern their use, along with the requirement of a pilot's license for even casual public use. \n\nGuns can't do much in technological warfare. Drones can. They know that. And while we're distracted by gun nonsense (seriously, we can 3D print guns now; there is *no* realistic means of confiscating them from the people), they took our drones.

        "comment": "I know you haven't seen the movie, but some of the things the article complains about are actually done to make it less like propaganda. There was no political tone to the movie; the CIA \"chief\" is scapegoated specifically to avoid blaming Hilary or the administration. \n\nThe movie never \"explicitly\" says that the reason air support never came was \"military incompetence\". It's reportedly said that it's because they're not supposed to be there. \n\nHonestly this article portrays a far more biased view of the movie than the movie does of the situation. Bay did a very good job avoiding politics in my opinion. And the movie was definitely not to hype up the war effort. It wasn't a rah-rah U.S.A kind of thing. The main characters aren't even U.S. Military; they're contractors. \n\nThe article claims that they focus on Obama and Hilary, but Hilary is mentioned zero times, and Obama is never mentioned by name, with the only quote relating to him being someone saying in the background that \"POTUS will be briefed\". Honestly it seems like the author saw this political slant because he went into the movie expecting to find it. It was really absent from the movie and he's making some big leaps to make it into propaganda. Most of his argument is based on assumptions that I certainly didn't make when watching the movie and only a cynical person looking for those exact things would find. ",

You'll hear a lot from the media about certain politicians, but you need to consider that those media organizations are corporations and they benefit from ratings and taxes and presidential policies as much as the next guy.\n\nI would suggest checking out [ISideWith](https://www.isidewith.com/political-quiz), they have a number of questions that you rate *your* beliefs on (so try to be as honest as possible) and once you've completed the 20ish questions it gives you a bunch of information with which party, and potential candidate you most align with.  It also gives you the ability to modify your decisions further by giving some more weight than others, so say for example you care a lot more about the environment than you do about foreign aid you can but more emphasis on the calculations used and while your answers haven't changed, the people you align with the closest might.\n\nI'm sure there are other tools like ISideWith out there, but it might be a good lauching point.\n\nGood luck, and good for you for getting interested in politics -- you have a lot of power with your voice, don't forget that come election day.",

I don't know, man...I really don't. As a youth, I had a lot of faith in the supreme court...they always seemed to rule in a fair and consistent way... the partisanship it has given way to and the citizens united decision have both deflated my trust that they're different that the other two branches... that for ideology or for money, they've been bought and paid for...\n\nThe Mason quote as a single sentence does seem to be wrong...the complete quote seems to be:\n\nForty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British parliament was advised by am artful man, [Sir William Keith] who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people.

This was about white people being able to own black people.  People now are allowed to own dogs but you arn't allowed to rape your dog or beat it to death, back then you were allowed to do that to slaves.\n\nIt isn't just me who says that the civil war was about slavery, the confederates said it was about slavery.  For example Here is a quote from Texas' document called \"A declaration of the causes which impel the State of Texas to secede\nfrom the Federal Union\"\n\n\"Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated States to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquillity and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery--the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits--a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? \"\n\nThere was no previous meaning to the confederate flag, it has always been about owning people.",

To assume that people from the south in those days were all lining up solely to defend slavery at the cost of their lives, when for the simple soldier it was about defending honor, family, culture and self-determinism. The war writ large was about slavery, sure, no one denies that, and the flag has certainly been appropriated by neo-nazis and other racists. But to those who had family die in the conflict it is also a symbol of independence, of heritage, of history. The forces of freedom won, slavery is gone; no one flying the stars and bars on their gunrack is trying to bring slavery back. To them it's a reminder to the people who would tell them how to live that doing so has had and will have a terrible price. I'm certainly not going to fly the fucking thing, but I don't attach the automatic condemnation of racism to it any more than I would if someone my age (40's) had an old tattoo of the General Lee from Dukes of Hazzard - it was something we grew up with, it was our culture, and it means different things to different people.",

I am sure that there were a million reasons for these guys to join the confederate forces but these people knew what slavery was, it was going on all around them and they knew that their state seceded to prolong slavery in much the same way that the people living around Buchenwald knew what that black smoke was coming out of the smokestacks at the camp.\n\n3.

        "comment": "Their own writing explicitly said they were seceding because of slavery.  This is completely plain and clear from their own writing.  They wrote that they were doing it because of slavery and then they had what they wrote republished in newspapers at the time. \n\nHere is why Georgia said that they were seceding:  \"Our Northern confederates, after a full and calm hearing of all the facts, after a fair warning of our purpose not to submit to the rule of the authors of all these wrongs and injuries, have by a large majority committed the Government of the United States into their hands. The people of Georgia, after an equally full and fair and deliberate hearing of the case, have declared with equal firmness that they shall not rule over them. A brief history of the rise, progress, and policy of anti-slavery and the political organization into whose hands the administration of the Federal Government has been committed will fully justify the pronounced verdict of the people of Georgia. The party of Lincoln, called the Republican party, under its present name and organization, is of recent origin. It is admitted to be an anti-slavery party. While it attracts to itself by its creed the scattered advocates of exploded political heresies, of condemned theories in political economy, the advocates of commercial restrictions, of protection, of special privileges, of waste and corruption in the administration of Government, anti-slavery is its mission and its purpose. By anti-slavery it is made a power in the state. The question of slavery was the great difficulty in the way of the formation of the Constitution.\"\n\nMississippi: \n\n\"In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.\n\nOur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few facts will sufficiently prove.\" \n\nSouth Carolina:\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: \"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\n\nThis stipulation was so material to the compact, that without it that compact would not have been made. The greater number of the contracting parties held slaves, and they had previously evinced their estimate of the value of such a stipulation by making it a condition in the Ordinance for the government of the territory ceded by Virginia, which now composes the States north of the Ohio River.\"\n\nTexas:\n\n\"Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them?\"\n\n\nDo you detect a pattern?",

Biologists are more leftwing, on average, than chemists, which are more leftwing than physicists, and which in turn are more leftwing than engineers (of any stripe).\n\nPPs.  I grant you this though -- the Left has captured the academic world, totally, just like Gramsci said they should.

But to *model* it you have to understand hydrology (the flow of water through the atmosphere and oceans, primarily).  This mathematical modelling is difficult, and the results are hugely uncertain.  Do you know what fraction of the Earth's Green House Effect is caused by water in the atmosphere?\n\nSince the scientific principles are well understood, there is scientific consensus that there must be a signal in the temperature data.  However, predicting its size is anyone's guess.  5C?  0.01C?  I do not think anyone knows (and those who do are arrogant).\n\nSo no, if you walk around in Physics or Engineering Departments or Companies, and you ask this question from Conservatives, you will find that they conceded that Antropogenic Warming is real.  They might be more careful about the size of the effect.  For what it is worth, I believe this may be a problem, but we have far bigger and more imminent problems facing humanity.\n\nLet me repeat my question to you:  What fraction of the Green House Effect is due to H2O in the atmosphere, and what fraction is due to CO2, or C4H?\n\n    *Is environmentalism itself a conservative position?*\nConservative, conservation.  Does it rhyme?  Almost all conservatives I know are appalled by trophy hunting, and were so already 30 years ago.  Do you know that the first large National Park on Earth was founded in South Africa in the 1880s by one President Paul Kruger, a Calvinist Puritan of such conservative views that you would want him executed on the spot.  You should now look at who introduced conservation measures in the USA, and what their politics were.\n\nIt is red herring and a Alinskian tactic to somehow claim that conservatism is anti-conservation and wants to shoot dead nice white bunnies.  Standard tactics of the Left.\n\n    *Is acceptance of evolution a conservative position?*\nSome religious fundamentalists reject evolution (which is a process, and not a theory).  This is not main stream Western conservatism, and certainly in the cohort we talk about (scientists) a view which is almost non-existent.  Again, by talking that Conservatives reject Evolution, a convenient smear is developed to defeat conservatism.

Sander's proposed plans. This article is from around the same time as the one mentioned in the OP (Late September compared to mid October)\n\nhttp://reverbpress.com/politics/economics/robert-reich-explains-sanders-policies-cost-america-nothing-video/\n\nWe live in a nation where the specter of Communism/Socialist has been used as a boogeyman for generations. But, Sanders is neither of those things. He is a Democratic Socialist, in the same vein as FDR. Many important aspects of American life are socialist (highways, national parks, social security, medicare, medicaid). None of those things have broken or ruined our economy.\n\nConsider both articles, and go out and do research before making your conclusions either way. If you are concerned about the economy (who isn't?) then look into academic studies, and try to read as many varying viewpoints as possible so you can make an informed opinion on this issue.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this!",

Democratic Socialism doesn't think capitalism is evil either, but they do believe that the government needs to watch dog both business and government itself because of what I said above. Oil subsidies and Agricultural subsidies are good examples also. \n\nWe don't really have a disagreement. What we are arguing about is the source of the same problem we want to solve. You can't believe it's government alone that causes the problem. It's more about status quo anything, government or business trying to defend it's position by changing the laws to favor them instead of stepping up to the challenges presented by a changing world. It's the short term thinking that bottom line immediate profit, or political position, is the most important thing in the universe and must be defended at any cost, even if it's the future of humanity or even themselves. The whole concept that business should be allowed to operate without paying for the space that they operate in through taxation is that kind of shortsighted thinking. The idea that government is inept and doomed to deliver poorly is bullshit. Of course it will if it's operating capital is taken away by crony tax cuts and subsidies designed to favor, again, the status quo larger businesses. The same thing applies to politicians and bureaucratic establishments that will defend their existence far beyond having any valid function. Gerrymandering and voter suppression are also examples of that. We're living in maybe the most corrupt US society ever at an incredibly perilous time in history when humanity has to either grow up or die in it's own waste like a petulant child.  It's a both/and problems not an either/or. Both government and business need to pay attention to what's happening around them and either participate in the \"end of days\" or changing that inevitable future into something else entirely. ",

This is ignoring too the controversies with Oil for Food (inc where Hussein essentially withheld supplied aid) and the postwar regional disparities that undermine the whole narrative re sanctions.

        "comment": "After the New Hampshire primary, I have one big question for Progressives.  It's easy to say what we want - single payer health care, free college tuition, and so on.  The harder question isn't how to make any of those things happen, but what don't we want?  Or maybe it would be better to phrase it as what don't we want to be?\n\nOf course there's an obvious answer to that, isn't there?  The Tea Party.  Ideological, radical, driven by rage and hatred, willing to burn the nation to the ground just to spite President Obama - The Tea Party pretty much embodies how dysfunctional our politics have become, don't you think?\n\nBut what defines the Tea Party?  What makes it what it is?  It's not wanting lower taxes on everyone, especially the wealthy - Donald Trump has proven that.  It's not opposition muscular government regulation either.  We've long known that the conservative christian wing of the Tea Party is more than happy to see a big government - so long as it's enforcing their social agenda.  Similarly business interests are more than happy to see stiff regulation on things like unions and lawsuits against corporations.  So what is it that makes the Tea Party the Tea Party?\n\nI'd suggest it's simply this: they are a minority of the nation who think that they're the majority.  As far as the Tea Party is concerned, they're the \"real\" America, and their political opponents are nefarious characters trying to steal away \"their\" country.  In short, they don't acknowledge the legitimacy of any political view other than their own.  Any political opposition to them is disloyal, un-American, or worse.  In short, they're authoritarians who think they should be in charge and no one else should have a say.\n\nDemocracy means the rule of the people.  *All* of the people, not just the people that agree with you or that you like, no matter who that \"you\" happens to be.  The US Constitution was purposefully designed to make it very hard for any one group to get enough power to impose their will on everyone else.  Democracy requires political opposition and partisan interests to be at play.  Consensus and compromise is the *only* way to get things done in a democratic way.\n\nSo my message is this: never trust anyone who tells you that the other people's opinions don't count or that anyone who disagrees with them isn't a real member of your group.  Whether that means that those who disagree aren't \"real\" Americans or \"real\" conservatives.\n\nOr \"real\" progressives. ",

If you decimate that by consolidating and making them all government employees what then?\n\nI think the same thing when people say they want education to be centralized and moved online. Sure that would \"save\" a lot of money but it would probably also shitcan a couple of million jobs. How do those get backfilled?\n\nI'm not saying that efficiency is bad.

Republican legislators have also all signed a document that says that they will never raise taxes.

Someone like Vermin Supreme I suppose but last summer everyone was thinking that of every politician in America, the one with the LEAST chance to win a Presidential Election was the self described Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders and I think if it were possible, the DNC would have forbid him from running at the very beginning with probably little complaint from voters but now that people have had the chance to listen to him, more and more they are finding that they agree with him. \n\nThe same can be said of Trump in thr RNC. Who would have honestly thought he could win a primary six months ago especially after all of his sexist, racist and very derogatory public comments? \n\nSo it really shows that the process of using super delegates, while seeming to make sense originally, is actually just a way for political insiders to scratch each others back. To be used in the actual way that Schultz has described would be essentially the same as if they just threw away the results of every Primary during the convention and Schultz just appoints herself to be the nominee.

I also think people should not be so quick to think that Sanders would be so vulnerable to right-wing propaganda.  Look what the right threw at Obama -- radical, Muslim, not born in the US -- and how well did that work out for the GOP?  Sanders is far more experienced than Obama politically and has a legislative track record on veterans issues and gun control that many GOP voters would interpret as sympathetic.  Also, being against costly wars and excessive defense spending isn't a left-wing issue anymore.  \"Socialist\" is a label but Sanders can easily explain, as he has, that it really just means that I think the economic and political system should include and reflect the needs of the majority. The right had far more material to work with in the case of Obama.  ",

You won't be paying 3 employees $7.25 you'll be paying 2 employees $10.10. The higher you need to pay unskilled workers, the more appealing automated things like self-checkout machines, order-yourself machines, assembly line machines, etc. become. This is in addition to shipping jobs overseas. Inflation happens as a result of higher wages. The more you need to pay for the cost of production (I.e. paying more for your employees), the less goods you can produce and the less businesses can profit from.",

All of my life I've been hearing the raging hysterical crying from the economic right. Just because economist say doesn't make it so. These are the same economists who love the \"trickle down\" effect of concentrating wealth at the top. We've had 27 years of that happening and it has yet to show up in anyone's paycheck. The greedy just get more greedy and wages have stagnated or dropped since the '80s.  At the same time the economies of the world has expanded and all that wonderful productivity has gone in the pockets of the top 10%, and mostly stayed right there to be spent very slowly. \n\nThe difference is this. When the wealthy get more money they tend to sit on it, or reinvest it slowly mainly into status quo corporations like oil and big ag and pharmaceuticals. While money that goes into higher wages tends to go right back into the economy. Spent mostly on the necessities and some luxuries that the middle class currently can't afford because the middle class has become increasingly the lower class. Higher wages mean a more dynamic and fluid economy. \n\nBesides, wages need to go up just to match the inflation of the last 25 years. If people are getting paid the same now as they were in the '80s that means that they are trying to live on 80s dollars at 2016 prices. Increasingly it just doesn't work. \n\nI'm sorry but those arguments are specious.",

Employers can choose between the cheaper option nowawdays, rather than being forced to pay the minimum wage in the US.

You're talking about restaurant workers and retail people. People who are in jobs that are highly unlikely to replaced by automation or move offshore. The people who are doing those more technical or skilled jobs are already getting paid more than minimum. Yes their wages would eventually go up too, but the most immediate effect is at places like WalMart that are paying the minimum and forcing their worker to use SNAP and other programs to supplement their incomes to live. That's bullshit and I see no reason for the taxpayers to subsidize successful companies that are in the top 100 in profits. \n\nFact is that most of the jobs that could move offshore have moved offshore. Even at the current minimum wage American workers can't compete with a worker getting paid a dollar a day anyway. So that argument has flown the coop already. It isn't going to work that way.

There's still manufacturing in the United States. It's still here due to tax/tarriffs/shipping/etc. that make it more environmentally feasible to do in the US. If you start paying your means of production twice as much, it will become more economically feasible to move it elsewhere, since the money previously too much for shipping will now be worth it.",

There are far more factors then that keeping them here. I seriously doubt that raising the minimum wage would drive them all offshore. Most of those working in manufacturing are making far more than the minimum already. Again the majority of the workers affected by raising the minimum are not in manufacturing. They are in unskilled jobs. They are retail workers, 10% of the workforce. They are restaurant workers, another 10% of the workforce. They are healthcare workers, another 11%. By these numbers alone you can see why it's misleading to base whether we raise the minimum solely on the *possible* effect of it on the manufacturing sector alone.

That's how you end up with third world countries with civil war problems. People with too much time and not enough food to eat become a bit of a problem. Think it through. \n\nI suppose you could put them all in prison and put them to work for third world wages there. That's what we're doing now with a whole lot of people. That would be great!

Yet advocates of minimum wage laws seem to think that the government can raise the price of labor without reducing the amount of labor that will be hired.\n\n\nWhat about the fact that businesses need labor and are already trying to operate with as little as possible? Consider that most businesses would already fire any employees that weren't *absolutely essential*. They do this because they're naturally most interested in maximizing profits. You don't do that by paying people to stand around. \n\nWhat about the fact that no one is buying anything with no currency. When you have a class of people who cannot afford to live, you have a class of debtors. It's essentially slavery or indentured servitude. You have people living in financial bondage who are working multiple jobs and cannot make ends meet. You're arguing that giving these people a little more money wouldn't be beneficial to the economy. There is no economy for people who have no money. \n\n>[From Minimum Wage Madness, Part II:](http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2013/09/17/minimum-wage-madness-part-ii-n1701833/page/full)\n\n>> Advocates of minimum wage laws usually base their support of such laws on their estimate of how much a worker \u201cneeds\u201d in order to have \u201ca living wage\u201d \u2014 or on some other criterion that pays little or no attention to the worker\u2019s skill level, experience or general productivity. So it is hardly surprising that minimum wage laws set wages that price many a young worker out of a job.\n> \n> In South Africa, during the era of apartheid, white labor unions urged that a minimum wage law be applied to all races, to keep black workers from taking jobs away from white unionized workers by working for less than the union pay scale. Some supporters of the first federal minimum wage law in the United States \u2014 the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 \u2014 used exactly the same rationale, citing the fact that Southern construction companies, using non-union black workers, were able to come north and under-bid construction companies using unionized white labor.\n> \n\nYou're right. There's a point where we have to say that people, their time, their labor, and their families have a minimum value. When you argue against the minimum wage, you're arguing that people do not have value. You're arguing for slavery. People are not like other goods. We're sentient beings. The economy is nothing without us. \n\nThe second paragraph could be interpreted as an argument for racial discrimination and marginalization. Black people's labor should be worth as much as white people's labor. No we should not have a class of coolies based on race or anything else. This \"unskilled\" argument is tired and worthless. There's literally no employment position that does not require at least on basic skill. Fast food, which is often cited as an \"unskilled\" industry requires a number of skills and is intense labor. Not everyone is capable of maintaining a gainful fast food position. \n\n>Minimum wage laws do\n\n\n> These supporters of minimum wage laws understood long ago something that today\u2019s supporters of such laws seem not to have bothered to think through. People whose wages are raised by law do not necessarily benefit, because they are often less likely to be hired at the imposed minimum wage rate.\n\nBullshit. People are hired because they're needed regardless of the minimum wage. Employers are already working with the lowest level of labor possible. This is obvious. You're arguing that most people should earn less because a tiny portion of the population is incapable of learning any valuable skills. \n\n>While the large majority of those pushing for an increase in the minimum wage have good intentions, this has certainly not always been the case. Much like rent controls, increasing the minimum wage reduces the price of discrimination by creating a surplus of laborers for employers to choose from. Whereas many have noted the odd alliance of \u201cBootleggers and Baptists\u201d when it came to Prohibition, another odd alliance of \u201cPopulists and the Prejudiced\u201d could just as easily be applied to the minimum wage.\n\nThere's already a surplus of workers in nearly every position, let alone minimum wage positions. What we're arguing is that people who work should be adequately compensated and should be able to pay their bills. Businesses that rely on keeping people in poverty don't deserve to exist. \n\n>Indeed even the [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995) estimates that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour will cost 500,000 jobs.\n\nInitially maybe, but again that's an old argument and it doesn't stand up to scrutiny or follow history. Peoplewho have more money spend more and are better for the economy. There's only so many cheeseburgers that a wealthy person can eat. When millions receive a raise collectively they spend their money on goods and services which is good for business. \n\n>Yes, it\u2019s hard to make ends meet with a minimum wage job and such jobs certainly aren\u2019t enviable. That being said, cutting out the bottom rung from people just makes it all the harder to get by. A bad job is better than no job and it is often the first step to something better. This is further shown by an [illustrative chart](http://www.aei.org/publication/lets-review-the-adverse-effects-of-raising-the-minimum-wage-on-teenagers-when-it-increased-41-between-2007-and-2009/) provided by economist Mark Perry comparing the minimum wage with teenage unemployment. The two are almost perfectly correlated.\n\n>\n\nTeenagers shouldn't make as much as adults. I see no problem with having a separate youth minimum wage. But the median age of a fast food worker in the United States is 29. Most places will not even consider an applicant who is younger than eighteen years old. You're mischaracterizing this problem. We're talking about adults who work and are taking on debt for the sake of their employer's profits. It's a disgrace. \n",

        "comment": "All of this presupposes that businesses aren't already operating with as little labor as possible. They absolutely are. It ignores the fact that people with more money spend more and are in fact more stable and capable of caring for themselves. This actually expands the job market over time. 500,000 \"jobs\" lost represents a drop in the bucket considering the number of jobs that are created by a more financially stable working class. There are currently 15 million Americans earning less than $10 an hour. That's fifteen million receiving a modest increase in disposable income. If there are 500,000 of them who are expendable then it's a worthy sacrifice. People who earn the minimum wage are by no means a \"monopoly\". They're slaves. They would be paid less if it were legal and there are literally millions of them for an employer to choose from. That's the opposite of a monopoly. \n\nAlso, anarchocapitalism is a disease. ",

If the GOP wins the presidency, say goodbye to the last few generations of progressive reforms - Roe V Wade, net neutrality, gay marriage, legal cannabis, the ACA - they will all most likely be dismantled, at the same time introducing a wave of new handouts (and probably a new war or two) for the wealthy at the expense of the 99%.\n\nThis is really what's at stake, no matter who occupies the White House.

Lol.\n\nI'm a little older than the age group in this analysis, but let me clarify: \n\nWhen you have a campaign that raises more money from individual voters than Obama and Ron Paul (now #2 and #3 respectively) combined, one would hope that such a campaign would have a serious possibility of victory. I'll come back to this.\n\nHillary? She's simply no better than any other Republican campaign-\"donation\" whore like a Bush. I don't care what plans she has on her website that she had analysts put together for her - looking at her history, I'm calling Bullshit. \n\nOur political system has been slowly offering more and more almost false choices between the two parties on economic issues. Remember when Bill Clinton was praised for bipartisanship? Yeah, that was him selling us out to the conservative dregeulation that screwed us hard in 2008. Obama has been wonderful on social issues, but carefully similar on economic matters.\n\nA genuine, trustworthy, actually different option emerges with experience in our political system? And that candidate is informed by History, took part in Civil Rights marches and sit ins while Hillary was still a Goldwater girl...\n\nI don't see when we'll get this kind of chance again to have such a deeply progressive president. \n\nAnd with such historic, *actually unprecedented* campaign contributions, averaging under $30 a pop from actual voters...\n\nWithin my perspective, can you really blame me for contemplating if the entire political system is too rigged by corporate cash to even be saved, if Sanders doesn't win the nomination?\n\nIf our voices, our contributions, our work, doesn't matter, but party, media, and more broadly corporate influenced can convince people to hold their noses to put forward an economic Republican to the potential leadership of the democratic party? Head-to-Head Polls show Sanders as having a better chance at beating Republicans than Clinton. People trust him more. But somehow, we still have this presumption that she'll win the nomination.\n\nAt that point, I don't know how seriously I could take our government. All this talk of Hillary's inevitability is hogwash, if you remember even Obama's first presidential election. If it's not?\n\nCan you blame me for wondering if this government is so broken that it can't be fixed, no matter how \"worth it\" it really is?",

All of the, \"You must vote the party ticket\" folks are already with Hilary so all of those people will still begrudgingly vote for Bernie whereas the Independants and Republicans that are supporting Bernie will vote for Trump, write in Bernie or, probably the largest segment - not vote at all but massive numbers of them WILL NOT vote for Hillary under any circumstance. Even Democrats rank Hillary as the least trustworthy person of all (including Republicans) the candidates.

At this point you have an entire generation, maybe two, who are quickly burning out on \"elections\" that they have little say in really. Over the last thirty years the difference between candidates has been shrinking and sliding to the right to the point of pick your flavor of Republican. Clinton would have been an excellent Republican candidate thirty years ago. This election is kind of a watershed in the process. Bernie is a last shot at actually having a election that is a real choice between right and left. This is the first time we have a real chance at slowing the momentum to the right and actually bringing it back at least toward the center. If Bernie isn't the candidate then the Democrats have declared themselves to be just a slightly less onerous brand of Republican. No telling what happens next after that.

I have dozens of reasons for thinking she is the worst possible candidate but without ANY of that, I can say that EVERYONE should be able to see that she is a liability because of her pending congressional issues. EVEN IF IT AMOUNTS TO NOTHING IT'S STILL SOMETHING THE GOP CAN DRAG OUT FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS. All of this, \"Winning the White House is the most important thing\" that I keep hearing from the Clinton crowd goes both ways and since it's more likely that Bernie would win the general election and there's even a possibilty that Hillary would need to drop out, even considering her is the dumbest thing the DNC has ever done. The fact that the Vice Chair of the DNC has resigned over this should really be an eye opener for Hillary fans but she can clearly do no wrong in the eyes of her faithful robots. \n\nHere. https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/992255820829422/?type=3&theater\nLatest Quinnepac poll showing that Bernie destroys all GOP opponents.

I'm here to vote for Bernie and that's it. I was wrong earlier though when I said Hillary has more money.

I was saying that because you said voting for Trump is throwing away your country.  So if you think Trump is worse than Hillary and they are the two major party nominees then you need to vote for the less worse one, or you had a hand in helping the worse one get elected.\n\nIf you honestly believe Trump is better than Hillary then by all means vote for him in the GE. But writing in a candidate who isn't running is basically throwing a tantrum and knocking over the Monopoly board. It does no good. It actively does harm.\n\nI personally believe Trump will be way worse than W. The idea of that impulsive, megalomaniac, insecure fuckwit with the nuclear codes honestly makes my balls shrivel with fear. It causes me physical paint.\n\nAnd also if you think honestly that Hillary is going to invade Iran or East Timor, then I feel bad for you and the paranoia you must suffer from. The Iran deal the President made had been brewing since before Biden took over as Sec State. She has no reason to blow that up. Too much of her legacy is tied up in Obamas. As for East Timor... what honestly makes you think thats a possibility? I am actually sitting here trying to figure out if that is a genuine concern of yours or if you are being intentionally flippant. \n\nNorth Korea, on the other hand... well with the human rights violations and constant threats of attacks against the west and its neighbors and the fact that they are at the very least working on a nuclear weapon, if not have already detonated one, leads me to believe that there may be actual cause to invade. But Sec. Clinton isn't stupid enough to risk war with China so she would only authorize that with China's blessing. My understanding is China is getting sick of Un's shit so... I guess we will wait and see on that one.",

        "comment": "From /u/BlueGold and has been copied under multiple posts:\n\n>This is not a partisan statement, it's a factual one: The title of this post is incredibly misleading\nBased on the Court's Decision & Order issued by the Appellate Division (2d) of New York, issued on Feb. 24, 2016 - Bill O'Reilly did not \"lose custody of kids after assaulting his wife\" as the title of this post suggests.\nNow, making this comment was a hard decision because, well... O'Reilly is a cunt - a hypocritical cunt, at that. But he did not lose custody of his kids, let alone \"after\" (semantically suggestive of 'because' or 'due to' [assault charge], etc) beating his wife.\nSo this was a decision affirming an NY County Supreme Court (their court system is kinda backwards, for anyone confused by the sequential affirmation order) ruling in 2014 regarding the decision making authority and residential arrangements.\nThis order I linked above states expressly that O'Reilly and his ex-wife, Maureen McPhilmy, are to maintain 'Joint Legal Custody' and 'Joint Decision-Making Authority.'\nFrom the Court Order:\nWhile ordinarily it is not appropriate to award joint legal custody and decision-making authority where the parties are antagonistic toward one another (see Irizarry v Irizarry, 115 AD3d 913), in this case, the record supports the court's finding that, despite their antagonism, the parties have been able to agree on most decisions concerning the children (see Matter of Thorpe v Homoet, 116 AD3d 962, 963). Moreover, the record supports the court's finding that if either parent were awarded sole decision-making authority, there would be a danger that it would be used to exclude the other parent from meaningful participation [] in the children's lives.\nWhat happened was that O'Reilly wanted full custody and full decision-making authority, and this Court last Wednesday said \"Uh no, Bill - you both get equal custody and decision-making authority.\" As you can see, the Court actually finds that they're usually quite able to make decisions together in their children's best interests.\nThis Court did, however, give Maureen McPhilmy primary 'Residential Custody,' which is very different than both 'legal custody' and 'decision-making authority' by legal definition, as outlined in NY state statute. If you read the language in the very brief order, they weigh this decision with the preference of O'Reilly's two children, 13 & 17, who both prefer to live with their mother.\nBut as far as legal custody, and decision-making authority, Bill and his ex-wife still have complete joint, equal authority.\nIt's definitely fair, in a DR legal sense, to consider this ruling a loss for O'Reilly, and one he probably damn well deserves. But the Court does not entertain allegations of domestic abuse in this case, but rather just the preference of his children which presumably was made quite clear during discovery/evidentiary pre-trial procedures before the County SC ruling, and/or this Appellate ruling.\nSo, did Bill O'Reilly loose ['lose'] a court case regarding his children that results in his having less residential time allotment with them? Ultimately, yes he did.\nDid Bill O'Reilly loose ['lose' - good lookin' out grammar bros] custody of his children after beating his wife? Not by any legal metric.\nAgain, I am not a supporter of Bill O'Reilly. However, I really don't like when this place produces reactionary 'upvote because title' tendencies. It comes off as really awkward and pretty fuckin lame. We in /r/atheism should always endeavor for expeditious fact-finding and bullshit-sifting, as our subject matter ultimately requires.\n\nEdit: Sorry for the formatting.

Although, I typically did it with the thought in mind of securing a political party for them in Maine which the Green party did in 2000 when Nader got more than 5% of the overall vote. \n\nIf Bernie doesn't win. I don't know. I'm very unlikely to vote for Hillary but I'm not thrilled with Trump either. Those will be the only options in Maine this year. I could write in Bernie and I just may do that. Voting for Hillary is not the \"lesser of two evils\" here and Trump is like electing Paul LePage to the presidency. I'm tired of heads of state calling everyone stupid and openly using racist language. For now, I'm for Bernie. If he isn't nominated, I'll worry about that once I see the options. I don't think I vote for Hillary even if she was the only name on the ballot though.",

The author did find a quote where she used the term \"zionist jews\" but again, that does not refer to all jews, collectively, coming together to plot 9/11. It was mostly a reference to Mossad.\n\nOver all, I disagree with this woman's theory, but considering the Mossad connections to the 9/11 hijackers, I can understand how she developed it. It is not a slight against jews or based in prejudice against the entire religion, as far as I can tell. That's just the way the pro-Israeli NY Post decided to frame it.

But, that's not feasible. I have a wife and 3 children that need food. We have a house that needs payed for, we have cars that needs fuel and insurance, we have utility bills, we have all our combined living expenses taking a huge chunk out of my income. At the end of the year, I may have managed to put away $10-15k if I try real hard.

Hillary's failure as Secretary of State was in not diffusing the situation or at the very least making it very clear that the US would not be supporting anyone in Libya which hopefully would have kept England and France from fully committing. We didn't just back them up though, we were all gung ho for it. I won't put the blame on her shoulders alone though - Obama was her boss and shit rises to the top. They can shift blame for Iraq, Afghanistan and ISIS around all they want but the US involvement in Libya is there baggage. \n\nI agree though, this all simply goes back to the fact that it doesn't really matter who the politicians are, the Military Industrial Complex is in control.

But I would say that most Libertarians are of the belief that you should have a very small amount of government and that most problems can be worked out at the local level.  As far as taxes go, it's not that Libertarians think just they should be immune from them, but that no one should be paying taxes at the end of a gun.  If government was small enough, there might be innovative ways to fund it.  For instance, maybe if you take the military surplus of equipment and sell it off to other countries, then bank that money and use the interest to pay for the government.  This assumes the interest rate was a more normal 3 to 5% and government overhead was next to nothing.",

Certainly not in the last 50 years or so, in which political events are generated to bring violence at the edges into the center. So that violence at these events, which may start organically, is in effect spot lit and encouraged to the point where it becomes something that is legitimately out of control of anyone. And then the spectacle of political violence is itself seen as something that is a problem that needs to be solved by this strongman character who incited the initial event in the first place.\n\n",

Sanders plan includes essentially the complete elimination of health care insurance, making health insurance a right. The amount of reduction the average person pays each year in Insurance premiums is far greater than what the average tax increase would be. Don't bother to dispute it. You're not going to convince me and I'm not going to convince you. There are a thousand things on the Internet that we can link to each other and it's really an argument between conservative and liberal economists. I just happen to agree with the liberal economists and you agree with the conservative ones. I just wanted to present the point that Sanders is proposing INCREASING the take home pay for the average American and ESPECIALLY those in the lower tax brackets. ",

The fact is that Sanders believes that his tax plan (and the rest of the world that has universal health care tends to agree with him) will result in the average american actually saving money. The entire economy would save something like 1.5 trillion a year that is simply and entirely wasted on the Insurance industry for billing, coding, collections, and on and on. \n\nedit: the 1.5 trillion is probably an exaggeration the more I think about it and I'm not going to take the time to go look it up.

Some places, completely different in service or product, but have a similar experience and maybe one with a better outcome of newly learned reward than the other. \r\rSo in my end statement lol. I would not have made something like this because one, no one is perfect and two, this is applying that you can judge a book by its cover, which you never can. Sometimes...but not 90% if at least.

Although, I think some will but probably not enough for Sanders to take the edge like Obama did. I think he'll need to win outright before the convention. If he wins NY, he'll be doing pretty well.

But he knows next to nothing about government or the US constitution, and has a narrow range of attention, so I feel he would become the puppet of his advisors in many areas, which would be the most dangerous thing about him.\n\nCruz seems completely evil to me. He claims to be a strict constitutionalist, but I feel his interpretation of the constitution is at odds with interpretations of most good people. I would expect that he would wreck havoc in the name of the constitution.\n\nI guess in my view Trump is a zombie, and Cruz is a vampire.\n\nMy daughter and another young woman her age see it the opposite. They see Trump as the greater danger, because he would be like a bull in a china shop, would do things outside of the limits of presidential power, and his supporters would back him at every step. They see Cruz as being more of a mainstream government fellow who is able to be reasonable.",

They've thrown just about everything but the kitchen sink at her and her husband in the hopes that it will ruin their reputation with the public, and to some degree that's succeeded. But the Clintons have also survived those attacks and thrived, to the degree that Hillary went on to become a Senator from New York before accepting a cabinet position as Secretary of State. She's better known than Bernie, and with the exception of her military/foreign policy platforms [is pretty damned close to him on her positions.](http://presidential-candidates.insidegov.com/compare/35-40/Bernie-Sanders-vs-Hillary-Clinton)\n\nBernie, by way of comparison, doesn't have the same name recognition (he's had to fight for it in his campaign) and he's a self-described Democratic Socialist which means the right wing are happily smearing him as a communist. He wants to undo Obama's hard-won health reform law and replace it with something better, while the Democratic establishment is shrieking that it's too soon and not feasible right now.\n\nBernie is my preferred candidate, but at the moment it doesn't look like he'll be able to overcome the advantages that Hillary started with. I would like to be wrong with that but I never assumed that I would be. For now I'm just happy that he's in the race making a lot of noise and educating people about what Democratic Socialism has to offer. If he can also influence the Democratic Party so they stop trying to court the center-right and instead embrace the left wing, I would be happy.\n\nI don't reject Hillary Clinton as the nominee, I'd just like it better if it were Bernie.",

        "comment": "Well, here's a few.\n\n(Disclosure, I kind of like Bernie--and voted for him, but more against Hillary than for him.  In my heart, I want to like him more than I do, because my head tells me he has some ideas that will prove at best impossible and at worst disastrous.)\n\nLet's start by talking the area I'm most concerned about, foreign policy.  Bernie is an isolationist who advocates what I'll politely term a retreat from the American position on the world stage.  I'm no neoconservative, have three deployments to Iraq under my belt, and am a National Guardsman, so I full well understand the dangers and problems inherent in an adventurous, interventionist foreign policy like the one we pursued under President Bush, but I believe his isolationism (like Trump and Rand Paul's) is a dangerous abrogation of our position as the closest thing to a world hegemon.\n\nRetreating from the world stage will not be without foreign consequences--nature abhors a vaccuum, and our place will be taken--or worse, _fought over_--by other regional and near peer powers like Iran, China, Russia, et al.\n\nThis will lead to greater instability worldwide and would probably destroy whatever credibilty we have with our allies, because basically we have obligated ourselves to be the leaders of the free world and ensure its protection.  When we abrogate that responsibility--particularly in the span of one or two presidential terms--we will send our weaker allies looking for someone they can trust.  The greatest beneficiaries of American isolationism will not be our soldiers, nor our domestic programs, but dictators like Putin.\n\nSo there's one thing that I think I can well articulate that I don't agree with or like that Bernie says.\n\nSecondly, lets move towards his \"free college\" deal.  First off, it doesn't actually fix what is systemically wrong, which is that college is simultaneously overvalued and overpriced.\n\nWhat are the consequences of an \"everybody goes to college\" approach?  I'll tell you, it isn't that everybody gets a good paying job with no college debt--it's that _every job will require a college degree_.  You'll need a college degree to work at Starbucks, a bachelorate in real estate to sell houses, etc.  \n\nCollege graduates making more money is based on scarcity, not some magical function of their education--it is already to the point to where people younger than me (I'm 34) would need a masters to get hired on for jobs I needed just a BS for.  \"Giving\" college to everyone would only make this worse.  There already aren't enough jobs for the college graduates we already have, and having more people go to college won't make more jobs for them magically appear.\n\nIn fact, it may put downward wage preassures on people who are already employed, which can hardly be the outcome Bernie's got in mind.  \n\n(I'm not even going to go into one of my pet peeves which is that not only should everybody _not_ go to college [for a variety of reasons], everybody who wants to go shouldn't automatically get in, and everybody who goes ought not to pass.  Degrees should be indicative of an education, not a four year passage of time.  Colleges should be more rigorous in their educational standards than they already are, and making college the new high school will only exacerabate that problem).  \n\nFurthermore, it has second and third order effects that people outside the armed forces don't quite seem to grasp--one of the best and primary motivators for recruitment is the GI Bill.  That's right, if you want \"free\" college, _there's already a way to get it_.  You go serve your country for a few years, either before school as an enlisted member, or afterwards if you go the ROTC/Service Academy route.  This is an invaluable recruiting tool that helps keep our already stressed all-volunteer force staffed.  Without it, and in the face of what will almost certainly be declining recruitment, the only option is not a palatable one--mandatory service, ie. the draft.\n\nIt's a tough pill to swallow, I get, but that's why I also cannot see eye to eye with Bernie on his appraoch to college (to say nothing of how we'd fund it).  \n\nAll that said, in a general election, I would very likely still vote for him, if only because I think Congress and the general machinery of power and institutional inertia in DC would keep him from going too far off the rails.\n\nHope that's an example of what you're looking for.",

I belive that it should be free, every one should have the right to go to College, even if they dont have the necessary wealth. With more education the country will thrive more, having many more educated people, this in it self will create more jobs, of course not in bulk, so it might not help the unemployment rate... but it will allow for many more qualified workers to start working in the country. The if you have a degree statement will therefore not be used any more, but the employers will seek a much more qualified person. with this many other things will grow as well. By the way, free education will not mean that every person graduates.. it will be a much tougher system, where the people that will get a degree will have to really know the feild, instead of paying the school for a degree. and with all this the rate of graduates wil not increase dramatically, as seen in Germany, Switzerland... these are places where free education is seen... Education should be sen as a human right at this point, education is one of the most important things... \n\nNext the forigh policy. Sadly i just dont se why the US has to be all around the world, fighting fights.. war should not be the rightful action. Of course there can be exceptions, ISIS for me would be considered an exception, but other then that, why is the US constantly fighting  in the middle east, why does America see it self as the world peace bringer... i just do see how that helps any one..\n\nFunding, The amount of money spent on the military, if cut would almost cover the whole free education system, it is a thing that can be done... \n\nI hope you do vote for him, i really cannot seer any other nominee better then sanders at this time. Trump and Cruz are just awfull... Hillary sadly not that much difference.\n\nBy the way, im not from the US so i don't have any gain in Bernie Sanders winning, other then me liking his ideology..\n",

Those who wanted it desperately to pass neglect to report the full truth of what is happening. Not saying that is the case here, but it's often what has happened.

You think if meth or crack becomes legal people will suddenly go \"Now that its legal I'm gonna go do this fucked up drug that could kill me or wreck my life!\" Of course not! I smoke weed but even if crack or meth or heroin was legalized id never touch that shit and neither would 99% of people. The reason legalization is a big deal is because the government wastes billions arresting and incarcerating people for the heinous crime of putting drugs in their own body. Wouldn't it be better to collect revenue from people buying drugs instead?",

What is even more deplorable is that 47 Senate Republicans voted not help lead poisoned children.\n\nHad you bothered to look, instead of assuming, you would have seen that this was a vote on that **one thing**. The Republicans, as per usual, decided to punish children for something a Republican state administration caused. \n\nA comment towards the end of the article sums up what I feel about their fuckery...\n\n> Democrats should keep the actions of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the 46 Republicans who voted for this amendment in mind the next time one of these Republicans demands federal aid after a flood, fire, or hurricane.",

Even PBS advertises for oil industry and even arms manufacturers. The article's measurement of MSNBC's climate change coverage to oil industry advertising ratio did not follow the same criteria. They say they catalogued the advertising for the two same weeks as they did for CNN, but they didn't do the same measurement of the CC reporting, citing only anecdotally a single Hardball segment.  \n\nAlso, it seems like a strange premise from the outset to compare advertising with news content. Climate change *news* (per se) is probably and likely less frequent or regular than advertising purchased by one of the biggest industries that is constantly throwing ad money at any media venue they can, year round, regardless of whether there is any Climate change news being reported.

        "comment": "[PUMAs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_United_Means_Action)\n\nPeople United Means Action\" (or PUMA) was a political action committee in the United States that opposed the Democratic Party leadership and the nomination of Senator Barack Obama as the Democratic candidate for President in the 2008 presidential election. PUMA began as an effort by supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton who believed that Clinton should have been the Democratic nominee. According to PUMA, \"We [were] protesting the 2008 Presidential election because we refuse to support a nominee who was selected by the leadership rather than elected by the voters.\"\n\nSee?\n\nAnd how's this for \"rigging\":  In the 2008 Democratic Primary, both Florida and Michigan results were thrown out by Democratic party leadership because they said that those states held their conventions too early.  Hillary Clinton won both of those states by large margins.  She won 100% of the delegates in Michigan because Obama screwed up and didn't even get on the ballot.  How would you feel if Bernie lost 120 *actual* delegates (not Superdelegates) because the Democratic national committee invalidated the results of two of the most populous states in early voting.  Would that complaint be enough for you to claim that the primary \"appeared heavily rigged for a candidate\"?  If so, then I've proven my point.\n\nYou must really be a young'un if you don't remember PUMAs. They were everywhere, on every news program, bitching about the rigged primaries, and how Hillary got railroaded out of her rightful nomination by the Democratic establishment who were playing the race card.  \n\nYou don't remember where the birth certificate controversy came from?  It came from PUMAs.  Jeremiah Wright controversy?  PUMAs.  Secret Muslim?  PUMAs.  Republicans didn't come up with any of those at all.  PUMAs were Hillary Clinton's \"attack dog\" PAC that developed it's own cultish following during the 2008 primary.  Obama's supporters called PUMA \"Party Unity, My Ass.\"\n\nBut if you think that your claims of rigging this time are legitimate while the people who complained in the primaries before you are false... well, take your place in history.  Nobody believes you any more than they believed those people, and 8 years from now, some kid will ask you, \"What's a Bernie Bro?\"",

So, I have to wonder if maybe it is best to vote for Stein or not vote at all.  Because voting in my state doesn't matter, the argument of what vote is most effective at helping my cause goes out the window. I guess I'm left with the question of whether I'd like to cast a meaningless, symbolic vote, the biggest \"fuck you\" I can send to the Democratic party (a vote for Trump by a registered Democrat), or just not bother with any of it since it won't accomplish anything.",

(and maybe the invertebrate Obama should have appointed a progressive justice instead of another milquetoast moderate). In case you weren't aware, Presidents are elected to 4-year terms, not 8-year terms.\n\nIf Trump wins 2016, the Dems will have a chance to back an actual progressive in 2016 and wipe the floor with him in 2020. If Hillary wins it will be another 16-20 years before we get a chance to put a progressive in the White House. It will be 20+ years before the Dems do a goddamn thing to actually address economic inequality (at which point it will be far too late).\n\nSo spare me your condescension and push your \"lesser evil\" fearmongering bullshit on someone dumb enough to buy into it. There are bigger problems that need to be dealt with than avoiding a 4-year (likely feckless) Trump presidency.",

So Trump will get to appoint RGB's replacement making the court 5-4 (conservative) which is what we had until very recently anyway.\n\nAs I've said, it is wild conjecture on your part that 3 justices will retire within the next four years.  If they do that with Trump in the White House, then I wish them the best of luck sleeping at night.  It's far more likely that Trump will make at most 1 Supreme Court appointment.\n\nOh, right, but I forgot about your famed 1=3 theorem.  I get it if you don't want to post your proof on reddit.

His pick meant to show the intransigence of the GOP. He is everything they say the want in a Justice,knowing they would not confirm him or any nominee put forth from Obama.\n\nThe next president is not bound by the Obama nomination, and Obama is not bound to keep him after the election.  \n\n>So what we actually have is a soon-to-be 5-4 (left leaning) court\n\nNo Garland will never be appointed unless Obama keeps him after a Democrat gets elected in the lame duck, and he is not left leaning. \n\nIf Trump gets elected it would be 5/4 conservative unless the Dems could block his nominee keeping it 4/4. Them with the next appointment... almost sure to happen in the next 4 years...Kennedy is 79, Breyer is 77 and RBG is just old an frail. Makes it 6/3 conservative. The end of Rowe v Wade, Voting right, Civil rights ...just starry.\n\nAnd for this reason alone I will campaign  for the Democratic nominee...even a 3 way old woman.

But that would be more your mistake than theirs.\n\nHowever, even their most conservative hosts are no where near pushing a far right agenda.  I'm really not sure what you mean by that.\n\nAnd if you're talking about any other channel, there is no remote pretense of being left wing at all.

Bernie is sensational in my mind, but when one sensational in any way that can be easily spun to disillusion and against the flow of the processes and precedents in place then you have a candidate that both party systems don't want and a narrative that is dismissed by the largest source of news information, tv.

I suspect that the conclusions you have drawn are mostly from what has been stated from the media. I don't mean this in a condescending way as I'm sure a large percentage of Americans have not seen the speeches or debates either. \n\nYou see, their proposed policies do have seemingly minuscule differences that would have a large impact in the end (I'm sorry for the lack of an example). The conclusion that their policies are the same seems easily drawn from the minute amount of detail and sourcing that medians provide. \nHowever, here's the deal with the republican supporting gay rights. Donald Trump was initially a democrat and [OPINION/PERSONAL SPECULATION FROM HERE ON] I personally believe that he only ran as a republican because he could more easily defeat the republicans than the democrats with his non-detailed \"policies\" and extravagant proposals early on in the race. Donald trump is quite the opportunist. This would explain why his beliefs align quite well with those of the other Democratic candidates. \n\nIn terms of \"Americans going with whatever is on Tv at the time,\" this is very much a problem here. Although this isn't the case with everyone, the media controls a lot of people's opinions. It has demonized trump (and Clinton) quite well in my area. Here's the plot twist. I'm a fifteen year old. This means that I know what my generation in my area (Near San Francisco, CA) is thinking. Nearly everyone I have spoken to on the matter of the election believe that Trump is a racist bigot and Clinton is a manipulative liar. They even go so far as to say that they'll leave the country if trump wins presidency. Now, domestic ignorance is clearly a huge issue of my generation. People seem to just go with whatever they are told by the media and their conservative parents can't even tell them what to think. The media's grip on the young American's mind is far too strong. \n\nI tried to keep little bias and opinion in my comment, but it's very difficult to prove a point without inserting a little of my own belief. Even so, my opinions should be taken with a grain of salt because of my age and my statements may be proven false. I'm sorry if I have made any statements that have been proven wrong or invalid. ",

        "comment": "I will post my opinion on the matter before doing research on the matter and edit my post later telling you how my opinion has changed. However, before I talk about your question, I'd like to present some background information on myself. This way, you know exactly what KIND of American you're heading the opinions of. \n\nI am an Asian-American whose father was born in the Philippines and illegally immigrated to California. My father felt obligated to serve the country that upgraded his life from the poor farming life that he had lived in the Philippines so he served in the military for a number of years. My mother's family has a more complicated history of communism taking their wealth and illegal immigration, but the gist is that she was born in the United States and grew up in a poor Chinese-dense community. \nI was raised in a moderately sized city full of white-religious liberals (I don't mean this I'm a derogatory way. Simply stating their demographic). Growing up I was always told things like \"you can be whatever you want to be when you grow up\" and \"treat others the way you want to be treated\". These beliefs stuck with me until I grew interested in world history and politics (a subject everyone at my school hates). Everything from Communism to Islam. This is when I began to adopt my beliefs:\n-Teach my peers about politics from a neutral position by only presenting facts\n-I felt that my peers don't understand the potential consequences of too much socialism. They have been fooled by the optimism of youth and have no knowledge of communism's history. \n-Moderatism is the way to go. Not too socialist but not too capitalist. (I lean right wing still)\nAs you can see, I grew to be a moderate right-wing due to my research on the history of socialism and communism (mainly China and USSR) but I still want to present information as neutrally as possible because I think that people deserve to believe anything they want as long as they made an educated decision to believe it. My parents have always been more right wing and conservative, but I have denied a fair amount of the things they believe. \nI gave you a lot of information about me so that you understand that other people with different (or maybe similar) upbringings will have different opinions and that although I try to exclude it, opinion dominates a large part of what I say. Anyways, I hope this comment helps you.\n\n\nAlthough I believe that Trump dropping out to help Hillary is a possibility, I don't believe that this will be the case. My reasoning is this: Trump is a very well established businessman and one of the necessary traits of being successful in the way that he is, is to be opportunistic. His field of work requires choosing your friends wisely and springing on any opportunity that will benefit you in the end. Trump would gain much more personal wealth and create better relationships with potential business partners by becoming the president than if he were to reveal that his entire campaign was a scam to manipulate the people. I'm sure people would be greatly upset to be cheated in that way. \nSecondly, although this is only inferred, he is very nationalistic. He seems to have respect for the country and economy that built who he is today. Growing up in such a capitalist nation can be tough, but he had the ability (and luck) to thrive and so he feels a bit grateful. You can sense the nationalism in the... Moderate bigotism that he expresses and his motto \"Let's make America great again!\" (Not exact wording). \nLastly, if Hillary were to become president, he would lose money. Hillary is quite left wing and would likely impose/maintain higher taxes for the rich (even though she's pro free-trade. It's a little bit weird that she wants to promote the market while also hindering it). At the moment, citizens are being taxed based on income, and I'm sure someone who profits as much as trump doesn't want these taxes in place. Overall, her left wingness would not be appealing to Trump (who grew wealthy by right wing fundamentals). \n\nEDIT: Ok, so the two main arguments that I've picked up on from that video are that Trump has claimed to be friends with Hillary on many occasions and that Trump's policies align with Hillary's. The problem is, these interviews are outdated. The videos are from the long period that he sided Democrat and of course, anyone who claims to be democrat should have Democrat ideals and have Democratic friends. Now he claims to side Republican and has switched most (not all) of his proposed policies to appeal to Republicans. HOWEVER, we cannot know for sure what Trump truly is. The possibilities are that Trump lied about being a democrat, Trump lied about being a republican, Trump really has changed his mind, or Trump lied about both and just goes with whatever will be the most advantageous to him. Personally, I believe the third one, but I cannot back this up with solid evidence. It is up to you to take my opinions with no weight or completely support them. If you want to ask any more questions at all (don't need to be GOP race related) you can ask them. I'm very hard to offend so don't worry about that... \nAnyways, I'd like to ask why you're keeping up with the GOP race in America. I can think of various reasons that you might, but I want to know why YOU do it. It may be a reason that I've never thought about. ",

I was raised agnostic/atheist, but am now basically Christian.\nWhen I was younger, I was one of 4 non-white children at my school. This was a time when gay was a common insult in schools, and when I was singled out for my race.\nAs I've grown up, I've seen my country change so much around me. The high schools I went to were majority non-white. Most people I know are gay now. Being poor was a problem when I was little, now you get everything handed to you here. My primary school taught Christianity, my high schools teach Islam. Emo culture wasn't here. Drugs culture was much less significant. TV was cleverer. Music wasn't as overtly sexual. Etc etc.\n\nI've seen England change. But here's the problem, anyone who says that here will be called a racist, or homophobic or just \"offensive\". I believe in tradition and wholesomeness. I also believe each people deserves the right to maintain majority population in it's own land. I believe Kenya should be majority Kenyan. Poland Polish. Britain British.\n\nSo, the people who normally yell racist at that idea are stumped by me, because they're raised to believe only white people are racist. That leaves me an outsider and in a good position to see the world as it is, then form my opinions after.\n\nThe reason I'm interested in America is that Britain just does as it's told.\n\nEven now, in the EU referendum. Britain loses money by being in. We get around 3 million immigrants a year (I can't remember the number, but it has a 3 and its large) etc. So it's in our best interests to leave.\nObama came over, and told us that if we leave, we'll no longer be on good terms with the US economically or politically. People listen to his threats. In Britain, the kids are being raised to like him, not to have their own opinion, to like him.\n\nThe reason I'm interested in America now, is that to the outsider's eye, it is rigged. Since I'm not in America, I can see the lies and slip ups that the media there keeps hidden. Since I'm good with a computer, I can do the same for the UK in most cases.\n\nThe way it looks from over here, is two friends running for president. It therefore wouldn't matter who won, as the policies would be the same. Obama had different views to Romney supposedly. I remember him saying he'd pull troops out of the middle east, instead he sent more in. Its just lies like that, so obviously used to win votes that make it clear the choice doesn't exist- they just do as they please.\n\nIf you believe this idea that there is a \"conspiracy\" among the global elite, then its especially worrying. And all that would mean is they were friends who worked towards a common goal.\n\nI don't know how messaging works here, but if you do, we can work out someplace else to talk besides comments here. I'm interested in what you have to say.",

And then someone is dead or maimed, and it costs us, the American taxpayer, over [$200 *billion* a year](http://www.businessinsider.com/gun-violence-costs-america-more-than-229-billion-every-year-2015-4). So excuse us if we want you to prove you're responsible *before* we let you have a deadly weapon. And before you list your military record again, I know plenty of vets who look just fine on the surface until the PTSD kicks in and turns them into a blubbering puddle of goo that is just as likely to shoot himself as his family and friends, so don't assume that military service ([or even being a marksman](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-kentucky-man-damien-lacambra-charged-in-wifes-shooting-death/)) qualifies one for civilian gun ownership. NJ is the most densely populated state in the union; introducing guns to a bunch of already crowded and mostly pissed of and self centered people is a horrible idea. If you don't like NJ's gun laws, I suggest you live somewhere else. I hear Afghanistan is lovely this time of year.

They're wrong on both counts as America was never exactly the way they wish to remember it and isn't exactly becoming what they feel like constantly railing against. \n\nThe philosophy that Americans, in my personal opinion as an American, lose sight of is that the most perfect thing about America is that America cannot be perfect. It simply can't be the \"perfect America\" for every American. The absolute best that we can aspire to is to be accepting of the fact that there will be things that we love and things that we hate and most everything else will fall somewhere in the middle. \n\nThe problem that makes it feel like the right wing hates America is because many of their platform issues revolve around taking away freedoms from other people. A right winger will respond to that by saying that a left winger is doing the same with gun control but even if liberals were arguing for the complete ban of all firearms, comparing the freedom to own an inanimate object to the freedom to marry your life long partner aren't the same things. For the record, I believe in the freedom of both but I can tell that one is a very personal, human thing while the other is not. The only way the right wing gets what they want out of their version of America is by altering very dramatically the human experience of *other* Americans - not their own and they don't see how that is just a very hateful and evil thing from the perspective of their opponents.

No other industry enjoys such explicit legal protections, probably because if the manufacturers of firearms had to pay lawyers to get every lawsuit from one of their victims dismissed, they wouldn't make any profits. That's not a bad thing. Instead, they threaten and cajole politicians into passing laws that protect them by preventing the lawsuits from ever being filed and making sure that everyone has easy access to their products, ensuring their profits stay black even if the streets run red. They spread propaganda to keep people like you ignorant and afraid and buying more guns, endangering your family and everyone around you. \n\nYou may think you're a Responsible Gun Owner\u2122, but so does every redneck hick moron who lets his five year old daughter play with his gun. Go over to /r/GunsAreCool and see how many posts there are *every day* where some allegedly Responsible Gun Owner\u2122 shoots himself or his family or lets his gun get into the hands of a child or escalates a situation from verbal arguing to deadly force just because he can. Dozens of posts, every day. On average, 88 people are shot by a gun in the US *every day*. I don't care how many guns don't get fired every day, if you don't find that unacceptable, you're part of the problem. \n\nAs I said once already, most gun owners may be responsible and law abiding, until they're not. Then someone is dead. Or worse, they're only wounded and wasting money and resources that could be going to people with actual medical emergencies. Facts are facts, you cannot change them or dismiss ones you don't agree with (I mean, you can, but then you're just proving that you're another paranoid delusional guntroll), and the facts here clearly show that states and countries with fewer guns see far less gun violence. Go ahead and google it, I'm not going to do the work for you. \n\nThe rest of your little rant is just total bullshit, especially that \"free society\" canard. There are plenty of free societies that do not allow widespread gun ownership. Not only are they happy, but they don't spend billions of dollars a year on healing, rehabilitating, and replacing victims of gun violence. So take your gun lobby approved talking points and go pound sand. ",

Especially if Ford or Budweiser sold their product as something that was designed to protect people. You cannot even file a lawsuit against Colt or Smith & Wesson because Federal law expressly forbids that. It is literally the only industry that enjoys such protections under the law, because without that they would be responding to tens of thousands of lawsuits a year, costing them billions and making them so unprofitable they would have to shut down. What part of this are you not understanding? Do I have to draw it out in crayon for you? \n\nAnd again with your bullshit idea of a \"free society\" that even a freshman high school debater wouldn't use. We don't allow people to yell \"fire\" in a crowded theatre. We don't allow children to drive cars or drink alcohol. We don't allow people to own nuclear or biological weapons. We don't allow people to use narcotics without the supervision of a doctor. We don't allow the unauthorized copying of movies, tv shows, or music. There's a lot of things America doesn't allow, guess we're not a free society by your definition. Not sure if you know that.\n\n>The choice is not between order and liberty. It is between liberty with order and anarchy without either.

        "comment": "As a South Jersey resident, I am very familiar with Trump and his A.C. antics.  Wouldn't vote for him.  That being said, Chomsky is overstating the danger.  Most of Trumps wacky policies are domestic and all of them need Congressional approval and/or money.  He'll never get it.  They're completely hostile toward him.  And Trump doesn't forgive.  He'll go after anyone that spoke out against him in the GOP.  You'll probably have a perpetual hung Congress with Trump.\n\nHillary is anxious to prove that a woman is just as aggressive as a man in the job of president.  The NATO bombing is a preview of her foreign policy.  She's under the misguided impression interventionism works if you just commit enough money, time, resources and smarts.  She's wrong and arrogant to think so.  Expect the bombs to fall on Iran if she's elected.  That will jam up the Straight of Hormuz long enough to drive oil prices through the roof, which will destroy U.S. commerce.\n\nTrump's volatility may put us exactly in the same position.  Depending on what day it is.\n\nIf you want a sane candidate that's on the ballots of all 50 states, Gary Johnson is the likely Libertarian candidate.  As a Democrat, you probably don't agree with him on every issue, but he's pretty flexible.  He's not a hardcore Libertarian.  He was a Republican governor in NM, normally a Democratic state.  He left with a surplus in the budget.  His VP pick is Weld, former Republican Mass governor.  Again, you won't agree on it all, but they both seem pretty reasonable guys and they both definitely want to bring the troops home.  Depends on your priorities, I guess.\n\nJill Stein is also running if you like Bernie Sanders, she's Bernie Sanders x 10.  She's running for the Green Party.  I don't agree with socialist economic policies because I don't think they can work, but if you do, you can at least vote your conscience.  \n\nHillary is going to get the nom.  She and Trump are both pretty monstrous.  Hillary is a proven monster.  Trump is merely a likely one.",

Bernie supporters assume everyone who supports a different candidate is corrupt, a pawn of others who are corrupt, or just misinformed by the biased media and the \"establishment\". They reach these conclusions almost entirely based on emotion, rather than rationality or evidence. You couldn't possibly look at the data and reach any conclusion but that Sanders is perfect. \n\nThey site things like a \"rigged system\" but their evidence never quite proves what they think it proves. They start with an assumption: that everybody and everything is biased against them and invalid. They find evidence to bolster that narrative everywhere. EVERYWHERE.\n\nIf you point out vote totals, lack of negative media coverage, the 2008 election, anything that undercuts their narrative, it's dismissed immediately.\n\nNot to mention that they constantly attack Hillary's character and integrity without any real evidence. For example, they site her private email server as evidence of her duplicity, but it is reasonable to assume that she used a private server to protect herself from the inevitable GOP investigations, not to hide corrupt dealings. \n\nHer supporters then defend her using the words you mentioned and impune her detractors for attacking her unfairly. \n\nTo me, Hillary is the moderate candidate and her supporters are more centrist and reasonable then either of her current opponents.",

I think Trump is trying to boost Bernie enough to get the delegates needed to tie Hillary. This would cause a very bitter battle between Hillary and Bernie and their supporters. As trump already has the Republican nomination sewed up he's already unifying and his poll numbers are going up. If the democrats have a bitter nomination process they will have their own versions of #NeverBernie and #NeverHilllary. Their base will be divided and the party will have less time to heal and unify than the republicans.",

Over time the tone has changed as the trailing candidate has increasingly needed to diminish his opponent in order to get ahead. The leading candidate's interests are never served by attacking downward, so it doesn't make sense to view Hillary as the source of the rift (to whatever extent it exists). \n\nAs an admirer of both candidates, it's been disappointing to see her integrity called into question without any real evidence. \n\nI raised my anecdotal experience, not to start an endless argument about the campaigns or their supporters, but to help end it by pointing out that the unfounded negativity begets more negativity and it's unhelpful to both sides, liberal vs liberal or liberal vs conservative.",

So, the republicans want us to pay in for 30 years while we work but find it morally wrong for us to collect the promise made, after retirement. Oh and don't forget all the money they pulled from the social security funds along the years for other projects. Had that money been left as it should have been, it would have earned enough to be far more than solvent. Question arises, would it be morally wrong to pay back those borrowed funds?????",

Has he ever not rented his properties to any class of people, or kept anyone out of his hotels? Far from being a warmongerer, he was against the war in Iraq. A war which Clinton was not only in favor of, but ENTHUSIASTICALLY in favor of. Check out the videos of her Senate speeches. \n\nI'm much more culturally comfortable with Clinton and she does have a lot of experience but its almost all bad experience. She brought us the wars in Iraq and Libya and Syria, all while running her illegal email server and conducting a lot of shady dealings out of the Clinton Global Foundation. People tell me that Sanders doesn't have enough experience but I would rather someone with 0 experience than that kind of experience. \n\nI don't know if you should vote for Trump, but I do know that you shouldn't vote for Clinton. \n\n*edited for spelling.

You have what is called \"normalcy bias,\" wherein you deny reality simply because you choose to be ignorant of the truth rather than do due diligence to destinguish fact from delusion.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias\n\nThe U.S. has been in a perpetual state of emergency since 1979:\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/22/president-obama-\nstates-of-emergency/16851775/\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/11/19/the-united-states-\nis-in-a-state-of-emergency-30-of-them-in-fact/\n\nThe SoE legislation was responsible for the Vietnam War draft, The Kent State shootings & overall crackdown on the 1960s civil rights movement, the gun confiscation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the deprivation of citizens right to privacy through the Patriot Act and many other American injustices.\n\nIf you want to get involved in activism & are a proponent for freedom & liberty, then you first need to direct all of your focus on amending the state of emergency legislation that has legalized dilution and deprivation of the inalienable rights of the citizenry; these laws are already unconstitutional, thus invalid; however, it is up to the citizens (city by city, state by state) to make official their assertion that they will not enforce nor accept laws that breach constitutional & inalienable natural rights by  nullifying all unconstitutional laws on the books.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/stateofemergencereferendum\n\nThe state of emergency laws are being abused in countries all over the world (Canda, France, Australia, Russia, UK, Brazil, etc...) and the governments have been CAUSING the pretext for the emergencies in order to initiate martial law-based temporary dictatorships. These same tactics were used in 1990's Russia by the KGB in what is known as \"War of Laws\" wherein state of emergency was abused as pretext to take away the rights of the citizenry & eventually resulted in the dissolution of the Soviet Union as all states were forced to secede due to confusion of law; the USA is currently on the same track as the Soviet Union was in the 1990s.\n\nState of Emergency legislation is to blame for most of the injustices of today. If you want to see change, you first need to amend or nullify the State of Emergency legislation to ensure citizens rights are not revoked the very moment we require them. (turmoil)\n\nThose who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it.\n\n\u201cThose who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.\u201d - Benjamin Franklin\n\nDo your research, it's all written in plain english:\n\nBibliography:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law#United_States\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed#In_the_United_States\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Laws\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Russian_constitutional_crisis\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia_(1991%E2%80%93present)",

        "comment": "True. It gets worse as more independent voters give up on the Sanders campaign and move over to support Trump. Not only is she losing a candidate that was a \"D\" primary voter that they very wrongly assumed they could count on for Clinton support once the convention is over but that vote is choosing to go support Trump so it's a net loss of two votes because many of those people are passionate voters that aren't going to stay home. \n\nThe best she can hope for is (other than people voting for her) is that they bail on the DNC and go vote for the Green party instead of Trump. Many of these people are the \"anyone but Clinton\" voters who media doesn't enjoy talking about nearly as much as the \"anyone but Trump\" voter but they exist - I'm one of them. I'm not even a political analyst but it's pretty easy to see that when you have an incredibly unpopular candidate *and* another liberal option, the conservative candidate is going to win. If you don't believe me, see the State of Maine governor, a wildly unpopular guy who won back to back elections not because of his popularity but because liberals and independents couldn't agree on a candidate so the vote was split and LePage won by default both times. You're about to see that on the national stage and the only way to have kept all of these voters who are now bleeding off to either not vote, vote Green or vote for Trump is to have nominated Sanders. The smart play by the DNC, if it wasn't run by that idiot Clinton employee DWS, would and could still be to make Sanders the nominee. The Clinton supporters are die hard democrats. They will begrudgingly vote for Sanders because they will vote \"D\" even if Trump was on the ticket. Sanders voters won't though. It's incredibly simple math that has been pretty obvious to everyone that ISN'T in power at the DNC for at least a good ten months or so. \n\nSo, unless something drastic happens at the convention or superdelegates continue to jump ship (three more pledged for Sanders last week), get ready for the White House to have a big \"TRUMP\" sign on top of it like he puts on his hotels because Clinton will be lucky if she does better than Mondale did.

Heck, you may be right anyway, since no matter what the FBI does Clinton won't pull back.   However, the FBI news might pull the super delegates away.  But those folks really don't want to back Sanders.   It will likely get interestinger and interestinger.",

Such as campaign finance bribery, gerrymandering, the debates being controlled by the parties, electronic voter fraud, registration disenfranchisement, centralizing profit based media, absurd ballot access laws, first past the post election format, and super delegates. Among other influences, like the revolving door of regulatory capture. \n\nWe're taxed, but not represented, because the only thing that incentivises accountability to the people, is compromised by wealthy elite, like those that participate in influence peddling, such as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The result of this has led to 40 years of growing income inequality, which systemically is intertwined with every other issue. While wealth and power has been centralizing, the government is getting more authoritarian. From military spending, to wars, to growing/privatizing prisons, to spy agencies eroding civil liberties, to militarized police. Both of these aspects, centralizing power and growing authoritarianism, are having severe effects on the quality of life both here and abroad.\n\nAn accountable government supersedes every other issue. No policy will change in your favor without one. Not healthcare, not environment, not education, not military, not trade, until politicians are more incentivised to work for the people, then for corporate donors. That means 1 person 1 vote. That means electoral accountability.\n\nThe question at this point is what to do about it, because that's what the Sanders campaign was for, so if he's done. It's over unless someone has some other ideas.\n\nBernie Sanders has to run third party, or pull a hat trick at the convention. Otherwise we're solidifying this fascist oligarchy ever deeper into our society. Likely past a point of no return.",

False Prophet for the last 50 years.\n\nSeveral times near New Year, Robertson has announced that God told him several truths or events that would happen in the following year. \"I have a relatively good track record,\" he said. \"Sometimes I miss.\"[69]\n1982: Doomsday\n\nIn late 1976, Robertson predicted that the end of the world was coming in October or November 1982. In a May 1980 broadcast of The 700 Club he stated, \"I guarantee you by the end of 1982 there is going to be a judgment on the world.\"[70]\n\nIn September 2011, Robertson and several others who incorrectly predicted various dates for the end of world were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for \"teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions and calculations\".[71][72]\n2004: Presidential election\n\nIn January 2004, Robertson said that God told him President Bush will be re-elected in a \"blowout\" in November. \"I think George Bush is going to win in a walk\", Robertson told viewers of his The 700 Club program. \"I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout election in 2004. It's shaping up that way.\"[73] Bush did in fact win re-election, but not in a landslide. The 2004 race between Bush and John Kerry was one of the closest large elections in history.[74]\n2006: Pacific Northwestern tsunami\n\nIn May 2006, Robertson declared that storms and possibly a tsunami would hit America's coastline sometime in 2006. Robertson supposedly received this revelation from God during an annual personal prayer retreat in January. The claim was repeated four times on The 700 Club.\n\nOn May 8, 2006, Robertson said, \"If I heard the Lord right about 2006, the coasts of America will be lashed by storms.\" On May 17, 2006, he elaborated, \"There well may be something as bad as a tsunami in the Pacific Northwest.\"[75] While this claim didn't garner the same level of controversy as some of his other statements, it was generally received with mild amusement by the Pacific Northwest media. The History Channel's initial airing of its new series, Mega Disasters, debut episode \"West Coast Tsunami\", was broadcast the first week of May.\n2007: Terror attack\n\nOn the January 2, 2007, broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson said that God spoke to him and told him that \"mass killings\" were to come during 2007, due to a terrorist attack on the United States. He added, \"The Lord didn't say nuclear. But I do believe it will be something like that.\"[76] When a terrorist attack failed to happen in 2007, Robertson said, in January 2008, \"All I can think is that somehow the people of God prayed and God in his mercy spared us.\"[77]\n2008: Worldwide violence and American recession\n\nOn the January 2, 2008 episode of The 700 Club, Pat Robertson predicted that 2008 would be a year of worldwide violence. He also predicted that a recession would occur in the United States that would be followed by a stock market crash by 2010.[77] However, there was a decrease in overall deaths for the period,[78] and the American economy had already entered a recession in 2007, with increased household debt[79] and the collapse of financial institutions.[80]\n2008: Mideast meltdown\n\nIn October 2008, Robertson posted a press release on the Georgian conflict speculating that the conflict is a Russian ploy to enter the Middle East, and that instability caused by a predicted pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran would result in Syria's and Iran's launching nuclear strikes on other targets. He also said that if the United States were to oppose Russia's expansion, nuclear strikes on American soil are also pending. \"We will suffer grave economic damage, but will not engage in military action to stop the conflict. However, we may not be spared nuclear strikes against coastal cities. In conclusion, it is my opinion that we have between 75 and 120 days before the Middle East starts spinning out of control.\"[81]\n2009: Economic chaos and recovery\n\nOn the January 1, 2009 broadcast of The 700 Club, Robertson said, \"If I'm hearing [God] right, gold will go to about $1900 an ounce and oil to $300 a barrel.\" He also suggested that Americans would broadly accept socialism. Despite these predictions, he also said that economically \"things are getting ready to turn around.\"[82]\n2012: Presidential election\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Robertson reported that God had spoken to him and he \"thinks He showed me the next president\" but would not name who it is.[83] He did give an indication that it would not be President Obama since Robertson said God told him Obama's views were at \"odds with the majority\", but left some room for interpretation had the 2012 election expanded beyond a two-person race.[84] Closer to the election, however, he expressly stated that God had told him that Mitt Romney would win and would be a two-term President.[85]",

The Prophet added, 'Certainly I decided to order the Mu'adh-dhin (call-maker) to pronounce Iqama and order a man to lead the prayer and then\u00a0take a fire flame to burn all those who had not left their houses so far for the prayer along with their houses.'\"\u00a0Muhammad orders his men to burn alive those who do not present themselves at the mosque for prayer\n\nMuhammad was a war lord who spread Islam through the sword, and Allah constantly reminds readers that nonbelievers will face immeasurable suffering due to eternal hell fire.  To act like there is no conceivable way a Muslim could get the impression violence is possibly permitted when the Quran and other works explicitly give conditions for war, describes the suffering of nonbelievers in the afterlife, and describe Muhammad's violent crusades is flat out wrong.

If you think \"brutal\" describes him in any way then you are simply vastly ignorant of history and I suggest you find a more neutral source to learn more.

I'm showing you a transcript and you are rejecting it claiming yours is different but refuse to show me it and tell me to talk to his PR team.\n\n>Go on and show me a single Muslim scholar who agrees with that claim. \n\nWas Muhammad not clear enough that it takes appeals to authority to decipher what he said?  Did Allah write his perfect word in a dead language that cant be properly translated?\n\n>Not even ISIS burns people for not praying. \n\nWell I never said they did...\n\n>Your Citation is factually inaccurate and is from a dubious site (and you think r/Islam is biased but that hate site you copy pasted from is somehow trustworthy and evenhanded?)\n\nStill haven't told me what the \"true\" translation that is trustworthy is.\n\n>and is not at all what is said in Arabic\n\nAnd you told me earlier no one needs to read the Arabic version.

The Democrats are pushing for two things here because of Orlando\n\n*** Denial of Firearms to those on a Terror Watch List** - The problem is, the Orlando shooter wasn't on a watchlist. The FBI removed him after investigating him for 10 months and they couldn't prove anything.\n\n* **Universal Background Checks** - The problem is, the shooter bought his guns at a gun store, where he was background checked.  He had a concealed carry permit, for which he was background checked.  He had a state firearms license, for which he was background checked.  He was\nalso an armed security guard for a government contractor which required an active security clearance, for which he was (you guessed it) background checked.\n\nWhy the fuck are we pushing for laws using 49 dead people and 53 wounded when none of these laws would have prevented it from happening, and the Senators pushing for them even admit they wouldn't have stopped the shooting?!?!?!",

The M16 military rifle is. \n\n>Then some of them feel the need to terrorize the local wildlife like coyotes, fox, armadillos, and rattlesnakes with some big, badass gun\n\nFirst off your comment about terrorizing the local wildlife makes you sound like a buffoon. I get it you don't like hunting. But just because you don't like it doesn't mean it doesn't have valid purposes, especially on a ranch where you need to defend your livestock.\n\nThe ar15 is by no means big. What in your mind makes the ar15 so big and bad compared to other rifles? It uses such a small caliber it isn't legal for deer hunting in many states. It fires semi automatic, just like many shotguns and other rifles. Just because its black doesn't make it some super weapon. And as mentioned, its not a military weapon because it isn't selective fire. Its no different than any other semi automatic rifle, it just looks like military versions. But do looks actually make anything more dangerous?",

Mass killings. Evil people will kill people if they desire. They will use guns, or planes, or bombs. Its not framing it with a point of view. Its specific to the issue of mass shootings. \n\n>Do you have a reference for that? \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/gun-deaths-are-mostly-suicides.html?_r=0\n\n>we're still significantly higher than all the other countries, which means that we should consider taking steps to be more like those countries.\n\nSome would argue that the difference between our countries and other countries is what made us the largest economy and biggest superpower in the world. I'm not saying an armed population is part of that, but its one of our founding values so its comparable that some of us want to hold onto those values.  \n\n>You seem to be throwing that out there as if it makes that component of the statistics meaningless. Oh, I get it now. Here's where you're going with this:\n\nNo. I am again pointing this to the argument of regulation and mass shootings. No one is talking about regulating semi automatic pistols, though they are far and away the most commonly used weapons in gun violence. Criminals don't follow laws. So the idea that if it was illegal to sell a gun on the street without a background check would thereby stop gangbangers is illogical. \n\n>Is that about right?\n\nNo. That is not right. \n\n>Half of gun deaths are suicides, so they don't hurt anyone else with guns and can be ignored.\n\nThe fact a gun was used can be ignored. Japan has a much higher suicide rate than the US. They don't have guns. People will kill themselves in other ways. The gun isn't the problem, the fact people are suicidal is.  \n \n>Mostly, only black people kill each other with guns, so why take away the guns from white people, too?\n\nThat is racist and makes no sense. Pointing out the facts that innercity gangbangers do most of the killing does not mean that guns should not be taken away from white people. \n\n>Mass shootings don't count because they'd make your statistics worse.\n\nWhat statistic are you referring too? Mass shootings count towards gun violence of course. But they are a tiny tiny sliver of gun violence. You have a better chance of being killed by Bees than in a mass shooting.  \n\n>Why do you believe that your hobby is important enough to allow such easy access to homicide?\n\nI believe that the constitution guarantees Americans to right to defend themselves from the government and criminals. I believe that is a right that should be preserved. I dont believe that guns are the reason for homicides in our country. I believe it has to do with poverty, mental health, and the mass media. There are other nations with easy access to guns that do not have our level of gun violence.  \n  \n>This actually makes your argument worse because gun violence is so ingrained that we don't consider it news-worthy.\n\nNo. The media feeds off fear. No one gets scared of inner city violence. But a mass shooting they can play up as an epidemic that could happen any moment to anyone. That sells advertising. The real issue is inner city violence, but thats much more difficult to cure and it doesn't strike fear. So it doesn't get airtime. \n\n>hobbyists... are responsible for giving the NRA enough power to bypass the will of the people on this.\n\nHobbyists as you call them, are not part of the people? I think you confuse the will of the people. Youre blindness makes you think that the general population actually wants Americans disarmed, this is false. \n\n>or start taking the \"well-regulated militia\" part into account.\n\nPlease tell me you think well regulated milita means something other than well equipped able body male.

He has no livestock - he's a tech writer/editor. Moving to a newly fragmented ranch and going out and killing the wildlife that lives there for no reason is not hunting.  \n\nThere is no reasoning with gun fondlers like you. The AR-15 and the like were developed for combat use. The fact that they're not fully automatic or that lots of civilians own them doesn't change the fact that this is a weapon designed for combat. For killing as many people as possible in the most efficient manner. It wasn't developed for hunting or home security. People like you love the AR-15 because you're insecure and need some big, tough-looking gun to fill some man-child need. It's pathetic and costing lives every day.",

        "comment": "Youre just so off base my friend. The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in America. You really think thats because everyone is insecure and a man child? Or do you think that could be because it is one of the most highly customizable rifles available. It comes in multiple calibers (its not an ar15 in calibers other than 223 but the design is the same), can be fitted with many barrels, sights, stocks. It can be configured for hunting, for protection, for competition. \n\nThose that are uninformed like yourself feel that it is \"designed for combat use.\" I dont really know what that means. Combat rifles are select fire. That is really the only thing that makes them a combat rifle. Otherwise they fire cartridges the same as any rifle you might consider a \"hunting rifle\". It is just a semi automatic rifle. \n\nPlease enlighten me by telling me how it is more lethal or better for combat than other semi automatic rifles? What you should actually do is tell me what defines an \"assault rifle\". When all that makes something an assault rifle is superficial items like stocks, pistol grips, flash hiders, but nothing about caliber, rate of fire, magazine size, it seems like a pretty poor argument.

        "comment": ">The argument is that regulations aren't going to stop mass shootings. Mass killings.\n\nThat's the argument that you're trying to have, but not the one I am interested in having with you, since mass shootings aren't the main contributor to gun deaths. They raise awareness of the problem, though.\n\n>>Do you have a reference for [half of all homicides in the US being suicides]? \n>http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/gun-deaths-are-mostly-suicides.html?_r=0\n\nDid you read this?\n\n\"When Americans think about deaths from guns, we tend to focus on **homicides**. But the problem of gun **suicide** is inescapable: More than 60 percent of people in this country who die from guns die by suicide.\" (emphasis mine)\n\nYour argument was that half of _homicides_ included _suicides_. The article you linked to makes a distinction between the two. You'd have to show that the sources used for the article I linked you to included suicides in with the homicides.\n\n>Some would argue that the difference between our countries and other countries is what made us the largest economy and biggest superpower in the world.\n\n'Murrica.\n\n>I'm not saying an armed population is part of that\n\nI surely hope you don't even _think_ that.\n\n>but its one of our founding values so its comparable that some of us want to hold onto those values. \n\nSlavery was, too. It was so ingrained in the culture of the founders, that when they wrote that all men were created equal, they didn't even bother to explain what they meant by that, since they saw black people as sub-human. You may be aware that we amended the Constitution to repeal slavery.\n\n>I am again pointing this to the argument of regulation and mass shootings.\n\nMake that argument all you want.\n\n>No one is talking about regulating semi automatic pistols, though they are far and away the most commonly used weapons in gun violence. Criminals don't follow laws. So the idea that if it was illegal to sell a gun on the street without a background check would thereby stop gangbangers is illogical. \n\nOnly if you take a short-term perspective. If guns are _illegal_ then they will start with a buyback program, melting them down (after performing the necessary forensics to see if they're tied to crimes). Then they will include searches for firearms in any warrant, melting down any they find. Over time, the gun supply will decrease.\n\n>People will kill themselves in other ways. The gun isn't the problem, the fact people are suicidal is.\n\nHave you ever considered the amount of effort involved? Many suicidal people can't muster the motivation to hang themselves, but it's really easy to shoot themselves. It's also painless to die of a good head shot, but not a hanging.\n\n>That is racist and makes no sense. Pointing out the facts that innercity gangbangers do most of the killing does not mean that guns should not be taken away from white people. \n\nYou are the one who framed this as \"black on black\" homicide and are now trying to backpedal your racist framing of the problem as geographical.\n\n>You have a better chance of being killed by Bees than in a mass shooting.\n\nIn a _mass_ shooting, possibly. What are the statistics on random gun violence vs random bee violence?\n\n>I believe that the constitution guarantees Americans to right to defend themselves from the government and criminals.\n\nIt's impossible to defend yourself from the government using force. Have you looked at the statistics about whether or not owning a gun makes you more or less likely to die?\n\n>I dont believe that guns are the reason for homicides in our country.\n\nCrimes consist of motive and opportunity. Guns create _lots_ of opportunity that wouldn't have been there otherwise. You're correct that motive is a separate factor.\n\n>Hobbyists as you call them, are not part of the people? I think you confuse the will of the people. Youre blindness makes you think that the general population actually wants Americans disarmed, this is false. \n\nMost Americans want a lot more regulation on the sale of guns. I am proposing something far more radical - actually taking away your right to own guns. Why? Well, it's a technique I learned from the right wing, actually. Make your apparent position extreme, then get the other side to compromise in the direction of your actual position.\n\nYou also didn't explain to me why your hobby is more valuable than lives that would be saved by eliminating guns.\n\n>Please tell me you think well regulated milita means something other than well equipped able body male. Please. It will show how completely ignorant and ill informed you are. \n\nA militia is a _group_. The Constitution says that this group has to be \"well regulated.\" What do _you_ think that means?

He is, after all a businessman, and there's no return on this investment. It's sad to say that he's \"the peace candidate\" in this election, but the fact remains that he is.",
