        "num_comments": 4,
        "description": "Ms. Cantwell, I would like you to listen to me. And DON'T REPLY WITH A FORM LETTER. I want a PERSONAL RESPONSE from you.\n\nYou know the shootings of Police Officers in Dallas. While the political timing is bad, the political \"establishment\" needs to consider the underlying cause of this mess.\n\nThe two shootings of black men who were not causing trouble.\n\nThe lack of police reform being enacted.\n\nI propose a FEDERAL STANDARD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT HIRING PRACTICES.\n\nI hear from friends who have worked in the military, then went into Law Enforcement. Many of them say that quite a few of the officers who joined the force from a civilian background are the ones who are nuts. That is to say, they are people who tried to join the U.S. Military to live out their fantasy of being G.I. Joe, and were washed out in either basic or because they were mentally unfit for duty.\n\nIt is this point I would like to hammer home: Many of our law enforcement officers from civilian backgrounds do NOT meet the military standards for discipline, professionalism, and honor.\n\nIt is with this point in mind that I want to propose the following: Enact a bill into law requiring all law enforcement agencies to adhere to standards analogous to the United States Military's screening practices for their soldiers, sailors, aviators, and marines. If the officer is found unfit for \"armed duty\", they can serve as backup security, desk jobs, receptionists, and so on - but NEVER armed.\n\nBear in mind that the Police Unions will try to push back against this bill, and I would like to personally tell them to go f*ck themselves. They have a proven track record of repeatedly defending (and even helping to acquit) officers who have misbehaved in public, even cops who have killed non-threatening citizens of the United States. The \"Brotherhood\" mindset of the Police Union is a pox upon this country and the profession of policing, and needs to be expunged. In the early days, it was a fine concept, but now it threatens to prevent true police reform from happening.\n\nSo in closing, Ms. Cantwell: I would like to ask you to invite me to your office, so that we can discuss writing the bill in detail and submitting it to the United States Congress. And I am willing to speak on behalf of the bill, as well. Be warned, however: I am unlikely to be \"politically correct\" - for when I get angry at how pathetic our political and law enforcement establishments have gotten, I will use creative adjectives to describe what I am seeing.\n\nThis is a bill that should have bipartisan support...but I will NOT permit loopholes - ever. If someone tries to stick a loophole into it, I will find that person, and send him for a surprise swim in the gods-damned Potomac!\n\nI look forward to hearing a response from you. However, again, if your response is a \"form-letter\" drafted by your desk jockeys, I will immediately regard that response as to mean that you will protect the current police establishment in its present form, and that - I assure you - will not have a positive impact on the future of America.\n\nTo wit, I expected that eventually someone to get mad enough to grab his hunting rifle and shoot a bunch of police officers over the policing crisis. I have that kind of foresight - and I know you politicians have that foresight too, but it feels like you are deliberately turning a blind eye to what's happening in this country just to benefit yourselves.\n\nIdiots.\n\nSincerely, Sean D.\n\nP.S. I am posting this open letter on Reddit.\n\n> Context: Submitter is a Washington Resident, and has been observing the United States, Europe, and the Middle East for the past five to ten years - and he is mighty f*cking disappointed in humanity. (Also, crossposted from: https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalActivism/comments/4rt5aj/an_open_letter_to_senator_maria_cantwell_the )\n\n> WhiteHouse.GOV petition is up: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/we-demand-federal-standard-police-officers-be-instituted-across-united-states"

After looking into Hillary and how Bernie was cheated I really dug up information on her.. she is pure evil... but so is Donald Trump. I kinda like Gary Johnson.. I like the libertarian ideals for the most part and he's got more experience than Jill. It seems most democrats I know will reluctantly vote in Clinton, but most trump supporters are excited as can be to vote for him. I'm afraid of what a Clinton or trump presidency could hold for the future. I fear Clinton will silence free speech. I fear Donald will give too much power to his VP who if I understand correctly is one of those super Christian anti drug republicans.. I'm an atheist so I really just want to know that separation of church and state is important to candidates. I also want freedoms.. I don't think drug use or sale should cause a jail sentence. I want free flow of information I already notice twitter and YouTube favoring Clinton and deleting negative information."

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "The latest WikiLeaks document dump \u2014 containing emails by high-ranking staffers of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 caused considerable heartburn for America\u2019s oldest political party. But what\u2019s just as interesting is the dog that didn\u2019t bark \u2014 the fact that wasn\u2019t regarded as a scandal but perhaps ought to have been.\n\nEven casual political observers can see that labor union leadership and the Democratic Party are allied. AFL-CIO boss Richard Trumka spoke at the convention the other night, endorsing Hillary Clinton and calling the Republican nominee \u201cwrong, wrong, wrong\u201d for America.\n\nYet the emails that have been released highlight the rather one-way relationship between the Democratic Party and labor unions. DNC staffers see the unions as good soldiers in skirmishes with Republicans, as a pain when it comes to getting things done and, ultimately, as pushovers.\n\nWhen brainstorming what to do about last week\u2019s Republican National Convention, the DNC\u2019s Rachel Palermo urged her party to \u201cmeet with the hotel trades, SEIU, and Fight for 15 about staging a strike.\u201d She said the result could be a \u201cfast food worker strike around the city or just at franchises around the convention.\u201d The aim would not be to improve working conditions, but to bloody Republicans.\n\nAlternately, the DNC could \u201cinfiltrate friendly union hotels and properties around the convention that Republicans will be patronizing to distribute \u2018care\u2019 packages\u201d \u2014 probably not chocolates.\n\nPalermo also noted that \u201cSEIU has space in downtown Cleveland close to convention that can be the base of operations and host the wrapped mobile RV.\u201d\n\nThe union-DNC alliance does impose a few constraints on the DNC, which staffers both mocked and worked to circumvent. DNC staffer Katja Greeson, for instance, complained about delays involved in getting new business cards printed.\n\nShe explained to an irked communications director that sending work to union shops caused delays. \u201cBelieve me \u2014 it is equally frustrating to us,\u201d she said. Greeson also threatened \u201cif they can\u2019t deliver,\u201d DNC staffers would \u201cgo to FedEx Kinkos\u201d and do it themselves.\n\nThe DNC pledges to use only unionized hotels. But it turns out there\u2019s a workaround for that, too. Trey Kovacs, who has done yeoman\u2019s work spelunking through the DNC WikiLeaks dump, uncovered this one. In an exchange over whether they could use the non-union Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., a DNC staffer says they could just get a \u201cwaiver\u201d to use it.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear from the emails how or what circumstances must arise to obtain a waiver, but it seems that convenience for the chairman trumps loyalty to adhering to some kind of internal guidelines of exclusively patronizing unionized establishments,\u201d Kovacs, a policy analyst for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told me Wednesday.\n\nBecause this document dump has emails both to and from the DNC, we also hear from the unions themselves, which might explain why the party can count on their support come-what-may.\n\nFor instance, Sandra Lyon of the American Federation of Teachers asked for any \u201cregular talking points\u201d the DNC might have to pass on to AFT folks who speak with the media.\n\nAnd the National Education Organization\u2019s political communications director Michael Misterek wrote longingly to the DNC in May, \u201cI\u2019m hoping we can sit down to meet some time soon, over coffee or a cocktail. I\u2019d love to figure out how we can work together and be most helpful to each other these next few months.\u201d\n\nJeremy Lott is an adjunct scholar at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.\n\nhttps://archive.is/9Fmgl\n"

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "Until the late 1960s, you could walk into a post office and deposit money in a savings account at the same time that you bought stamps or mailed packages.\n\nAn outgrowth of the financial panic of 1907, the no-frills postal bank surged in popularity during the Great Depression. But as commercial banks expanded and offered higher interest rates, the United States Postal Savings System became as outdated as a black-and-white movie.\n\nNow, in the wake of another financial crisis, there's a new push for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver basic banking services again.\n\nThe effort is led by consumer advocates, financial reform groups, postal labor unions and some leading liberals, such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). They say that offering services such as paycheck cashing, bill payment and free ATMs would provide cash-strapped consumers with an affordable alternative to payday, auto-title and other short-term loans that have been criticized for high fees.\n\n\"We have millions and millions of low-income people who have to go to these payday lenders and pay outrageous interest rates. They're getting ripped off right and left,\" Sanders said on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" in October.\n\n\"We can have our Postal Service provide modest banking to low-income people where they can cash their checks and they can do banking,\" Sanders said. \"I think it will help the post office and it will help millions of low-income people.\"\n\nThe Postal Service's inspector general's office agrees. It estimates that expanding financial services beyond the current limited offerings, which include money orders and international funds transfers, could pump $8.9 billion a year into the financially struggling agency.\n\n\"The Postal Service has a public mission to serve citizens and support the growth of commerce,\" the inspector general's office said in a report last spring that presented five potential approaches for expanded banking services. \"And while it is required to cover its costs, profit is not its key motive.\"\n\nThe American Postal Workers Union has formed a coalition, the Campaign for Postal Banking, that in December delivered a petition with more than 150,000 signatures to Deputy Postmaster General Ronald A. Stroman urging the agency to expand its financial offerings.\n\n\"Big banks are turning their backs on families,\" union President Mark Dimondstein said. \"Without bank accounts, they fall prey to predatory lenders.\"\n\nPostmaster General Megan J. Brennan hasn't ruled out the idea of expanded banking services after her predecessor dismissed the suggestion in January as he headed into retirement. But she has some reservations.\n\n\"While we currently provide our customers with certain financial services, including money orders, electronic funds transfers and cashing of U.S. Treasury checks, our core function is not banking,\" the agency said in a written statement. Get our weekly business news briefing >>\n\nThe service said it has an \"infrastructure that is not ideal as a banking platform,\" and cited a decline in visits to post offices. Plus, any investments outside of its core function of mail delivery \"will likely be scrutinized from both public policy and regulatory perspectives,\" the agency added.\n\nThe Postal Service is an independent agency that since 1971 has been required to rely on sales of stamps and other services to pay for its operations. But the growth of the Internet and competition from private shippers, such as FedEx Corp. and UPS, have taken a major toll on the agency's finances.\n\nAfter peaking in 2006, total mail handled by the Postal Service has declined 27%. That has led to budget deficits, exacerbated by a congressional requirement to pre-fund retirement benefits for its workers, that have forced the agency to borrow up to its allowable limit of $15 billion from the U.S. Treasury.\n\nExpanded financial services offer \"the single best opportunity for new revenue,\" according to the inspector general's office.\n\nIt's not a far-fetched idea. Post offices in many other nations, including Britain, France, China and Japan, also serve as banks. And from 1911 to 1967, the United States Postal Savings System offered accounts with annual interest capped at 2%, to reduce competition with commercial banks.\n\nDeposits at U.S. postal banks surged during the Great Depression and World War II, when many consumers viewed the accounts as more secure than those in commercial banks. But as those banks opened more branches and increased interest rates after the war, the postal banking system fell out of favor and the federal government shut it down.\n\nThe Great Recession has led to calls for the revival of postal banks as many cash-strapped households have been forced to seek payday loans and other alternative financial products.\n\nA Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. survey found that about 9.6 million households in 2013 had no one with a bank account. An additional 24.8 million households had accounts but also used alternative financial services, such as payday loans.\n\n\"It's harder for people with less money to use their money, and much more expensive,\" said Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of Georgia professor and author of the book \"How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation and the Threat to Democracy.\"\n\nMany poor areas lack bank branches, but most communities have a post office, said Katherine Isaac, a consultant to the postal workers union who has been organizing the Campaign for Postal Banking.\n\n\"Even if we put all the payday lenders out of business, there's a concern that there's still no place to go,\" Isaac said. \"The banks aren't there. They've abandoned those communities. But the post office is there.\"\n\nThe Postal Service is the most popular federal agency \u2014 84% of respondents have a positive view of it, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll.\n\n\"I would guess that a lot of people would trust the post office teller with their money more than these Wall Street traders,\" said Baradaran, an advocate for postal banks. \"There's a sense that the post office is a dinosaur, but it's not a shark.\"\n\nCongress would have to pass legislation allowing post offices to take deposits and make loans. But the Postal Service could use existing authority to increase some offerings, such as expanding check cashing to include other government and payroll checks and broadening money orders into bill payment service, supporters said.\n\n\"This is not a cash cow for the post office,\" Baradaran said. \"But it could save them.\"\n\nSee also: http://www.campaignforpostalbanking.org/\n"

        "num_comments": 2,
        "description": "By Mike LaBella mlabella@eagletribune.com\n\nHAVERHILL \u2014 A display of Donald Trump campaign signs at a Kenoza Avenue home so angered a woman walking in Winnekenni Park that she marched right over and began pulling the signs from the ground.\n\nThe homeowner, Richard Early III, was inside Saturday when his dogs barked. He looked out to see a woman pulling Trump signs out of his front lawn. \n\n\"She was carrying six signs under her arm,\" he said. \n\nThe woman, Roxette Caba, 26, of 45 Brook St., told The Eagle-Tribune that she removed some of the Trump signs from Early's front lawn out of a sheer emotional reaction.\n\n\"To be honest, I have no preference in a candidate,\" Caba said. \"I was not fueled politically, but instead emotionally... the way Trump talks about women and people of color. I'm Dominican, and Trump denigrates people of color as lazy. I'm working on my master's degree and to say the things he says is just ugly.\"\n\nEarly said he confronted Caba and warned her to leave the signs alone and to leave his property or else he would call the police.\n\n\"She continued to remove my signs so I had to call police,\" Early said. \"I didn't want her arrested, but she would not leave my property.\"\n\n\"She kept talking about being \"the movement,\" whatever that means and said 'I'm taking your signs.'\"\n\nPolice arrived at the Kenoza Avenue home Saturday and, according to their report, found Caba acting in a \"highly agitated and animated way.\"\n\nCaba was yelling obscenities at Early and was throwing his \"Trump\" political signs around his yard, police said.\n\nPolice said Caba was also yelling obscenities at a neighbor, who was in his own yard with his small children, who police said appeared terrified.\n\nPolice said passers-by were stopping their vehicles to see what was going on and watched as Caba continued her tirade, \"clearly agitated that the victim had 'Trump' political signs displayed in his yard.\"\n\nAfter Caba told police that she was \"exercising her political right,\" police asked her, 'What about his (the victim's) political rights?\"\n\nCaba responded, \"Who cares, he's a bigot.\" \n\nPolice told Caba that even if that was true, \"did it mean the victim had no right to his own political view?\"\n\nCaba works at a Lawrence mental health provider as an early intervention counselor for children and families. She was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. \n\nCaba was arraigned on the charge on Monday in Haverhill District Court, where she waived her right to counsel and pleaded guilty to the charge. \n\nJudge Stephen Abany fined Caba $50 and assessed a $50 victim/witness fee. The judge noted that her case will be dismissed upon payment of the fine and fee by Nov. 1.\n\nCaba said she has since paid those court costs.\n\nCaba said she had just completed a walk Saturday at Winnekenni Park when she noticed Early's many Trump signs and that they triggered a sudden, emotional reaction.\n\n\"I saw the house and the signs and I'd had enough,\" Caba said. \"I was on the sidewalk, and his lawn is lifted up, and I'm tall so I pulled out a few signs and he came out of his house five seconds later. I told him I was taking down his signs, then I tried to have a conversation with him.\"\n\n\"I did not intend to damage or steal the signs, just stack them up and ask him to tone down his display,\" Caba said. \"I was yelling a bit, as he was saying racial slurs and I did get a little disorderly.\"\n\nCaba said she wanted to have a conversation with Early.\n\n\"I wanted to ask why he thought Trump would make a good president,\" Caba said. \"He just walked away and was on his phone. I told him if he believes that a racist ... would make a good president.\"\n\nCaba said she has never been arrested before but that it was worth getting arrested to make a statement about Trump.\n\n\"His signs are as hateful as Confederate flags,\" Caba said about Trump. \"When I see his signs I see women being abused ... For some reason, that house in particular really struck a nerve.\"\n\n\"There is no reason for Trump to be president,\" Caba said. \"His character is a recipe for disaster.\"\n\n\"I'm not a vagrant, I'm a law-abiding citizen who works and pays my bills on time and I just wanted to make a statement,\" she said. \"I did what I did but I won't do it again. It was his property and if someone did that to me I'd be angry, too.\"\n\nEarly said his Trump signs have attracted a lot of unwanted attention. He set up a dozen small signs on his lawn about 10 months ago along with a very large \"Trump\" sign and a few other signs and since that time he's come under siege by people he says are determined to steal or damage them. \n\nHis home across from Winnekenni Park is hard to miss when driving by as there are many Trump signs in various sizes.\n\n\"I expect it's only going to get worse,\" Early said. \"The signs are on my property and I have the right to exercise my rights. A neighbor on Concord Street at the end of Midlake Street has a Hillary sign, which he has the right to have. I don't care what he does.\"\n\nEarly said that since installing the Trump signs three people have been arrested for stealing them. He said a recent high school graduate walked away with a dozen of his signs on June 25.\n\n\"I have a video surveillance system that caught him taking them,\" Early said. \"He admitted it to police, who said they would summons him to court.\"\n\n\"The kid told police that he was a Bernie supporter and that he'd been watching my house for a month and that he doesn't like Trump,\" Early added. \"I got back eight of those signs.\" \n\nA few weeks ago a woman was tossing some of Early's Trump campaign signs into the street, stopping traffic, and a passer-by called police.\n\n\"They arrested that woman,\" Early said.\n\n\"On July 1, I chased two juveniles and two teenagers into Winnekenni Park,\" he said. \"They were dropping the signs as I was chasing them. I've never seen anything like this. It's been a circus up here.\"\n\nhttps://archive.is/1POAA"

        "num_comments": 1,
        "description": "https://archive.is/L1OAo\n\nWorkers Vanguard No. 1093 29 July 2016\n\nFreedom Now for Chelsea Manning!\n\nChelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst convicted for exposing evidence of U.S. imperialism\u2019s monstrous war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, has now entered her seventh year in military custody. Having leaked a vast cache of military and state secrets to WikiLeaks\u2014a valuable service to humanity\u2014Manning was sentenced in 2013 to 35 years for violating the Espionage Act. The courageous 28-year-old Manning has already endured the most severe punishment ever inflicted on any whistle-blower. The Obama administration\u2019s ruthless, punitive war against truth-tellers like Manning, Edward Snowden and Julian Assange is aimed at silencing any and all who dare expose or oppose the U.S. government\u2019s atrocities and mass surveillance.\n\nLocked away in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Manning attempted suicide on July 5. Displaying gross contempt, the U.S. Army released her confidential medical information to the media before notifying her lawyers. After being hospitalized, Manning was cut off from her legal team and family members for more than 36 hours. She tweeted subsequently that she was \u201cglad to be alive,\u201d but remains under close observation. Subjected to ongoing psychological torment and physical torture since her arrest in 2010, Manning has been driven to the brink of suicide more than once. She has spent long periods in solitary confinement. Before her conviction, she spent nine months in maximum isolation in the Marine Corps brig at Quantico, Virginia, where she was subjected to daily strip searches and forced nudity. Manning recently described the \u201cno touch\u201d torture there (Guardian, 2 May): \u201cFor 17 hours a day...I was not allowed to lay down. I was not allowed to lean my back against the cell wall. I was not allowed to exercise.\u201d\n\nIn May, Manning\u2019s lawyers completed an extensive 200-page appeal brief, challenging her conviction as \u201cgrossly unfair and unprecedented.\u201d A separate amicus brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union argues that Manning\u2019s prosecution was unconstitutional, citing the contrast with former Army general and CIA director David Petraeus, who handed over reams of classified information to his biographer, who was also his lover. The war criminal Petraeus barely received a slap on the wrist: two years probation and a fine.\n\nThrough a Freedom of Information Act request, Manning recently acquired documents on the government\u2019s \u201cInsider Threat\u201d program, which monitors internal communications of military personnel and civilian contractors. The program uses Manning\u2014who is transgender and was known as Bradley in the Army\u2014as a case study to suggest that those with \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d may be prone to aiding the enemy!\n\nIn prison, Manning is targeted by the imperialist rulers for her outspoken activism on government surveillance, prison conditions and transgender rights. In August 2015, shortly after starting her regular column in the Guardian and posting to Twitter, Manning was punished for possessing so-called contraband, i.e., \u201cunapproved\u201d reading material including the Caitlyn Jenner issue of Vanity Fair and literature relating to transgender identity. While ultimately spared indefinite solitary confinement, Manning was restricted for weeks from outside access and library use. Despite such measures, she has continued to speak out.\n\nA couple of weeks after her suicide attempt, Manning wrote a commentary titled, \u201cMoving On: Reflecting on My Identity,\u201d where she made a plea: \u201cI want to be seen and understood as the woman that I actually am\u2014with all of my flaws and eccentricities\u2014perhaps at the expense of what people expect me to be.\u201d For years, Manning has been suing the government to be allowed to live as a woman while she is transitioning. Though her lawyers successfully won her access to hormone treatment, she is still in an all-male facility. As with other transgender prisoners who are usually placed in prisons against their declared gender identity, the risk of violence and sexual assault is heightened.\n\nIt is urgently necessary to continue the fight to free Chelsea Manning, whose resistance is an inspiration to those who refuse to sit on their hands and keep quiet. As we wrote in \u201cTruth-Teller on Trial: Free Bradley Manning,\u201d (WV No. 1026, 14 June 2013): \u201cLifting the veil on the U.S. war machine was a gutsy act of conscience that objectively helps the victims and opponents of the imperialist system. But the workings of this society will not change by making more information publicly available.\u201d This system is based on the exploitation of labor for private profit, buttressed by systematic racial segregation and sexual oppression that divides the working people. The capitalist class maintains its rule through the force and violence of special bodies of armed men\u2014the police, military and prisons. It will take a series of workers revolutions around the world to overturn the capitalist order\u2014to which imperialist war and state repression are integral\u2014and replace it with an egalitarian socialist society.\n\nhttp://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1093/manning.html\n"

        "description": "https://archive.is/Ss72u Workers Vanguard No. 1093 29 July 2016\nBy Salah Shami\n\nFree State of Jones, starring Matthew McConaughey, is a historically accurate and inspiring account of a racially integrated rebellion in the Deep South against the Confederacy during the Civil War. Based on a true story, the movie illuminates one of the pages that had, until recent decades, been redacted from American history. It is the first movie that provides a truthful\u2014albeit too brief\u2014account of the period of Reconstruction following the Civil War. The Civil War and Reconstruction constituted the Second American Revolution. The war was a conflict between two social systems: Northern industrial capitalism and Southern slavery. The Union Army, which included 200,000 black troops who helped turn the tide of war, crushed the slave system. During Radical Reconstruction, black and white radicals of the Republican Party, protected by Union soldiers, sought to fulfill the promise of racial equality in the South. \n\nHowever, the victorious Northern bourgeoisie, in pursuit of its class interests, betrayed Reconstruction by making common cause with the vanquished Southern landholders. The defeat of Reconstruction has left a lasting imprint on American society: the black population was consolidated as an oppressed race-color caste, the majority of which is forcibly segregated at the bottom of society.\n\n\nThe movie tells the remarkable story of Newton Knight, an antislavery, pro-Union white farmer in Jones County, Mississippi. During the Civil War, Knight deserted the Confederate Army and led an integrated militia of escaped slaves and other white deserters that fought fierce battles against the Confederacy. They eventually raised the Union flag in Confederate president Jefferson Davis\u2019s home state, and declared Jones County and the surrounding area a free state. \n\nAs the movie unfolds, it tracks the evolution of Knight\u2019s consciousness\u2014from a disillusioned Confederate soldier to a defender of poor farmers, to a skilled and resourceful guerrilla war leader, to a militant defender of black rights during Reconstruction. To avoid conscription, Knight reluctantly enlisted in the Confederate Army, and chose to serve as a battlefield orderly attending to wounded soldiers rather than fire his rifle at Union troops. When the Confederate Congress passed the \u201cTwenty Negro Law,\u201d which exempted planters who owned 20 or more slaves from military service, Knight and his friend Jasper Collins were infuriated. The film shows Collins declaring that this law \u201cmakes it a rich man\u2019s war and a poor man\u2019s fight,\u201d as he threw down his weapon and left the Confederate Army for good. Newton soon followed Collins out of the Southern military, turning his back to the Confederacy and his guns against it.\n\nKnight returned to a home ravaged by the Confederacy\u2019s hated \u201ctax-in-kind\u201d seizures that left small farmers and their families destitute and near starvation. Appalled by these conditions, Knight decided to intercede on behalf of his neighbors, arming and training them to confront Confederate soldiers. In one scene, a mother and her young daughters, all armed under Knight\u2019s leadership, successfully barred tax agents from pillaging their farm. \n\nFor those efforts, Knight was pursued by the authorities and their bloodhounds, and he found refuge among a group of runaway slaves living deep in the swamps of Piney Woods. He was led to them by Rachel (portrayed by Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a domestic slave who provided the group with food and information on Confederate moves. She eventually became Knight\u2019s lover, and later they lived together as husband and wife. Soon Knight was joined by other deserters, among them Jasper Collins. As its ranks swelled, the band of deserters and runaway slaves organized themselves into a guerrilla force, elected Knight their captain and vowed to do what they could to aid the Union.\n\n\nThey ambushed Southern troops, destroyed railroads, burned bridges and raided plantations and food warehouses. In one powerful scene, armed men and women, black and white, avenge the execution of their comrades at the hands of Confederate officials by using the funeral as a cover to launch a surprise attack on Confederate soldiers.\n\n\nThe film powerfully shows the important role that arms have long played in the struggle for black rights\u2014and the rights of all the oppressed.\n\n\nIn the spring of 1864, the Knight militia chased the Confederate forces out of Jones County and raised the federal flag over the county courthouse in Ellisville. The film shows Knight enunciating a series of principles in declaring the Free State of Jones, including: \u201cEvery man is a man\u2014If you walk on two legs, you\u2019re a man\u201d and \u201cNo man ought to stay poor so another man can get rich.\u201d\n\n\nBy 1876, Knight had retreated to his farm on the Jasper County border. He and Rachel had five children together. Knight also fathered nine children with his first (white) wife, Serena, and the two families lived on the same farm. He deeded Rachel 160 acres of land to secure her independence. Newton Knight died in 1922 at the age of 84. Defying segregation laws, he instructed that he should be buried next to Rachel. His gravestone, with an emblem of his beloved shotgun, reads: \u201cHe Lived For Others.\u201d\n\n\nThe Myth of \u201cWhite Skin Privilege\u201d Free State of Jones has generated a fair amount of criticism, notably from some liberal black commentators who have screeched against its portrayal of Knight as a \u201cwhite savior.\u201d In a June 27 article, New York Times columnist Charles Blow claimed that the movie \u201ccenters on the ally instead of the enslaved.\u201d Blow willfully distorts the fact that it was the runaway slaves who saved Knight, not the other way around. They sheltered him, tended to his wounds and taught him how to survive in the swamps. Blow claims that the film \u201cpurges\u201d slavery \u201cof too much of its barbarism.\u201d \n\nYet much of the power of the film is precisely that it portrays slaves not just as tortured victims of a barbaric system\u2014though that reality is omnipresent\u2014but also as members of an organized force in rebellion against their oppressors. Newton Knight was not a fiction. He was a historical figure, and the movie accurately tells his story based on historical research, particularly Victoria Bynum\u2019s The Free State of Jones: Mississippi\u2019s Longest Civil War (2001).\n\n\nIn fact, the film punctures many of the myths that have long been promoted to bury the true history of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Under the racist ideology of the \u201clost cause,\u201d the South supposedly fought for home and independence, while the North fought for the Union\u2014with slavery all but written out of the account.\n\n\nReconstruction was deemed the worst period in U.S. history, born of a vindictive North that forced military rule on the South and imposed \u201cNegro domination.\u201d\n\n\nAs Gary Ross, the director of Free State of Jones, points out on the film\u2019s website, popular depictions of Reconstruction are captured by movies like Birth of a Nation (1915), \u201ca racist film that misleads, rewrites, and obscures the truth about Reconstruction.\u201d Similarly, Gone with the Wind (1939) mourns the destruction of the \u201cSouthern way of life\u201d in the wake of the war. In reality, the \u201clost cause\u201d of the Civil War was slavery, as Confederate leaders openly proclaimed at the time.\nYet today, Knight\u2019s race rankles in an age in which \u201cwhite skin privilege,\u201d the lie that all white people benefit from black oppression, has become common currency on college campuses and in liberal milieus. \n\nThis idea denies that class divisions exist within the white population and that racial oppression serves to deepen the exploitation of all workers. The horrific conditions of life\u2014rotten schools and dilapidated housing, widespread unemployment and low-wage jobs, no health care\u2014that blacks and immigrant workers have long endured are now increasingly faced by the working class as a whole. The mythology of \u201cwhite skin privilege\u201d is born of despair that rejects integrated class and social struggle to beat back the attacks of the capitalist rulers, or, at best, cannot even conceive of it.\n\n\nIn a hostile review in The Atlantic (28 June), Vann Newkirk wrote: \u201cThe film\u2019s ideas about race and its main character Knight are textbook examples of how not to have conversations about white privilege, \u2018allyship,\u2019 and black struggle.\u201d Newkirk charges that the film sidesteps \u201cthe racial politics of a mixed-race insurgency in the South\u201d and portrays the escaped slaves as being \u201cimpossibly trusting\u201d of Knight. In fact, the film does not shy away from depicting the race prejudice of some of the militia\u2019s white members\u2014and of Knight\u2019s struggle with them, notwithstanding the liberal lie that racial divisions are fixed and unalterable. \n\nWhether consciously or not, the film reflects the vitally important reality that united struggle by the oppressed tends to break down racial, ethnic and other divisions. Reconstruction: A Promise Betrayed While overwhelmingly accurate, Free State of Jones does have at least one serious inaccuracy. After raising the Union flag in Ellisville, the film shows Knight sending one of his men to Union general William T. Sherman to appeal for aid, but only getting 100 rifles. Feeling abandoned, Knight then addresses his supporters, telling them, \u201cwe\u2019re kinda our own country,\u201d and issues the decree establishing the Free State of Jones. \n\nActually, there is evidence that Sherman forwarded the support request up the chain of command and that there were several attempts by Union commanders to send aid, including 400 rifles, but they were captured by Confederate forces. As Knight himself explained in a 1921 interview, \u201cThe Federals sent a company to recruit us. That company was waylaid by some Confederates near Rocky Creek. It surrendered.\u201d\n\n\nThe movie also gives short shrift to the period of Reconstruction, though it contains scenes, some of them unique in Hollywood cinematography, that powerfully evoke the post-Civil War reality in the South. We see a plantation owner cynically pronouncing an oath of allegiance to the Union and then getting back his land. The scene refers to the period of Presidential Reconstruction immediately after the Civil War. That period began when Vice President Andrew Johnson, a virulent racist, assumed the presidency following the assassination of Lincoln in April 1865. Later that year, the 13th Amendment was ratified, abolishing slavery.\n\nHowever, Johnson carried out a policy of conciliation toward the South, amnestying leaders of the defeated Confederacy and returning them to power.\n\nMeanwhile, many Southern states enacted Black Codes that all but re-enslaved blacks. They included forced labor contracts, which specified that black \u201cservants\u201d who quit their jobs would be arrested and returned to their \u201cmasters,\u201d and vagrancy laws under which blacks could be arrested and \u201chired out\u201d to white employers if they couldn\u2019t prove they had a job. Another source of labor for white employers was provided by \u201capprenticeship\u201d laws whereby black children could be forcibly assigned to employers.\n\n\nKnight continued his fight during Reconstruction. In 1872 he was appointed deputy U.S. marshal for the Southern District, and in 1875 he became a colonel of the First Regiment Infantry of Jasper County, an otherwise all-black regiment. He was also assigned to rescue black children held by planters as virtual slaves. One scene shows Knight paying a plantation owner in order to free a black child who had been kidnapped and consigned to \u201capprenticeship.\u201d In reality, the freeing of \u201capprentices\u201d was often more forceful than depicted in the film.\n\n\nIn 1866, Congress passed the 14th Amendment, which defined citizenship for the first time in U.S. history and granted it to the former slaves. By the following year, Congress had taken control of Reconstruction, overriding Johnson\u2019s repeated vetoes and even impeaching him (though falling short of removing him from office by one vote). Radical Republicans in Congress carried out what became known as Radical Reconstruction\u2014or \u201cMilitary Reconstruction,\u201d as it is termed in the movie. That brief, tumultuous and extraordinary period was the most democratic and racially egalitarian in American history. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 and \u201968 placed the Southern states under military rule and imposed manhood suffrage without regard to race. The right of all male citizens to vote regardless of \u201crace, color, or previous condition of servitude\u201d was formalized nationally in 1870 with passage of the 15th Amendment. The former slaves voted enthusiastically at rates as high as 90 percent, sending 14 representatives to the House and two to the Senate (both from Mississippi). P.B.S. Pinchback, a black man, briefly served as governor of Louisiana. Nearly 700 black men sat in various state legislatures, and hundreds of others served in local posts, including as judges. For the first time, a public education system for black people as well as impoverished whites was established in the South, although the schools were largely segregated by race. Union Leagues organized the vote and self-defense against racist terror. They offered education in citizenship and protection in numbers.\n\n\nWhat made these achievements possible were the federal troops, many of them black, stationed in the South to suppress resistance by the former slavocracy, which was organized in the Democratic Party and its Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist auxiliaries. But while Radical Reconstruction provided unprecedented political rights for the former slaves, it did not address the fundamental question of land. Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens fought to break up the landed estates of the former slavocracy, and to redistribute the land to the freedmen and to landless whites, underlining that this would cement a political alliance between blacks and poor whites. But the American bourgeoisie was not interested in a thoroughgoing social reconstruction of the South. Whatever their views on political rights for black people, the vast majority of Republicans adamantly opposed land confiscation. The bourgeoisie\u2019s aim was not to create a class of independent black yeomen farmers but to get the black agricultural workforce back to toiling for the landowners.\n\n\nThe refusal to distribute land to the freedmen drove many back onto the plantations as sharecroppers and tenant farmers, where they were tied to the land through contracts and loans and forced into permanent debt peonage. The movie evokes that reality with a scene of former slaves toiling on a plantation under conditions of gang labor, not far removed from slavery. As calls for \u201creconciliation\u201d with the former Confederacy grew louder, the Northern bourgeoisie began a gradual retreat from Reconstruction. \n\nLaws disenfranchising former Confederate leaders were repealed. Quickly, the states fell under Democratic Party control. Scenes in Free State show KKK nightriders sowing terror and burning down a black church. Another scene shows a march of a mostly black Union League contingent on election day to cast their votes. The armed contingent forces local officials to accept their Republican ballots, which are then not included in the vote tally. The unstated background to that scene was the \u201cMississippi Plan,\u201d an open campaign of terror by the Democratic Party and its murderous auxiliaries that effectively destroyed the Republican Party in the South.\n\n\nThe fate of Reconstruction was finally sealed in the Compromise of 1877. In exchange for Republican Rutherford Hayes getting the presidency, the few hundred federal troops remaining in the South were pulled out. Some of those troops were dispatched to wage war on Native Americans. Others were sent to repress the Great Rail Strike of 1877, the first nationwide strike in the country. While the Compromise of 1877 was the culmination of a process of treachery by the bourgeoisie, it did represent a decisive statement by the federal government that it would no longer intervene on behalf of black people in the South.\n\n\nThe post-Reconstruction period, cynically called \u201cRedemption\u201d by racists, was marked by a political counterrevolution aimed at black people and enforced by race terror. Black people continued to tenaciously and courageously fight for their rights. But, abandoned by the capitalist rulers, they could not stem the reversal of their hard-won rights. \n\nWithin one to two decades, Southern states expanded the convict lease system and instituted rigid Jim Crow segregation, enforced through lynch law and given legal sanction with the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision. (See \u201cDefeat of Reconstruction and the Betrayal of Black Freedom,\u201d WV Nos. 1039 and 1040, 7 and 21 February 2014).\n\n\nFor Multiracial Class Struggle The story of Newton Knight\u2019s militia puts the lie to the claims of a unified Southern white populace and loyal slaves resisting the \u201cinvading Yankees.\u201d The farmers of Jones County were not alone in their opposition to the Confederacy. While most Southern whites supported slavery, only a quarter or so were slave owners. Many white farmers, forced to fight for a system in which they had no stake, turned against the Confederacy, especially in opposition to the seizure of their crops and livestock to support the war. Fully one-eighth of all Confederate troops deserted during the course of the war. \n\nCounties in western Virginia seceded in 1861 from the Confederacy and joined the Union in 1863 as a separate state, West Virginia. In East Tennessee, Unionists declared the state\u2019s secession null and void, and some 31,000 white Tennesseans joined the Union Army. The First Alabama Cavalry, a thousand-strong regiment, was the headquarters escort during Sherman\u2019s march to the sea. They were among the more than 100,000 white Southerners who served in the Union Army. Meanwhile, with every Union advance, countless slaves escaped the plantations, depriving the Confederacy of its labor force. The Civil War was the last great, progressive act of American capitalism, when, for a short time, the interests of the bourgeoisie coincided with those of black people in the fight against slavery. \n\nTo further the consolidation of industrial capitalism, the North was compelled to destroy the system of chattel slavery, which had become an obstacle to capitalist expansion. Slavery was smashed, but its legacy of racial oppression lives on as the bedrock of American capitalism. The legacy of slavery is invoked in scenes threaded throughout Free State of Jones that fast-forward to the 1948 trial and conviction of Knight and Rachel\u2019s great-grandson, Davis Knight. He was accused of \u201cmiscegenation,\u201d the racists\u2019 term for interracial marriage and sex. Two years before his trial, Davis had married a white woman. Based on the \u201cone drop of black blood\u201d rule, \u201canti-miscegenation\u201d laws were enacted throughout Southern states during the Jim Crow era. They remained on the books until 1967 when, at the height of the civil rights movement, the Supreme Court invalidated them in the landmark Loving v. Virginia decision. Karl Marx spoke the great truth about America when he wrote, \u201cLabor cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it is branded.\u201d The central enduring feature of American capitalism is the structural oppression of the black population. \n\nObscuring the fundamental class division between the capitalists who own the means of production and the working class who must sell their labor power to survive, racism and white supremacy have served to bind white workers to their capitalist exploiters based on the illusion of a commonality of interest based on skin color. But black or white, native-born or immigrant\u2014the whole of the working class has a common interest in combating black oppression and sweeping away the capitalist order. The key is to bring that understanding to the proletariat. The road to black liberation lies in the struggle to forge a revolutionary workers party that will lead the multiracial working class in the fight for socialist revolution, a third American revolution in which black workers are slated to play a leading role. \n\nhttp://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1093/jones.html\n"

        "description": "It all starts with a Wahhabi-Zionist lovefest.\n\nThe Saudi Foreign Ministry was forced to go on a non-denial denial overdrive about a visit to Israel on July 22 by a delegation led by retired Gen. Anwar Eshki.\n\nEshki happens to be close to Saudi intel superstar and onetime close Osama bin Laden pal Prince Turki bin Faisal, who recently met in the open with former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) generals Yaakov Amidror and Amos Yadlin.\n\nWhile in Israel, Eshki met with Foreign Ministry Director-General Dore Gold, and Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, the top IDF honcho in the West Bank.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no way the House of Saud would not have given a green light for such a visit \u2013 and such high-level meetings. By the way, the Interior Ministry in Saudi Arabia bans all travel to Israel \u2013 as well as Iran and Iraq.\n\nSo what\u2019s the big deal? The Israelis spun it as the Saudis \u2013 fronting for the Arab League \u2014 offering a normalization of ties with the Arab world without Israel abdicating from anything on the Palestinian front. The only thing Tel Aviv would have to do, much later, is to adopt the 2002, Saudi-proposed Arab peace initiative.\n\nThat\u2019s nonsense. For starters, the ultra right-wing Zionists in power in Tel Aviv will never accept reverting to the pre-1967 borders and recognizing the state of Palestine. What was \u201cdiscussed\u201d was a non-deal, even as Tel Aviv gloats, \u201cimportant Arab states are willing to openly embrace us even though we have not given up one inch of the West Bank and even as we continue to control Al-Aqsa Mosque.\u201d\n\nIf the Arab League would ever embark in such a blatant non-deal, forever throwing the Palestinians under myriad bulldozers, chances are oligarchies/petromonarchies all across the spectrum should start booking that one-way ticket to London.\n\nThat Moscow-Tehran-Ankara alliance\n\nSo what did they actually talk about? Predictably, the imminent prospect of the Full Spectrum Dominatrix finally taking over the White House.\n\nBoth Bibi Netanyahu in Tel Aviv and de facto House of Saud ruler and Prince of War Mohammad bin Salman in Riyadh have been reduced, under the Obama administration, to the status of proverbial, euphemistic \u201cestranged allies\u201d. Between them, they are de facto allies \u2013 even as they cannot admit it to the Arab street. Both are dead sure, under the Queen of War, there will be \u2013 what else \u2013 war. The question is against whom.\n\nInformed speculation points towards the Saudi/Israeli common enemy, Iran. That\u2019s complicated. The joint Saudi/Israeli strategy across the Middle East is indeed in tatters. Tehran has not been trapped in a quagmire neither in Syria nor in Iraq. ISIS/ISIL/Daesh and assorted \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d \u2013 covertly supported by the Saudi/Israeli axis \u2014 are on the run, even if they insist they are not \u201cal-Qaeda\u201d anymore. Prince of War bin Salman is entrapped himself in an unwinnable war on Yemen.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the spectacular post-coup pivot by Sultan Erdogan in Turkey \u2013 for all practical purposes abandoning those elaborate no-fly-zone dreams of annexing a post-Assad Syria to his neo-Ottoman set up.\n\nThe House of Saud is livid as Turkish diplomats have started to spread this blockbuster news: Erdogan has proposed to Iran\u2019s Rouhani an all-embracing alliance with President Putin to finally solve the Middle East riddle.\n\nWhatever erratic Erdogan\u2019s agenda may be, a possible ice-breaking new deal between Moscow and Ankara will be discussed de facto in the upcoming Putin-Erdogan face-to-face meeting. All geopolitical signs at this stage point \u2013 albeit tentatively \u2013 towards a revived Russia/Iran/Turkey alliance, even as a horrified House of Saud is going no holds barred to gain Moscow\u2019s trust by offering \u201cuntold wealth\u201d and privileged access to the GCC market.\n\nAs confirmed by a top Western intel source, \u201cthe Saudis are definitely keeping all contacts open with the Kremlin. The Saudi King is in Tangiers now and has met Russian envoys there. They mean what they say. But Putin will not abandon Assad. There has to be a compromise. Both need it.\u201d\n\nPresident Putin is in a privileged spot. Even without accepting the Saudi offer \u2013 which is just a promise, with no ironclad guarantees \u2013 Russia holds the best cards, as in a quite problematic but ultimately feasible Moscow-Tehran-Ankara alliance that is all about Eurasian integration (and a future seat for Turkey, alongside Iran, in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, SCO.)\n\nA Saudi-Moscow alliance for its part would inevitably lead a Queen of War administration towards \u2013 what else \u2014 regime change in Riyadh disguised as R2P; \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d the Saudi populace. One should expect Hillary crony Samantha Power to vehemently defend it at the UN.\n\nIt\u2019s all about The Three Harpies\n\nYet considering the Queen of War\u2019s instincts, all signs do point towards Iran.\n\nThe manual/blueprint/road map for Hillary\u2019s wars is arguably here, in this very dangerous intersection between US neocons and neoliberalcons. The CNAS think tank is led by one-third (Michele Flournoy) of what I have dubbed The Three Harpies; Hillary Clinton, Flournoy and \u2013 the most terrifying words in the English language \u2013 Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, the possible lethal trio in charge of foreign policy under a Clinton Three administration.\n\nThis is in fact PNAC (the Project for a New American Century) on steroids, with echoes of the warlike 1992 US Defense Planning Guidance disguised under the soothing rhetoric of benevolent hegemony and \u201crules-based international order\u201d. If the Trump campaign managed to restrain his motormouth and/or motortweet instincts and focus on what this warmongering opus means for the US and the world at large they would strike a chord with millions of undecided US voters.\n\nFor all her bluster, and that will be elevated to unheard-of hysterical levels, the Full Spectrum Dominatrix won\u2019t be foolish enough to launch a war \u2013 which will inevitably be nuclear \u2013 against either Russia (Baltics as a pretext) or China (South China Sea as a pretext), the Pentagon\u2019s top two \u201cexistential threats\u201d.\n\nIn Syria, on the other hand, by January 2017 al-Qaeda/not al-Qaeda goons formerly known as \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d will be mostly six feet under.\n\nErdogan may be making NATO\u2019s life in Turkey unbearable. As the Queen of War is in AIPAC\u2019s pocket, and considering the Clinton Foundation\u2019s by now legendary cozy ties with the House of Saud, the war target would have to be the Saudi/Israeli preferred target, on top of it pro-Damascus and in close touch with both Ankara and Moscow: Iran.\n\nBut how to pull it off? One avenue, already being explored, is to bomb by all means \u2014 and not figuratively \u2014 the Iran nuclear deal. A concerted campaign in US mainstream media is already burying the deal; and even Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei \u2013 as reported in the US \u2013 is on the record saying Washington cannot be trusted; \u2018\u2018They tell us \u2018Let\u2019s talk about regional issues, too.\u2019 But the experience of the nuclear deal suggests this is deadly poison and in no way can the Americans be trusted.\u2019\u2019\n\nSo expect from Team Clinton the proverbial media barrage of dodgy spin, baseless accusations and the occasional, perfectly positioned false flag to lure Tehran intro a trap, like, for instance, in neoliberalcon wishful thinking, Iran reviving its nuclear program. Of course this won\u2019t happen, but a Hellfire barrage of disinformation will be used by the powerful anti-Iran lobby in the US Congress to sort of make it happen, even as an illusion.\n\nAnd all this while Iran, among other development matters, is busy planning a new transportation corridor from the Persian Gulf to the Black Sea, connecting to Armenia, Georgia and Bulgaria, and positioning the nation as a key trade hub connecting the Arab world in the south and west; Central Asia in the north; and Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east, all the way to Europe. Once again, Eurasian integration on the move.\n\nTehran has myriad reasons to be on red alert if the Full Spectrum Dominatrix gets her hands on the nuclear codes (how\u2019s that not scarier than Trump?) She will act as a surefire faithful servant of the Saudi/Israeli alliance. The road map is ready. And neocons and neoliberalcons alike can hardly contain their excitement at seeing in action \u201ca force that can flex across several different mission sets and prevail.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersVanguard/comments/4wvkmb/op_ed_hillary_queen_of_war_the_road_map_ahead_by/\n"

A whois database lookup shows it was registered using a proxy registrar and placed online only 6 days ago. The \"articles\" mostly consist of fake polls showing Trump being way ahead of Clinton nationally, and pieces with titles like \"Do you agree that Obama is guilty of treason?\"\n\nThe worst thing about it is the fact that it is a complete rip off of the real ABC News web site, complete with ABC logos and design. It is so well done, I'm tempted to think it's the work of professional cyber criminals, the same people who construct those convincing looking phishing emails. Whoever is behind it, they're pro Trump and perfectly willing to break the law to try to trick people into thinking they're reading a legitimate news source. I don't like it.\n\nIt appears that the Trump campaign is actually advertising on this fake site that only appeared a few days ago. His campaign ads are all over this site. "

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "Some 2,000 members of the American Postal Workers Union have gathered in Miami where they are officially opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Along with Florida Representative Alan Grayson, they hope to send a message to presidential candidates.\n\nThe 200,000-member strong American Postal Workers Union (APWU) hopes to use its sway to deter Congress from considering the deal during the lame duck period between November\u2019s presidential elections and President Obama\u2019s last day in office in January.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has become a hotly contested issue in the 2016 campaign. While both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have both denounced the proposal, President Barack Obama has yet to abandon the unpopular ship.\n\nThe members of the postal workers union are calling on Hillary Clinton, the APWU\u2019s endorsed candidate, to discourage Congress and the Senate from passing the bill during the lame duck session.\n\nAPWU President Mark Diamondstein explained the workers\u2019 concerns, telling RT \u201cThe people of this country are sick of these trade deals that enrich multinational companies at the expense of workers here and everywhere else\u2026 We are going to demand that this TPP and trade deals like it will be killed.\u201d\n\nTPP would open US borders to products from 12 other countries without trade or tax barriers. However, for members of the APWU, whose annual pay scale starts at roughly $29,000, opening trade to this many nations could be disastrous.\n\nFlorida Congressman Alan Grayson explained the importance of blocking the TPP for average Americans, saying \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now if this goes through, it\u2019s curtains for the middle class of America. We will never, ever, ever be able to recover from this.\u201d\n\nGrayson explained the risks to RT, saying \u201cWhat can happen is any foreign corporation of the TPP can sue any local entity, any state entity \u2013 even the federal government and get a money judgment against us whenever they think we\u2019re taking money out of their pocket if we\u2019re trying to protect our safety, our environment, our health.\u201d\n\nHow does this relate to the US Post Office? In his speech, Grayson stressed \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is your jobs, all of the jobs of the people you love and all the jobs in middle-class America,\u201d adding \u201cit\u2019s a road that leads to nothing but cheap labor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the APWU that opposes the TPP. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations have also publicly spoken out against it, decrying the Obama administration for withholding information from labor unions.\n\nThe Teamsters Union also opposes TPP, citing concerns over whether international competitors could take work away from the industries they are involved in. A press release from the Teamsters Union reads, \u201cOregon\u2019s dairy industry \u2013 which employs about 800 Teamsters at 10 different locations around the state \u2013 could be hit especially hard if the TPP moves forward. It is expected that New Zealand\u2019s state-owned dairy sector would take a significant bite out of local butter and cheese producers.\u201d\n\nOpposition to the TPP has been a mainstay for Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters. Numerous unions have endorsed Hillary Clinton, but some leaders hope that she remembers that she used Sanders\u2019 delegates to get the Democratic nomination.\n\nLarry Cohen, former president of the Communications Workers of America, told RT\u2019s Ed Schultz, \u201cBernie delegates got her elected, that\u2019s why she\u2019s there.\u201d Therefore, he hopes to harness the energy of Bernie Bros to ensure that Clinton does everything she can to block the deal.\n\nCohen also noted that the TPP could open the country up to potentially devastating lawsuits \u2013 similar to the Trans-Canada Partnership that has resulted in \u201cTrans-Canada suing the US for $15 billion over the refusal to allow the Keystone Pipeline.\u201d\n\nhttps://archive.is/rLdFz\n"

Why does that make a difference? I'm genuinely interested. A small country will have a small amount of people that need to be taken care of, but they also have a small work force to support this. A large country like the US will have a ton of people that need help, but a huge work force to support it all."

        "description": "https://archive.is/ZbN6o\n\nWorkers Vanguard No. 1094 26 August 2016\n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, a starkly segregated Rust Belt city on the shore of Lake Michigan, has become the latest stage for horrific street executions of black people by the police, igniting bitter protests by besieged black youth that have drawn national attention. On August 13, a black cop gunned down 23-year-old Sylville Smith after a traffic stop. The police narrative is that Smith, who had a \u201clengthy arrest record,\u201d fled the scene, wielding a stolen handgun. Authorities have refused to release video from the cop body cameras, and no independent video has emerged. As word of the fatal shooting spread, small crowds of protesters quickly took to the streets. A police cruiser, a bank branch and a gas station in the black neighborhood of Sherman Park went up in flames, and rocks and bricks were thrown at police.\n\nAlthough the protests, which flared up over two nights, never grew much larger than 200 people, black Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke\u2014who starred at the Republican convention denouncing Black Lives Matter protesters while lauding racist demagogue Donald Trump\u2014and Republican governor Scott Walker decided to activate the National Guard. But police chief Edward Flynn refused to bring the militia out of the barracks, preferring to show everyone that his cops in riot gear, with their armored vehicles and heavy weapons, were quite adequate for intimidating and repressing demonstrators. A 10 p.m. curfew for youth has been imposed, underlining once more how young people, especially if they are black, are denied the rights of free speech and free assembly that the population is supposed to have.\n\nAt a midnight press conference convened by Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, to try to calm the city on the first night of protest, black alderman Khalif Rainey condemned Milwaukee as \u201cthe worst place to live for African-Americans in the entire country.\u201d Rainey pointed to the hideous conditions of daily life for black people in Milwaukee for having spurred the protests, as much as the killing of Smith did. Ludicrously, after the second night of disturbances police chief Flynn announced that outsiders (supposed \u201ccommunists\u201d) from Chicago, all of 90 miles away, were the instigators, stirring up the supposedly otherwise contented local residents. This redbaiting recalls the denunciation of \u201coutside agitators\u201d during the civil rights movement.\n\nThe truth is that no more was required to spark protest than one more instance of a wanton cop slaughter of a black man added to the pervasive poverty and unremitting racist oppression. In June, a suburban Milwaukee cop shot dead 25-year-old Jay Anderson while he sat in his car in a park because he allegedly had a weapon in view. In 2015, 19-year-old Tony Robinson, a biracial high school graduate about to start college in Milwaukee, was shot five times and killed by a cop in the liberal university bastion of Madison because he was behaving \u201cerratically.\u201d Robinson had merely eaten hallucinogenic mushrooms. In 2014, protesters hit the streets to insist that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d after Milwaukee cops killed Dontre Hamilton, an unarmed 31-year-old man with a history of mental health problems.\n\nIn Milwaukee, as much or more than anywhere else in the country, every statistic says that the capitalist rulers don\u2019t give a damn about black lives. Milwaukee is the nation\u2019s second poorest major city, and Wisconsin has the highest black unemployment rate in the country. Jobs are concentrated in the lily-white suburbs, made inaccessible to black people by a long-established public policy of funding freeways and starving public transportation. Forty percent of black Milwaukeeans live below the poverty line, barely able to eat, much less pay for a car; over 30 percent live in \u201cextreme poverty.\u201d In the decrepit and highly segregated public schools, only 17 percent of eighth graders are proficient in math; only 15 percent in reading. Fully 43 percent of black students were suspended during the 2011-12 school year. Black men in Milwaukee are incarcerated at the highest rate in the nation\u2014in a nation where locking up young black men is an industry and a defining feature of life.\n\nThe economy of this country was founded on the bedrock of black slavery; today, black oppression remains of inestimable value to the ruling class to divide and weaken the working masses. The cops are the enforcers for the capitalist profit system. They exist for one reason: to ensure that the brutal exploitation of labor and the forcible segregation of the mass of the black population at the bottom of society continue, unchallenged. It is this system alone that they \u201cprotect and serve.\u201d\n\nThis was true in 1958 when Milwaukee cops pulled over 22-year-old Daniel Bell in a traffic stop eerily like the one involving Sylville Smith. After gunning down Bell, the cop who killed him shrugged it off: \u201cHe\u2019s just a damn n----r kid anyhow.\u201d The case marked the beginning of the civil rights movement in Wisconsin. In the South, that period of accelerating protest brought an end to formal Jim Crow segregation. But such official segregation laws were never a prerequisite for the crumbling housing, impoverished schools and cop attacks that blacks had to endure in the Northern cities, and still endure today.\n\nIt is a good thing that the shooting down of black youth by the cops continues to be met with outrage and defiance. But the activists of today need to be won to the understanding that only the overthrow of the capitalist system itself by the revolutionary action of the working class leading all of the oppressed can put an end to the racist violence of this state and its hired guns. It is because of the extreme bankruptcy of the existing leadership of the working class that such a perspective seems remote and far-fetched. The bureaucrats at the head of the trade unions today are open defenders of the profits of American industry. Refusing to defend their own members against multi-tier contracts, health care cutbacks, non-union subcontractors and other attacks on living standards, still less do they fight against the broader social oppression of minorities and immigrants. We communists are committed to the fight within the unions for a new, class-struggle leadership.\n\nA leadership of labor that does not take up the fight for the most oppressed layers of the working people is hamstrung in advance. Wisconsin is an appropriate example of leadership in the negative. The state is a former labor bastion whose unions are now hemorrhaging members, after Governor Walker stripped public-sector unions of the right to bargain for their members and pushed through a \u201cright to work\u201d law. In 2011, a huge demonstration of unionists against the law at the state Capitol was organized by the AFL-CIO as a carnival with Democratic Party politicians on the podium. The labor tops derailed any possibility of strike action, instead urging a recall campaign against Walker and his cronies and, of course, the election of more Democrats. Now Walker himself, still in the governor\u2019s mansion, in his own way underscores the link between labor and blacks (he evidently hates both) as he threatens Milwaukee\u2019s black community with the National Guard coming in to insult and provoke people some more, and perhaps worse.\n\nNationally, a labor movement truly worthy of the name would mobilize its forces in demonstrations against cop terror, ensuring that at least the black youth would not stand alone. But the tremendous potential power of the working class cannot be brought to bear unless the workers are mobilized independently of all the political representatives of the capitalist class\u2014Republicans, Democrats, Greens. In the absence of a perspective looking to the working class, the demands of today\u2019s anti-racist militants, despite good intentions, can be reduced to the idea that some other part of the capitalist government needs to restrain the cops, retrain them, investigate them, indict them, take away their excessive weapons, etc.\n\nTo weld the righteous anger of the ghetto together with the power of the working class in a fight to smash capitalism demands the leadership of a revolutionary party. Only on the basis of the active fight for black liberation can the workers of all races and nationalities be united in the fight against their common oppressor to make a socialist revolution in this country.\n\nhttp://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1094/milwaukee.html\n"

        "description": "https://archive.is/Z16kS\n\nWorkers Vanguard No. 1095 9 September 2016\n\nImprisoned for Spying for Cuba\n\nFree Ana Bel\u00e9n Montes!\n\nFor almost 15 years, Ana Bel\u00e9n Montes has languished in a U.S. prison for her active solidarity with the Cuban Revolution. Having been the Pentagon\u2019s number one expert on Cuba since the mid \u201980s, Montes pleaded guilty in 2002 to \u201cconspiracy to commit espionage\u201d for the Cuban government. Alleged to have turned over reams of American military and intelligence secrets to the Cuban authorities, including the identities of Washington\u2019s undercover spies, Montes was deemed \u201cone of the most damaging spies\u201d by the U.S. imperialist rulers and gone after with a vengeance. Montes never benefited one penny for passing on classified information. She expressed her motivation during a 2015 interview: \u201cWhat matters to me is that the Cuban Revolution exists.\u201d It is in the interests of the working class and the oppressed in the U.S. and around the world to demand: Freedom now for Ana Bel\u00e9n Montes!\n\nBorn in 1957 to Puerto Rican parents on a U.S. military base in West Germany, Montes was raised and educated in the U.S. During her graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in the 1980s, Montes became increasingly repulsed by the bloody anti-communist policies of the U.S. in Latin America. Initially landing a job as a clerk typist at the Department of Justice, Montes rose through the ranks to become a senior analyst at the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence arm, the Defense Intelligence Agency, specializing in Latin American and Cuban affairs.\n\nTwo weeks after the September 11 attacks in 2001, the FBI arrested Montes and charged her with espionage. She was sentenced to 25 years behind bars. At her sentencing, Montes called U.S. policy towards Cuba \u201ccruel and unfair,\u201d stating: \u201cI felt morally obligated to help the island defend itself from our efforts to impose our values and our political system on it.\u201d\n\nFor decades, U.S. imperialism has waged a war against the deformed workers state of Cuba, which emerged with the overthrow of capitalist rule in 1960-61. Among the imperialists\u2019 bloody adventures: the 1961 Playa Gir\u00f3n (Bay of Pigs) invasion; the 1976 bombing of a fully loaded Cubana airliner that killed 73 people (Luis Posada Carriles, the terrorist responsible for that atrocity is still living in Miami); and numerous assassination attempts on Fidel Castro. The U.S. notoriously provides support and money to counterrevolutionaries on the island and, while trade and other commercial relations have increased, maintains its embargo intended to deprive the population of basic goods.\n\nDespite the political rule of a bureaucratic nationalist caste under the Castros (Fidel and now Ra\u00fal), the enormous gains for working people made possible by Cuba\u2019s collectivized economy\u2014including the renowned health care and educational systems\u2014exist to this day. Yet such gains remain in the crosshairs of the imperialists as they seek to reconquer Cuba for capitalist exploitation.\n\nIn 2015, as part of restoring diplomatic ties, President Obama and President Castro negotiated a spy swap. Obama released the remaining members of the Cuban Five\u2014courageous men who attempted to prevent terrorist acts against Cuba by infiltrating and monitoring counterrevolutionary exile groups in Florida\u2014and Ra\u00fal Castro released two American spies, including Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a former CIA operative. Trujillo had provided information leading to the conviction of the Cuban Five and Montes as well as former State Department official Walter Kendall Myers who, along with his wife Gwendolyn, was sentenced to prison for transmitting defense information to Cuba in 2010. (See \u201cFree Walter and Gwendolyn Myers! Free the Cuban Five!\u201d WV No. 963, 27 August 2010.)\n\nMontes is now incarcerated at the Texas Federal Medical Center (FMC) at Carswell Prison. Known as \u201cthe hospital of horrors,\u201d the FMC is notorious for violence and rape inflicted on female inmates. Isolated from all the other prisoners in the mental ward, Montes is barred from receiving phone calls and her correspondence is severely restricted. Montes stated, \u201cI live in conditions of extreme psychological pressure. I don\u2019t even have the most minimal contact with the world, except for the one I imagine ideally.\u201d But she refuses to be broken: \u201cI will resist until the end even if it\u2019s difficult.\u201d\n\nOur defense of heroic individuals like Montes and Walter and Gwendolyn Myers is part of our defense of the Cuban Revolution. Isolated and impoverished, the Cuban deformed workers state cannot forever resist the strong economic and military pressures exerted by the U.S. and the imperialist world market. Genuine defense of the Cuban Revolution against imperialism demands a revolutionary internationalist perspective, with its survival ultimately dependent on socialist revolution internationally, especially in the U.S. Such a perspective must be tied to the fight for a proletarian political revolution to oust the Castroite bureaucracy, which excludes the working class from political power and promotes the fallacy of building \u201csocialism\u201d in a single country.\n\nhttp://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1095/ana_belen_montes.html\n"

        "description": "https://archive.is/FF4BM\n\nWorkers Vanguard No. 1096 23 September 2016\n\nHunger Strike Ends\n\nFree Chelsea Manning!\n\nJust two months after being driven to a suicide attempt, imprisoned transgender whistle-blower Chelsea Manning went on hunger strike to protest ongoing abuse and denial of health care in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Manning\u2014who was sentenced in 2013 for disclosing military and state secrets to WikiLeaks\u2014refused all food and beverage and demanded \u201cminimum standards of dignity, respect, and humanity,\u201d including the ability to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Her drastic plea ended after five days on September 13 when the army relented and agreed to allow her to proceed with the surgery.\n\nManning\u2019s hunger strike was emblematic of the dire anguish she has had to endure during her six-year battle with military jailers. Her appeals for help have been, in her words, \u201cignored, delayed, mocked.\u201d While the former military analyst was granted an official name change in 2014 (from Bradley) and hormone therapy in 2015, she has been in a relentless legal battle to receive the recommended medical treatment for gender transitioning. Being forced to maintain short hair and being held in an all male unit\u2014which exposes her to greater risk of anti-trans harassment and assault\u2014are examples of what Manning refers to as \u201chigh tech bullying\u201d on the part of prison and military officials.\n\nGrotesquely, Manning is still facing charges for surviving her suicide attempt in July, after which she was threatened with the torture of indefinite solitary confinement. She could also be hit with administrative charges related to her suicide attempt. As Chase Strangio, one of her lawyers, remarked: \u201cShe\u2019s essentially being punished by the government for trying to die, after so many times being punished for trying to live.\u201d\n\nManning may become the first U.S. transgender inmate to undergo gender reassignment surgery. But the struggle continues for the freedom of this courageous individual facing a vindictive 35-year sentence for espionage. Manning, alongside whistle-blowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, carried out a heroic service by exposing a degree of the secrecy and crimes of U.S. imperialism. As an appeal to pardon Snowden gains publicity with the release of Oliver Stone\u2019s new biopic, Manning\u2019s case merits a widespread, coordinated campaign for her release. Free Chelsea Manning now! Hands off Julian Assange and Edward Snowden!\n\nIn an interview last month with Amnesty International, Manning stated: \u201cA government can arrest you. It can imprison you. It can put out information about you that won\u2019t get questioned by the public\u2014everyone will just assume that what they are saying is true. Sometimes, a government can even kill you\u2014with or without the benefit of a trial.... It is very terrifying to face the government alone.\u201d Manning helped open the eyes of many to the systematic violence and lies of America\u2019s rulers. Marxists seek to impart the understanding that only when the system of capitalism is destroyed through workers revolution internationally will the savagery and depravity that today plague humanity be ended.\n\nhttp://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1096/chelsea_manning.html\n"

        "description": "I have come to the conclusion that the biggest problem our nation faces isn't terrorism, immigration, the economy, or any of the other topics that will be discussed by any elected official. The Republican and Democratic parties are the biggest problems we face. Neither party cares about we the people. They only care about re-election and they know that the only way to be re-elected is to raise ridiculous sums of money from corporate sponsors. Corporate greed was once controlled by the US Government. Now it feeds it. (See Teddy Roosevelt)\nFor the first time in my life I am going to vote for a 3rd party candidate for a federal office, the President. I would be too ashamed to vote for either of the the two major party candidates. If you are not ashamed of your party's candidate, you are not paying attention or are intentionally blinding yourself to the facts.\nOnly by empowering other parties will we have a chance to change things. I have no hope that the person I vote for will win. But I can no longer put up with business as usual.\nThere are a few things that government has the proven ability to do well. In the US, they stopped doing those things. Our infrastructure is collapsing around us. There are third world countries that have better internet service than we do. This is insane. We invented the damn thing. We pay the highest prices in the world for pharmaceuticals even though a large portion of these drugs are developed and produced in the US. The safety checks on our food products is laughable compared to other nations. Many, many chemicals used in many, many products in the US are outlawed in other countries because they are known to bad for our health.\nInstead, our government continually decides to stick its nose in things that should be left to the state/local government or the individual.\nAnd the things that we should be most fearful of the Government doing too much, ie: policing, invading our personal liberties, surreptitiously affecting our free press and our elections, etc., are done unabatedly and with seemingly no concern by most of the electorate.\nRegardless who is elected, Trump or Clinton, we will get more of the same: corporate greed and legalized corruption. Please consider a protest vote for a third party candidate.\n\n"

My primary motivation to vote is fulfilling what feels like a civic duty, rather than attempting to influence what already seems like will be a landslide victory for Clinton, both in the popular and electoral college vote. Is it still worth it to participate in this election, given these circumstances? "

The North American Colonies struck for independence and revolted, due to lack of representation and ability to influence decisions made by the English crown and parliament.\n\n2. The original framing of the second amendment, is to provide for the ability for the populace to revolt against an oppressive government, forming liberty militias.\n\n3. The primary voting bloc behind Donald Trump supports and actively exercises their second amendment rights.\n\n4. Donald Trump is actively declaring to them that the Presidential elections are rigged, and therefore the people are not being duly represented.\n\nFrom all of this, given historical precedents, doesn't this pretty much mean that if he loses, he's going to be cementing the path for someone to declare independence from the United States, with the weaponry and precedent to do so?\ufeff  \n\nI say someone, because despite his statements, its not in Donald Trump's best business interests to start a revolution, so I doubt he'll continue leading it past the election.\n\nIs this likely, or are Americans actually smarter than that?"

Methods:**\n\n* **Register online:** This is available for 31 states plus DC. [List here.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx#Table%20of%20states%20w/ovr)\n* **Mail-in:** If your state does not yet offer online registration, use the national mail in form [here](http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/Documents/Federal%20Voter%20Registration_1209_en8242012.pdf):\n\n* **In-Person:** You can also register in person with your [state or local election office](https://www.usa.gov/election-office). \n\n**NOTE**: [15 states](http://www.mytimetovote.com/election-day-registration.html) let you register in person on Election Day, but that's not recommended because of extended wait times, unpredictable eligibility requirements, and voter suppression tactics.\n\n---\n**HELP A BROTHER OUT!**\n\nMake sure your state's subreddit has a *\"Where to Vote\"* post on the front page!

The combination of a huge industrial base (and its accompanying unions) and the worst schools in probably the whole developed world (and accompanying municipal corruption) have created a Democratic party stronghold without peer.  I had the privilege this summer of accidentally attending a Clinton rally, billed as a radio station cookout, consisting solely of racial grandstanding.  You get the idea.\n\n\nMy roommate grew up very poor in the heart of the city, but he's quite smart (we get along) and got to enjoy seven years of Ivy league college education.  He does not uncritically accept things, and he is a Christian, and knowledgeable about civics and trade and morality, so he finds himself voting for conservative candidates regularly.\n\n\nSo this fine man went to vote.\n\n\nHis polling location did not have the usual privacy safeguards, but three single-file lines and ballots on open clipboards.\n\n\nThis is unusual, and probably improper.\n\n\nMy roommate also has some health conditions, an active family life, and gets up at 5 for work, so he had no interest in causing trouble for its own sake.  Life is too short, and it is not a constructive errand.\n\n\nSo it was not without chagrin that he heard a man behind him in line, seeing his ballot, begin to call \"Oh \\#\\#\\#\\# no!  This [citizen] [is] about to vote for Trump!\"  This news was met with wide and vocal disapproval, and he was accosted on all sides concerning his vote.\n\n\nThis was a bother, but not as bad as when his friend got dragged out and beaten for not voting for Obama.  So he went forward and handed in his ballot.  The volunteer smiled and thanked him for voting.\n\n\nAnd didn't place his ballot in the counter.  She just left it on the table.  He inquired why this was, as the lady immediately in front of him had her ballot placed into the counter at once.  The volunteer explained that the machine wasn't working (though apparently was just a moment before.)  He continued his insistence (and pointed out the previous voter) to which she became increasingly hostile.\n\n\nThe humor was growing thin.  He went back to check-in and asked for the manager.  After an explanation, the manager did apologize but repeatedly insisted that their volunteers had only sparse training (and other bald-faced horsefeathers but did eventually process his ballot.)\n\n\nWe have been on the phone and internet portals to report the incident to relevant ethics and propriety hotlines.  What we're learning is that, statistically, voter intimidation and fraud concentrates in very strong majority locales.\n\n\nThat is to say, where there's no point to it anyway.\n\n\nMuch like financial impropriety, cheaters just usually aren't very smart."

We are so divided, we only understand our political opposites as caricatures, and we mocked and vilified them. Today proves more then ever that we have no choice but to live in these circumstances for four years. We must reduce the vitriol.\nIf anyone else is as passionate about this as I am, I made a new sub: /r/MorePerfectUnion\n\nThe idea is to have open dialogues between people of completely different circumstances so we can understand our fellow citizens better. The promise of the Internet to connect us like never before has not only failed insurmountably, but it has actually walled people off from other points of view and perspectives. I really hope this can be one small step in trying to return this country to some state of normalcy.\n\nPlease PM me if you are interested. The format, content, and rules are all TBD right now. I'd love to have a politically diverse team who truly cares about this project put together.\n\nPlease PM if interested."

        "description": "Over the past 8 months or so we have heard a line repeated over and over by the Clinton campaign which has been echoed in the media in order to bring about a mass hysteria: Donald Trump is an unhinged maniac with dark intentions that should never have access to the nuclear codes.\n\nSo let's approach this logically and point out some reasons why he would never start a nuclear conflict. \n\n**1. He loves his children**\n\nSay what you will about Donald Trump but one thing that is difficult to deny is that he loves his children. Throughout the election cycle and for years prior he has surrounded himself with his children and now his grandchildren. Starting a nuclear war would certainly put his family at risk which is something he would never do.\n\n**2. He has spent years building a real estate empire**\n\nDonald's real estate is the source of his power, his personal prestige and self image. Not only are his buildings clear indications of his status, the monies generated from his buildings is the oil that fuels his empire. We can imagine that New York and Washington D.C. would be among the first targets in a nuclear war and his buildings would be most certainly demolished.\n\n**3. A chance at reconciliation with Russia**\n\nHillary's campaign has repeatedly attempted to associate Donald Trump with Russia despite the fact that he has no proven connections to Putin or the Kremlin. Recently Vladimir Putin has signaled that he would like to reconcile with the United States which by any rational measure should immediately bring down the chances of a nuclear conflict, at least for the short term.\n\n**4. A nuclear war does not align with his stated ambitions**\n\nDonald Trump's rallying cry has been to \"Make America great again\" which in this context means to rebuild the United States infrastructure, bring jobs back to the country and make the nation wealthy and prosperous. If his stated goal had been to \"make our enemies cower\" the prospect of war would certainly be high, however his stated goals are quite the opposite.\n\n**5. Trump is not a warmonger**\n\nBesides a fleeting confirmation that he would support the war on Iraq during a radio interview, Trump has been largely anti-war in many of his pronouncements. One of his main reasons has been the fact that inevitably soldiers are tragically killed, wounded and maimed in war.. He is fully aware that a full scale conflict would cause more soldiers to be wounded he sees as tragic and futile."

        "description": "So I saw this article posted somewhere in reddit a few weeks ago, and now I could really use it for an essay I'm writing and trying to find the thing but I can't so I was wondering if anyone had a link.\n\nIt was the % confidence that registered members of the Democrats and GOP had in their leaders throughout the year when they were both in and out of government and majorities, This particular set of polls (though if you find one that conflicts with the one I'm lookign for I would still 100% appricate you linking it) showed that when in the White House the Democrats historically had lower confidence in their leader than Republicans, and the Democrats seemed to have greater confidance in their leaders when they were the opposition.\n\nIf anyone has the thing I'm talking about I would really appreciate it as I've looked online a lot and can't find anything even similar with all the data collated in one place for this essay\n\nSo as always lads, thanks for any help you can offer, or if you can suggest of another sub reddit where I may have a better chance if of finding it if I ask there."

        "description": "For me, as an outsider looking in, it seems like America is a country very similar to my own in the UK. We're so afraid of offending people and their beliefs that we've been turned into a bunch of sheep who just baaaah \"that's acceptable\", \"your beliefs are correct because that is your right\" and other bullshit. \n\nWhat Trump has done, at least for me, is show people that it's alright to disagree with a particular group of people or a particular religion. That doesn't make you a racist. That makes you nothing more than a person with an opinion. We all have prejudices and that's just human nature. \n\nMyself, I'm not religious at all, I don't think any religion has got it spot on. I don't reject the idea of a \"higher being\" or whatever you choose to call it, him or her but I lean towards that side because that's where the overwhelming data is. \n\nDo I think Trump is racist because he wants to get Islam out of America? No. Are all Muslims potential terrorists? No, far from it. But even my Muslim friends admit Islam is the most likely religion to develop a person into someone with extremist views. You can go into the evidence that Muslim countries tend to be the poorer and more violent nations but I don't think you have to. If a set of principles are the most likely set to create potentially violent people it only makes sense to try and remove those principles. Especially when you are the leader of the most powerful could try in the world. \n\nPut simply Islam does not mix well with the Western world. And that's completely OK. But what's not OK is when the Western world are accused of being racist when they say this. One poll shows 2 out of 3 British Muslims would not report a terror attack plot to police. How can anyone expect a country like the British people to accept Islam as a peaceful religion when their own fellow citizens would not help to protect them in their home. \n\nThere's a blurry line where political correctness and racism meet but saying you dislike a religion is not crossing that line. Trump has made it OK if you're not politically correct in all of your views. It's not natural to be and it doesn't create a healthy environment for a prosperous country either. "

        "description": "\nWatching the campaign season unfold was one of seeming joy for Clinton fans, and just keeping fingers crossed in the Trump camp. All the polls, with the possible exception of the LA Times, were predicting a landslide in Clinton\u2019s favor. This seemed in stark contrast to the rallies the 2 candidates held \u2013 Trump drew thousands, and Clinton hundreds. Yard signs favored Trump it seemed as well \u2013 but those polls were solidly for her.\n\nBill Mitchell, a conservative pundit, remained steadfastly critical of the polls the entire election cycle. He is a poll junkie. He would dissect them and identify that the poll was D+7, or D+3, or D+10 even\u2026 Democrats were being oversampled he argued. Obama, a popular and charismatic figure, won with an estimated D+1 result. Mitchell had argued that no poll should grant the Democrats MORE than that \u2013 so D+1 at best, or perhaps even R+1 to be more accurate given the lack of Clinton charisma. Mitchell felt all along that Trump would win because if you skewed the data in the proper sampling direction, then Trump was ahead. In the end, he was proven very correct, and the professional pollsters all had egg on their collective faces.\n\nBut the problem with these polls duping the public is more pernicious that just false hope. The entire MSM built its theme around a coronation for Clinton with the polls as the evidence. The polls were a bedrock for building stories that were false narratives of Trump floundering and Clinton winning with ease. The Democratic and Liberal voters ate up the MSM and incorporated the message into their souls. They looked past Clinton\u2019s flaws, which the MSM conveniently minimized, and planned for their future 1st female POTUS.\n\nWhen November 8th rolled around, and into the wee hours of the 9th, the utter shock devastated these voters. Their \u201chorse\u201d was a sure thing; this could not be happening. Cognitive dissonance set in \u2013 the Clinton voters were promised a win by reams of polls and the articles they had spawned. Finger pointing began and the FBI was blamed, the Russians, fake news, racist whites, and misogynistic women. The Clinton campaign and scandals are rarely brought up as a cause for defeat. The polls, which were as fake as \u201cfake news\u201d ever gets, somehow got it terribly wrong but were not as criticized as they deserved to be.\n\nI would contend that the scientific pollsters knowingly mis-sampled for their polls, providing a base upon which deifying Clinton articles, and Democratic expectations were built. Why did they do this is the question. I would guess that someone oversampled D and got good press coverage, so others followed suit thinking it 1) must be valid, and 2) brought more revenue. The pollsters all piled on to defraud the country creating fake news.\n\nThe devastating loss to the Democratic supporters has led to severe division within the USA. Some sought to throw out the vote based upon Russian hackers, and some sought to sway electors from casting votes for the Republican winner. Protests continue to divide our populous. The Democratic voters shattered expectations have left them in collective denial and anger, not yet arriving at bargaining, and far from acceptance.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the pollsters that sampled incorrectly are to be severely faulted for their actions. Their false bedrock acted as a springboard for false articles and fed false expectations. Our nation\u2019s pain rests on the shoulders of morally bankrupt pollsters.\n"

        "description": "The last three presidential elections have seen candidates advocating \"change,\" with the latest president-elect winning almost solely on the idea that he's an \"outsider\" and thus immune to the corruption that plagues American politics.  I'll skip commenting on specific candidates for the sake of civil and constructive discussion.\n\nSo, if we want to make meaningful change in the political happenings of this country, what steps do we really need to take?  In my opinion, there are three major changes that need to happen before we see any meaningful change.\n\n1. Campaign finance needs a serious overhaul.  Specifically, if an individual cannot vote for a candidate, they should not be able to give money to that candidate.  I find it incredibly ironic that we flip our shit (rightfully) at the notion that Russia is influencing our elections, but we find it business as usual when the Koch brothers fund candidates in a dozen states.  It's the exact same thing to me, except the scale is reduced from the national to the state level.  If you can't vote for a candidate, you have no business influencing their election.  This would also contradict citizens united, as non-citizen entities cannot cast a vote.  I do believe that lobbyists are a necessary institution, but their ability to contribute campaign finances gives them a level of power disproportionate to the general populace and shifts the balance of power heavily in their favor.\n\n2. Political parties need to be outright banned.  This one might sound a bit radical, but I honestly believe that political party allegiance is the second most detrimental aspect of our political system.  For one, it dumbs down elections to a red vs. blue decision where many people don't even bother to vet their candidates.  They simply vote on party lines.  Moreover, once elected, these senators, representatives, and even presidents are compelled to adhere to party politics, regardless of the platform for which they were elected by their constituents.  The mere existence of the Whip is anti-democratic.  A binary party system, especially, creates a disincentive for compromise and encourages obstructionist behavior.\n\n3. The Electoral College needs to die.  This is a system that at best was instituted as a compromise to get the smaller states to ratify the constitution with an assurance that they wouldn't have a diminished voice.  At worst it was a system of keeping the control of the vote in the hands of the privileged white.  In modern politics it serves no purpose and in its effect favors rural white voters while diminishing the voting power of urban and minority voters.  The Senate exists to ensure that less populace states aren't ignored, but that principle has no business in the election of our president.\n\nNow, I'm just an ordinary citizen with little background in these things, so I imagine my ideas have some serious flaws, either in core concept or at least in practicality.  I have no idea how we get from where we are now to any of these three points, given how entrenched we are in the current system.  What I'd like is to open a dialogue.  Rather than another post where we all complain about the problems and the future under the coming administration, I'd like to foster discussion on how we can achieve real change in our political system.  What should that change look like, and just as importantly, how do we get there?\n\nTear me apart.  Tell me why I'm stupid, naive, that I'm dreaming through a pipe.  But if you do - what would you do differently?  What does real change look like to you, and how would you get there?  If you like my ideas, how can we proactively work toward them as ordinary citizens, aside from \"write your representative\" or \"vote for x candidate?\""

        "description": "Gun control is a touchy subject in the USA, but I'll just be as straight forward as possible. \n\nLook, I'm starting to get bored sick of this bullshit \"Banning guns won't do anything\" argument. It's yes and no. No, if you ban guns today it won't fix much. People with guns will still keep it, try to resist, etc. Yes, if you look long term, once all those guns are turned in and all those people die off, gun violence will go down.\n\nWhere is my proof of this? I used to live in Japan. Look at Japan. There is next to zero gun crimes in there. Even the infamous Yakuza have issues getting guns. They banned guns a long time ago before it could ever become a problem. \n\nWhere is my proof that it won't fix it right away? Australia and the UK. They were too late, 1996 to be specific. It has not been enough time for the gun bans to really do anything. \n\nBanning guns is a LONG TERM thing if guns were once totally legal. No ones gonna turn their beloved guns in right away, but I'm starting to hate the \"banning guns does nothing\" argument because I came from a country where guns are banned and gun crimes are non-existent. Japan banned guns in 1971. That means they've had it banned WAY before UK or Australia. The effect of the ban has had more time to put in its influence.\n\nWhere do I stand on this? In the middle. Guns are fine, just add a bit more regulation. I think guns are just a part of the USA we all have to learn to control, plus it's the second amendment; people will never get over that. People who want to own guns should be mentally evaluated and participate in general gun safety classes. It shouldn't be like any old psychopath can walk into Wal-Mart and buy an automatic rifle off the wall. \n\nPS\nBeing afraid of guns isn't necessarily being \"afraid of an inanimate object\" as a lot of people say. The gun adds danger to a person. The gun is not bad, the person is, but if the person didn't have a gun... Would he be as dangerous? No."

The only way someone could make such a dramatic change to the state of a country is through some type of dictatorship, which I'm completely against. I think that some people expect our country to magically get itself out of debt with the help of a \"good\" president, but I just don't think it's possible in a 4-8 year span to pay back trillions of dollars. Wartime economics isn't as big of an advantage for us as it was in World War II and no longer has the ability to launch us from financial hell into economic giants. \nTLDR: I feel people use a lot of recency bias with politics and each president will be considered the \"worst\" by a large chunk of US citizens."

If there's nothing in the action that states that guns will be taken away, then why are all the candidates insisting that Americans will have their rights taken away with this bill? I don't see it as a hindrance to the second amendment. \n\nCan someone explain this objectively? "

Since so much has happened and I know very little about each candidates views and ideas, I'm not sure where to start.\n\nI'm always hearing that too often during the debates the candidates will make claims that are completely untrue and the major news stations are also biased in one fashion or another.  I just want to read or watch some unbiased true facts about major issues and candidate's plans.\n\nThis is probably extremely too broad of a question, but maybe someone has some good videos or something to help me out.  Thanks!"

I am posting this for discussion, and will not doggedly stick to my own views, if a reasonable argument can be made.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**One disturbing realization struck me in the military.**  There was a point that I had to stop watching war movies, because I realized that most of the glamour in war comes from the risk of death.  Being at risk did not bother me much.  Realizing that a lot of military appreciation was merely interest in mortality DID bother me.  The idea that the military's must watched videos are tear-jerkers and tributes to helicopter bombings is disgusting, to me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMore people than I care to think about visualize war as some sort of reality tv show, where people fight with other people and some die.  It's almost as if being in the military was a way to prove to the self and others that my willingness to fight to the death should never be questioned. What a simple and ridiculous thing to be proud of, or ability to fight and claw our way into oblivion without a second thought for compromise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince when did anyone get the right to think they've learned everything they need to learn, except for radical Christians and radical Muslims and radical mid-twenties, uneducated military boys....  Nations of people cannot be plowed under for another \"crop\" to grow in its place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUgh, this topic has me HOT right now.  Destruction should never be an option, unless we are directly threatened, and none of the soccer moms and dads waiting at home, or friends of troops, or troops themselves have the right to call for hatefully swift, inadequate justice for foreign nations they learned about in a pamphlet, PowerPoint, or news program told you between Papa John's commercials."

        "description": "Paying USA taxes is entirely voluntary -- I have chosen not to pay them, and that is working out fine. I have chosen to pay taxes somewhere else where I think I better bargain.\n\nPaying taxes in the USA is a freely entered contract, where you get the benefits of USA citizenship, and you pay a yearly membership free. Many in the third world would pay much for this.\n\nThere is no slavery -- you work to pay the membership fee for a housing association that you have freely chosen to be a member of.\n\nJust as working for Wal*Mart: you think that their wages are too low and health-care and pension deductions too high? Then find a better paying job, working at Wal*mart is a free choice, and you can quite anytime you want. There is a long queue outside of people eager to take your job.\n\nYou think that the USA \"housing association\" is not offering good value for its membership fee? Nobody is forcing you to be a member, you can always quit it, sell your flat/house there and buy one in another \"housing association\".\n\nTAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.\n\nIt's important to realise that when government invests it will always generate the same amount of taxation for any positive tax rate. Pound for Pound. Each and every time.\n\nSo why is there a government deficit you are no doubt screaming. Well that's because you've missed the other bit of taxation.\n\nTaxation is about reducing spending. That is its primary purpose, in aggregate, - to stop the system overspending its capacity.\n\nOnce you understand that, then you quickly realise that people actually tax themselves. It's often called saving. That reduces the amount of spending an individual does - which is the primary purpose of taxation. So we can call saving - specifically saving in excess of investment - Voluntary Taxation.\n\nAnd that gives the simple equation:\nVoluntary Taxation + Compulsory Taxation = Government Investment\nwhich simplifies to:\nTaxation = Government Investment\nfor those with a correct understanding of what taxation actually is.\n\nTherefore to increase the total amount of Taxation, you just push up Government Investment - once you've assured yourself that there is real space in the economy to take the extra investment. If there isn't enough Voluntary Taxation, then government can up the Compulsory Taxation or encourage more Voluntary Taxation to make space - should it so wish.\n\nThe distribution argument is completely separate from this. It is about who gets to do Voluntary Taxation and who gets to do Compulsory Taxation, and whether that distribution is considered fair by the population. The government investment is already done at that point and the total amount cannot be affected by the distribution algorithm. It's just arguing about which end of the water ballon should be the highest.\n\nYes it's an important debate, but it has nothing to do with whether we have public services or not.\n\nWe will get nowhere until we get it across to people that governments are about deploying people and stuff to achieve a vision that all of us have signed up to via the democratic process. And by doing that we have given our government sovereign authority to bring it about.\n\nClearly we use a monetary economy, not a barter one. Just like we use AC electricity not DC. Therefore using ideas that only apply to DC systems on an AC system is going to be a SHOCKING mistake (sorry).\n\nWe clearly need a generation system (the government sector) that has to circulate more money around the system (KVA) than would otherwise be the case to energise our advanced mechanised production system and ensure that it can deliver full output. If it doesn't then the system just generates less output.\n\nThe government spending/taxation cycle is the Reactive Power in the economy. With an advanced productive economy that has a Power Factor less than 1 (doesn't need all the labour to produce all the output), it has to be there to ensure that all the real work that could be done gets done.\n\nTrying to get rid of Reactive Power is a fools errand. As any Electrical Engineer will tell you, the only way to get rid of reactive power is to get rid of the advanced economy. Why would we want to do that?\n\nLearn to love Economic Reactive Power. It's what allows the most Real Work to get done."

        "description": "The presidential primaries are soon and I was looking for advice on who to vote for. I am very liberal and naturally want to vote for Bernie Sanders. What concerns me though is the fact that statistically it is entirely probable that someone like Trump, Cruz or Carson could be elected as the GOP candidate. Would it make any sense at all to actually register as a republican for the primaries and vote for someone who is polling lower in order to heighten the chances of a more moderate GOP candidate begin selected? I am truly afraid of how high some of the GOP candidates are polling and was wondering if there is any sense in actually voting republican to completely avoid having an individual such as Trump, Cruz or Carson from being elected as president?"

And he needs to win 3 out of the first 4 primaries/caucuses to start closing the gap nationally.\n\nWhat do you think though? Can pushing in Iowa followed by a big win in NH give his campaign the traction it needs?"

So his opponents have succeeded for a long time because they could do so - but eventually have had to face the light of day (at great cost obviously to many) - but in the end the public has little choice left but to agree with Sanders (statistically speaking of course).\n\nUnlike other politicians who aim to modify themselves to the electorate - this would be an example of an electorate coming around to where a candidate was standing.\n\nJust an view.\n"

        "description": "'My mole in the White House tells me Obama will nominate 46-year-old Judge Sri Srinivasan, an Indian-American jurist who Obama nominated in 2013 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit -- and the Senate confirmed unanimously. Having confirmed him unanimously just three years ago, it would be difficult (but hardly impossible) for Republicans to oppose him now. (Twelve former Solicitors General, including Republican notables as Paul Clement and Kenneth Starr had endorsed his confirmation. Moreover, the D.C. Circuit has long been a Supreme Court farm team \u2013 Scalia himself, along with John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were judges there before ascending to the Supreme Court.)\n\nBut is Srinivasan progressive? He had been Obama\u2019s principal Deputy Solicitor General before the nomination, arguing Supreme Court cases in support of affirmative action and against Indiana\u2019s restrictive voter ID law, for example. But this record doesn\u2019t prove much. (Having once worked as an assistant Solicitor General, I know the inhabitants of that office will argue whatever halfway respectable arguments the Justice Department and, indirectly, the President, wants made.)\n\nBefore the Obama administration, Srinivasan worked for five years in George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department. Prior to that, as an attorney in the private firm of O'Melveny & Myers, he defended Exxon Mobil in a lawsuit brought by Indonesians who accused the company\u2019s security forces of torture, murder, and other violations against their people; successfully represented a newspaper that fired its employees for unionizing; and defended Enron\u2019s former CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, later convicted for financial fraud. But in these instances, too, it could be argued he was just representing clients. Another clue: After graduating Stanford Law School in 1995, Srinivasan clerked for two Republican-appointed jurists \u2013 Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, and Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \u2013 both of whom were considered moderate.\n\nSince he became a judge on the D.C. Circuit, he hasn\u2019t tipped his hand. But I discovered one morsel of information that might interest you: In 2000, he worked on Al Gore\u2019s legal team in the infamous Supreme Court case of \u201cBush v. Gore.\u201d\n\nMy suspicion is Obama couldn't do better than Srinivasan. No other nominee with get a majority of Senate votes. What do you think?' - Robert Reich Facebook post 2/14/16"

Might be the conspiracy ideas in me but I cant get this out of my head. From what Ive seen the republicans say many crazy things and nothing about real politics or change. It seems like a game show. I saw the questions by Anderson Cooper to the republicans and it made me wonder what people saw in these candidates. I had no idea what each candidate stood for to make them stand out. well politically i had no idea. but which one I would like the best as a tv personality it would be rubio because he likes EDM............*face palm* \n\nSo...... the conspiracy part is that the republicans and democrats like Hilliary are all on the same team by big money interest\n\nthe republics have two objectives. \n\n1. by grabbing the attentions of voters not by policies but by personality. to distract or pull in voters with reality tv esqe techniques. ala not even real presidential candidate questions. *cough* Anderson cooper\n\n2. the crazy things that the republics do and say is an attempt to help trick us to believe Hilliary is a normal and for the people candidate. there aren't two parties. there is one party but the anti progressive and oligarchic agendas needs to be hidden. \n\nnot sure if any of that makes sense. its late and I might have written it like i was in fourth grade. sorry. lol please let me know what you guys think"

        "num_comments": 2,
        "description": "You\u2019ve heard one of GOP front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s constant boasts:  The nation\u2019s 56 million Hispanics \u201clove\u201d me, he says.  Never mind that Trump started his campaign last summer with harsh words for Mexico and Mexican illegal immigrants, implying that many were \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cserial killers.\u201d  Or that partly as a result, a string of polls have shown him winning no more than 16% of the Hispanic vote in hypothetical head-to-head match-ups with either of his prospective Democratic rivals in the general election,  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nTrump\u2019s proof of success with Hispanics?  Exit polls from last week\u2019s Nevada caucuses, which he won handily over his GOP rivals.  According to those polls, the billionaire real estate mogul captured a whopping 44% of the Hispanic vote -- about 10% of the total.  That certainly seems impressive, on its face.  Trump even outpaced the Hispanic support of his two leading GOP rivals, freshmen senators Marco Rubio (29%) and Ted Cruz (18%), and both men, unlike Trump, are Hispanic.\n\nBut here\u2019s the hitch.  Of the state\u2019s Hispanic voters, just 16% are registered Republicans.  A much larger share -- two-thirds -- are Democrats.  That leaves about a fifth who are independents.  In other words, Trump won a near-majority among a fairly narrow slice of Nevada\u2019s Hispanics.  It\u2019s unclear how he would fare with Hispanics in Nevada as a whole.\n\nChances are, at least presently, not that well.  Republican Hispanics are generally older, wealthier, and more \u201cassimilated\u201d than Democratic Hispanics.  In fact, a much higher percentage tends to be US-born with deep roots in the United States.  Hispanics with long-standing US residence often express a fear and opposition to illegal immigration that rivals that of their \u201cAnglo\u201d counterparts.  In fact, they may even more sensitive to the issue because they perceive the influx of illegal Latino immigrants as increasing the chances that they will be mistakenly identified \u2013 and stigmatized \u2013 as \u201cforeigners.\u201d  They also fear competition for jobs.  \n\nAs a result, you often find Republican Hispanics to be among the most anti-illegal immigrant segment of the U.S. voting population, with the highest and most passionate levels of support for expanded border enforcement.  In other words, they\u2019re just the kind of voters that are more likely to support Donald Trump.\n\nBy contrast, Democratic Hispanics tend to be zealously \u201cpro-amnesty.\u201d  They are not in favor of aggressive deportation, much less the building of a border wall.   They are not likely to be open to Trump \u2013 at least, not based on what they have heard so far.\n\nThat was apparent in 2012.   Eighty percent of Nevada\u2019s Hispanics voted for incumbent Barack Obama compared to just 20% for Republican contender Mitt Romney -- a huge 4-1 margin.  With the GOP pegged as completely unsympathetic to the plight of illegal immigrants, Obama ended up running the tables with Hispanics, capturing Democrats and independents alike.  Much the same occurred in key Latino-rich battleground states like Colorado and Florida \u2013 and it damaged Romney\u2019s chances of winning the election. \n\nCould Trump do better in 2016?  Actually, he might.  According to Gallup 23% of all US Hispanics favor a get tough approach with illegal immigration \u2013 up from 17% several years ago.  These voters in the main are Republicans, not Democrats.  And the more of them you can get to the polls, the higher the GOP\u2019s Hispanic support will be.  Trump\u2019s candidacy was an important reason for the record turnout \u2013 including Hispanic turnout -- in the Nevada caucuses. Apparently, Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great\u201d message is resonating just as sharply with Hispanic Republicans as it is with GOP voters generally.  That\u2019s clearly good news.    \n\nAnd Trump may also have a chance to win over Hispanic independents and some Hispanic Democrats.   In recent months, he\u2019s tried to soften his tough immigration rhetoric by insisting that his approach to the border, unlike Romney\u2019s, is \u201chumane\u201d.   He\u2019s gone out of his way to say that he supports legal immigration.  And it turns out that most illegal immigrants, once they agree to leave, can still return legally, according to Trump\u2019s plan.  \n\nThat\u2019s actually a softening of current US law, which bans deported illegals from applying for legal residency for at least three years \u2013 but in many cases, ten.   In fact, many Republican hard-liners, including Ted Cruz, would like to permanently ban illegal aliens from ever re-entering the country.  Not Trump.  It\u2019s an important distinction that more moderate Latino voters may not have heard yet.  But they will soon enough, assuming Trump wins his party\u2019s nomination.  \n\nFor now, Trump\u2019s approach is working extremely well with Hispanic Republicans \u2013 and not just in Nevada.   The former reality TV star is narrowly leading among GOP Hispanics in Texas \u2013 40% to 38% over Ted Cruz -- and that\u2019s in Cruz\u2019s home state, where Cruz enjoys a double-digit lead overall.  In Rubio\u2019s home state of Florida, Trump gets 47% of the Hispanic Republican vote, compared to just 25% for Rubio and 17% for Cruz.  That\u2019s even more remarkable when you consider that most Florida Hispanics, like Rubio and Cruz, are Cuban-Americans with a distinct relationship to their homeland.\n\nThe upshot?  Reaching Hispanics nationwide remains a challenge for Republicans, given public perceptions of their antipathy toward immigrants.  But if Trump\u2019s \u201chumane\u201d message is this powerful within the GOP, don\u2019t be surprised if it starts to transcend party lines, too. \n"

So it would probably help Trump a lot if Cruz eked out a win in Texas. If Cruz loses to Trump in Texas, he would in all likelihood withdraw from the race. The last thing that Trump wants is a narrower field of candidates. So the longer Cruz stays in the race, the better it is for Trump, certainly until March 15. So a win for Cruz is in many ways a win for Trump. "

        "description": "For example: Alabama. It has 50 delegates: 29 are proportionate* across the state (of which 3 are RNC and are unbound), and 21 are allocated on a district basis. The proportionate rules for both the state-wide and district are (excluding invalid cases this time around) that the 29 at-large delegates are to be proportionally allocated to the presidential contenders to those candidates receiving 20% or more the vote. Ignoring rounding as that only explains +/- 1\n\nCurrently, AP are saying that with 100% of the votes in, Trump got 28 delegates and Cruz 2, with everyone else 0.\n\nSo where are the missing 20 delegates? Are people waiting for some results to come in, and if so, why is it listed as 100% complete?\n\nhttp://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/AL-R has some numbers - I'm not sure if they're accurate/trustworthy though.\n\nThis situation is currently present for pretty much all super tuesday states, for both GOP and Dems."

I think it is outragous Trump can evern get followers. In high school we were taught about the US government system and the two impeached presidents. If for whatever reason Trump were to be elected couldn't we (we as in the majority of the common people) start a patition to impeach Trump before he is fully signed into the president role? \nI may not know much about the legal works behind impeachment, but shouldn't that work? Why or why not? \nThanks anyone and everyone who replies! "

Looking at the front page of the politics subreddit, you'd never even know there was a Republican debate last night. I'd like to see some news and information that doesn't get downvoted so that some article from a half competent source can get upvoted because it favors Bernie or slams Clinton. "

Clinton is trying to limit the conversation to those children seeking asylum. Ramos pushes her about expanding no deportations to include non-criminals. Bernie goes all in and says no deportation of children (fine, seeking asylum) and those without criminal records (everyone who's ever set foot and will ever set foot in the US now won't be deported!)\n\nRAMOS: So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obama\u2019s deportation policy. And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants. So if you really don\u2019t want to be the next deporter in chief, can you promise tonight that you won\u2019t deport children and that you won\u2019t deport immigrants who don\u2019t have a criminal record and this time, could I get a yes or no answer?\n\nCLINTON: Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum.\n\nRAMOS: But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you won\u2019t deport children, children who are already here?\"\n\nCLINTON: I will not deport children. I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That\u2019s a relatively small universe.\n\nRAMOS: OK. So I want to be very specific. So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you won\u2019t deport children who are already here?\n\nCLINTON: I will not.\n\nRAMOS: And that you won\u2019t deport immigrants who don\u2019t have a criminal record?\n\nCLINTON: That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. Now I don\u2019t want \u2014 because I\u2019m not contradicting what I told you in the interview. Asylum is a particular legal process. I\u2019d like to see it changed. I\u2019d like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do. But under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.\n\nRAMOS: So you will stop those deportations.\n\nCLINTON: I would stop...\n\nRAMOS: The deportations for children...\n\nCLINTON: Yes.\n\nRAMOS: ... and those who don\u2019t have a criminal record.\nCLINTON: Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported. I want to see them on a path to citizenship. That is exactly what I will do. then Ramos asks Sanders, again not mention asylum.\n\nRAMOS: Senator Sanders, would you \u2014 can you promise us tonight that you won\u2019t deport children?\n\nSANDERS: Let me just say this. I don\u2019t think that the secretary fully answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding. Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere. Gang lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families. Children fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a new life. Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country. I did. Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues. I think he has done a great job as president of the United States. He is wrong on this issue of deportation. I disagree with him on that.\n\nSANDERS: So to answer your question, no, I will not deport children from the United States of America.\n\nRAMOS: And can you promise not to deport immigrants who don\u2019t have a criminal record?\n\nSANDERS: I can make that promise.\n\nhttp://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/immigration-turning-point-clinton-and-sanders-hits-just-florida-primary\n"

Now we all know that Trump disavowed the KKK recently and even years ago, so for them to run this headline is just pure race baiting and full of lies.\n\nAnd don't get me started on George Stephanopoulos at ABC news. Now it's been confirmed that [George Stephanopoulos has personally donated $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation](http://dailycaller.com/2015/05/19/stephanopoulos-clinton-ties-go-even-deeper-than-revealed/).

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "It sounds like an absurd plan.  Hillary Clinton has largely vanquished Bernie Sanders as an alternative to her candidacy from the left.  She has a lock on African-American voters, and to a lesser extent, Latino voters.  She generally beats the 74-year old self-described socialist among women, especially older women.  She runs extremely well in the South, the stronghold of the Republican Party.  \n\nShould Clinton win the nomination this summer, which seems likely, what would she need Sanders for?\n\t\nThe answer is simple: party unity. Sanders has exposed a deep rift inside the Democratic Party that Clinton alone will be unable to heal.  Most Sanders supporters are strongly opposed to Clinton; they see her as \u201cRepublican-Lite.\u201d They don\u2019t just disagree with her on policy they vehemently oppose her as a figurehead of a corrupt political establishment that has caused poverty and misery for many Democratic base voters.  Clinton may well decide to ignore Sanders and choose a running mate more to her liking \u2013 Julian Castro, the charismatic former mayor of San Antonio who currently heads up the federal housing authority HUD, is often mentioned as a prospective VP choice.  So is Tim Kaine, the former DNC chair and current Virginia senator, who might help Clinton carry a key battleground state in the general election.\n\t\nThe problem?  These candidates, while flashing liberal credentials, may not be able to galvanize Sanders supporters, especially his overwhelming support among youth and working class voters.  In a year of the political outsider, in which GOP front-runner Donald Trump threatens to cross over and scoop up disaffected Democrats, including Sanders supporters, this could prove fatal to the Clinton campaign unless Sanders himself is on the ticket.\n\t\nRecall that Barack Obama faced a similar dilemma in 2008.  Clinton ran neck-and-neck with Obama and even bested him in the last month of the campaign.  Clinton supporters were so upset at her loss that they demanded that Obama put her on the ticket.  For a while, it even appeared that this might happen, and for much the same reason that Clinton must now consider Sanders.  Without the active support of Hillary and her base \u2013 she bested him 2-1 among Hispanics, for example \u2013 Obama\u2019s team worried he might not have a unified party behind him.\n\t\nObama, in the end, worked out a different deal.  He quietly offered Clinton a top post in his cabinet, as well as future White House support for a second Clinton presidential bid, which apparently mollified her. But he chose a \u201cgraybeard\u201d \u2013 Joe Biden \u2013 a member of the white male Democratic political establishment that could vouch for his candidacy among wavering independents.  In hindsight, it was a brilliant stroke.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThe difference with Sanders is at least twofold.  First, Clinton has nothing to offer him that might lead the Vermont senator to broker such a deal.   At his age, he is in the twilight of his political career.  Sure, he could accept a token nomination as Secretary of Labor, but in the American executive branch, that\u2019s a junior appointment at best.  Sanders has emerged as a leading voice in the Senate on immigration and veterans issues, and consigning him to such a narrow portfolio would be practically an insult.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more important, there\u2019s a real chance that Sanders \u2013 or his supporters -- will stay neutral \u2013 or tepid \u2013 if Clinton is the nominee.  His disagreements with her go far beyond the rifts that developed between JFK and LBJ among Democrats in 1960 or Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush among Republicans in 1980. Sanders is not even a Democrat and though he caucuses with the party in the Senate, he has a real independent streak on guns and trade and military intervention, for example.  And pressure from his own base \u2013 including calls for a third-party bid -- could also keep him from fully backing a Clinton ticket in the fall.   \n\nIn the end, the real problem for Clinton is that her candidacy draws most of its energy and legitimacy from Sanders.  Prior to his entry into the race, she was planning to run as a center-left candidate to the right of Barack Obama.  To win Obama\u2019s support and to accommodate the party base, she has since shifted most of her domestic policy positions to the left.  It\u2019s worked sufficiently to overtake Sanders in the race for the nomination but it has left the Sanders movement \u2013 and Sanders - with an unusual degree of moral authority that she now avoids at her peril.\n\nThe chief argument against putting Sanders on the ticket is that he pulls the Democratic ticket even further to the left.  But many Democratic strategists believe the party needs to concentrate more on mobilizing its base than wooing a relatively small sliver of independent voters.  And don\u2019t forget, Sanders actually polls far better than Clinton does against the entire GOP field.  Is he really such a liability?\n\nJust as some Republicans are anticipating an unwieldy Donald Trump-Ted Cruz pairing as a way out of an ugly impasse on the right, don\u2019t be surprised if a Clinton-Sanders ticket emerges for the same reason on the left.  Both parties desperately need to consolidate and unify their warring internal constituencies. And once they do, it could turn the November race into an unusually fierce and unpredictable contest.\n"

        "num_comments": 2,
        "description": "This petition is to request the DNC to allow The Young Turks to host a debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Having a media outlet NOT INFLUENCED by Corporate Money would show the rest of the Main Stream Media how to host a debate. Cenk Uygur, Ana Kasparian, Jimmy Dore and John Iadarola can go toe to toe with ANY MSM \"Journalists\". \n\nWe want to see a debate where Sanders and Clinton can be properly questioned about policy with appropriate followups. The Young Turks have a huge out reach online and it would be a great opportunity to discuss in depth issues that are important for the DNC and for the whole nation. \n\nPlease share http://chn.ge/1ZuqTJX on social media (Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, wherever else you can) so we can get even more.\n17,000 signatures was enough to get Sanders on TYT and we easily surpassed that benchmark in less than 24 hours! I never expected to reach 35,000 signatures this quickly, but it will take a lot more for Clinton/Schultz/DNC to get on board!\n\nTo the naysayers, I say that remember when Clinton had a \"Scheduling Conflict\" when Fox asked her to be on the Town Hall? No one EVER believed Clinton would appear on Fox. Well Sanders was up for it and she didn't have much choice so she agreed! Bernie has already appeared on TYT 1 on 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggFitmOTSok \nA TYT Debate can happen too!\n\nKeep tweeting @BernieSanders, @HillaryClinton, @DWStweets & @CenkUygur \n\n\nNot much time left in the election process so Lets make this happen!\nShare the link http://chn.ge/1ZuqTJX\n\n-Saad Qidwai"

        "description": "By Stewart Lawrence\n\nWill America\u2019s two-party system survive the 2016 election?  \n\nFor the first time in decades, large numbers of voters in both parties are turning to \u201coutsider\u201d candidates that threaten the power and prerogatives of party bosses \u2013 and those bosses are striking back, with potentially disastrous consequences for them and their parties. \t\t\n\nThey\u2019re not just throwing obstacles in the way of insurgent candidates.  They\u2019re even threatening to unseat upstart candidates that play by the rules and win \u2013 never mind that millions of loyal party voters will be disenfranchised in the process.\n\nThe case of Donald Trump has already become a public embarrassment for the GOP.   Party leaders are openly contemptuous of their front-runner \u2013 and desperate to push him aside.\n\nThe main arguments against Trump are that he\u2019s not a true-blue Republican and that he\u2019s driving so many women and minorities away that the GOP will be crushed in November.  \n\nBut Trump is racking up delegates, and under party rules, may well come to the convention with the requisite 1,237 delegates in his pocket to claim the nomination.\n\nExcept that not everyone in the party wants to play by the rules.  Some feel perfectly justified in scheming to take away Trump\u2019s delegates at the convention and creating a first-ballot nightmare that will allow them to draft their own favored candidate.  Some say it might be House Majority leader Paul Ryan, even though Ryan\u2019s never competed in the primaries and has uncertain support in the party to boot. \n\nDemocrats, it turns out, have their own \u201cTrump problem.\u201d  His name is Bernie Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist who is giving the party\u2019s chosen candidate, Hillary Clinton, fits because he refuses to fold his tent.  In fact, Sanders plans to go all the way to the convention and conceivably deprive Clinton of a first-ballot majority.\n\nClinton pledged to \u201cclose out\u201d the race in March, but Sanders is on a hot streak, having won 8 of the last 9 contests.  He\u2019s also running neck-and-neck with Clinton in three straight national polls while closing the gap in key upcoming states like New York and Pennsylvania\n\nThe party has already done its best to put its stamp of approval on Clinton by assigning 15% of the total delegates to unelected \u201csuper-delegates\u201d comprised of elected officials -- primarily members of Congress.  Without the super-delegates, Sanders would be trailing Clinton by a mere 250 delegates.  But Clinton leads Sanders 469-31 among the super-delegates, which gives her a 688 delegate advantage overall.  \n\nThe problem?  Those super-delegates voted for Clinton even in states where Sanders won the popular vote and garnered a majority of the pledged delegates.  That means they are voting against the will of the voters they claim to represent \u2013 hardly a hallmark of democracy.\n\nNow Sander is demanding that these super-delegates switch their votes to his column \u2013 which nearly all, thus far, have refused to do.  \n\nEven worse, should Sanders somehow manage to tease away enough support from super-delegates pledged to Clinton \u2013 or the 212 not yet committed \u2013 and manage to force an open convention, the party may have a surprise in store.  As with the GOP, they could well find someone else to be their standard-bearer \u2013 Joe Biden, for example \u2013 even if, like Ryan, he never ran in the primaries.  \n\nIn short, neither party establishment is prepared to accept that the insurgent candidate as their nominee regardless of what the voters say.\n\nAnd yet the consequences of failing to respect the popular will could well be severe.  \n\nTrump has energized the GOP, bringing millions of new voters to the polls.  If he fails to win after gaining the largest number of delegates, he could well bolt from the party \u2013 or his supporters might just stay home and not vote.  That could spell disaster for the GOP, polls show.\n\nDemocrats face the same problem:  Sanders is the passion and fury of the party.  Without him leading the ticket, or perhaps on it, more than a third of his supporters say they won\u2019t vote.  Some might even cross over and support Trump.\n\nPolitical scientists have referred to the upsurge in democracy in the Middle East as the \u201cArab Spring.\u201d  Among Republicans and Democrats alike, it\u2019s viewed as a welcome trend, and one that needs to be encouraged to prevent the rise of violent extremism.\n\nBut the two parties seem far less encouraging of this year\u2019s \u201cAmerican Spring.\u201d  Voters demanding greater accountability from their leaders are being dismissed as wild yahoos who don\u2019t seem to understand the complexities and nuances of governance \u2013 and the need for benevolent \u201ctutelage\u201d by party elites.\n\nWho knows, maybe Trump and Sanders will decide to bow out gracefully, accept a plum speaking slot at the convention and a role in shaping the party platform, and agree to endorse the establishment candidate.\n\nAfter all, that\u2019s how these things typically end.  \n\nBut in 2016, the natives are more restless than ever.  Sixty-percent of American voters now say they would support a third party movement and candidate \u2013 up from just 40% in 2004.  In some ways Trump \u2013 who\u2019s a complete outsider -- and Sanders \u2013 who\u2019s an independent not a Democrat -- already reflect this sentiment.\n\nWhich means the two parties better figure out how to accommodate the rising discontent in their ranks before they find themselves swept aside.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "By Stewart Lawrence\n\nFive of the last six national polls show Bernie Sanders tied with Hillary Clinton in the battle for the Democratic nomination for president. It\u2019s an election-year precedent and a sure sign that Sanders \u2013 despite debilitating losses in states like Ohio, Illinois, and Florida \u2013 is continuing to hold his own with the former Secretary of State. But with virtually the entire Democratic establishment already in the tank for Hillary, can the beleaguered Vermont senator actually come back and win the nomination?\n\nThe Clinton camp insists that her sizable lead in the delegate count \u2013 688, if you count unelected party \u201csuper-delegates,\u201d but just 244 in the pledged tallies -- makes her the inevitable nominee. But these latest polls, coming on the heels of a string of impressive Sanders triumphs in caucuses in Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and Colorado, his decisive primary win in Wisconsin, and victories in 9 of the last 10 contests overall suggest that Clinton may no longer be the Democrats\u2019 undisputed front-runner after all.\n\nBut don\u2019t tell that to the mainstream media. They\u2019ve virtually ignored Sanders\u2019 20,000-plus rallies throughout Manhattan in recent weeks and his narrowing of a 48-point Clinton lead in the Empire State a month ago to just 10 points in the latest statewide poll.  In Pennsylvania, Clinton led Sanders by 25 points in mid-march, but the latest poll shows her up by just 11. And polls in Indiana and West Virginia all point to Sanders blow-out victories in the weeks ahead -- victories that could well narrow her delegate lead substantially.\n\nA closer look at the recent national and state polls shows why Sanders is surging. His wide lead among younger voters (18-29 year olds) and Democratic-leaning independents is already well-established. But Clinton\u2019s one-time super-advantage with minority voters is collapsing. Two of the three latest national polls show Sanders either tied with or beating Clinton among Latino voters \u2013 an extraordinary reversal from just two months ago. And Clinton has less than a 2-1 advantage over Sanders among African-Americans after besting him 8-1 among this demographic in contests in the South, the latest polls show.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the gender divide. In past polls, Sanders led Clinton among men while Clinton bested him among women. But the two are essentially tied now among women while Sanders still leads among men.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what accounts for Sanders\u2019 ability to close the gap. One factor may be improved name recognition. Until recently, national polls continued to show at least 20% of the Democratic had yet to form an opinion about him. But, apparently, as more voters get to know Sanders, and he continues to win contests, he\u2019s also gaining in popularity. That\u2019s not a good trend line for Clinton.\n\nA second factor may be the continuing drip-drip of scandal that continues to fall on the former First Lady, deepening the perception that she is dishonest and untrustworthy. Her favorability rating among Democratic voters remains high, but among voter groups where Sanders has the advantage, her numbers tank. Overall, Sanders is now viewed more favorably than Clinton by Democrats, a complete reversal of the trend recorded last December.\n\nThen there are the issues. Sanders\u2019 increasingly aggressive attacks on Clinton for her close ties to Wall Street \u2013 including her exorbitant speaking fees for speeches that she refuses to release to the public -- seem to be drawing blood. On the question of which candidate Democratic voters trust more to deal with the economy \u2013 clearly the defining issue in the race \u2013 Sanders comes out on top.\n\nStill, none of these latest surveys guarantee that Sanders will remain in close contention. A big win for Clinton in New York on April 19 will likely damage Sander\u2019s prospects, just as a loss for Clinton will severely damage hers. And Sanders, despite besting Clinton by a substantial margin in head-to-head polling against all GOP candidates still suffers from the perception that Clinton is more \u201celectable.\u201d Many Democratic voters suspect that a self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d would be highly vulnerable in a general election, and that Clinton, as the first prospective female president, still has the \u201cweight of history\u201d on her side.\n\nBut the biggest obstacle is simply the determination of party leaders to hand Clinton the nomination. Most but by no means all of the party\u2019s super-delegates have already swung in her favor. In 2008, they eventually swung away from Clinton to embrace Barack Obama, but with Obama now firmly in the Clinton camp \u2013 even privately urging Sanders to drop out -- there isn\u2019t enough pressure inside the party to force a similar swing toward Sanders \u2013 at least not when Clinton still enjoys a lead among pledged delegates.\n\nSanders would need big victories in at least some of the remaining delegate-rich states to have a shot at besting Clinton in the pledged delegate fight. In theory, that\u2019s still possible. A Sanders win or near-win in New York on Clinton\u2019s home turf, coupled with new and more damaging revelations from the ongoing FBI investigation, could conceivably keep voters shifting his way. And if Sanders also wins most of the remaining uncommitted super-delegates (212) or peels off enough of those currently committed to Clinton (469 out of 500), it could deny her an outright majority leading to the Democrats\u2019 nightmare scenario \u2013 an open or brokered convention.\n\nEven so, Sanders might still end up the Democratic Donald Trump \u2013 ahead in the delegate count, but far too distrusted by the party establishment to become the nominee. When it comes to presidential party politics, denial isn't just an attitude -- it's also a crushing power play.\n"

At the very least, I do a bit of research instead of just regurgitating the stuff I see on Facebook. I do know which candidate I like and have solid reasoning for that. I am registered to vote and figure that I should get a better grasp on this stuff before I start screwing things up for everyone. That said...\n\nWhy should I vote? I have a very cursory concept of how delegates or the electoral college works, and I'm of the understanding that the vote of the individual citizen isn't taken into account when deciding who's actually going to be the president. That's what the delegates and the electoral college is for, right?\n\nNow, I know I'm probably wrong in most of my assumptions here. So can someone please either correct me or at least point me to a place where I can figure out why I should vote?"

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "By Stewart Lawrence\n\nHillary Clinton's promise to pursue aggressive \"pro-immigration\" and \"anti-gun\" policies if she wins the White House this November must rank as one of the worst examples of election-year pandering in recent memory. \n\nClinton has seized upon two issues that have special emotional appeal to Democratic-leaning voter constituencies -- Hispanics and women, respectively -- in the hopes that they will flock to her candidacy and provide a decisive edge over presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. \n\nBut there\u2019s something Clinton isn\u2019t telling these constituencies: Even if she decides to promote her expansive agenda, a hostile Republican-dominated Congress will quickly shut her down. Chairmen of the relevant committees and subcommittees will prevent Clinton\u2019s proposed initiatives from being debated let alone sent to the floor for a vote. \n\nIn short, what Clinton\u2019s proposing \u2013 for example, an even more far-reaching amnesty program than Obama\u2019s -- is already DOA. \n\nTrue, Clinton could always try to use executive orders to impose her agenda without a legislative mandate. That\u2019s what President Obama ultimately did with his two sweeping executive orders that temporarily legalized some 5 million undocumented immigrants. He even threatened to do the same with gun control.\n\nBut two lower courts have already declared Obama\u2019s executive actions unconstitutional. Now the matter is before the US Supreme Court which is expected to rule next month. Most observers expect the Court to deadlock at 4-4, which will let the lower court rulings stand, overturning Obama's two orders. Even without establishing a legal precedent, that decision will put a real chill on further efforts by Clinton -- or any other president -- to try a blatant end-around Congress on immigration -- or on any other issue, including gun control.\n\nNot that Clinton won\u2019t be tempted to try. In theory, she might move to amend Obama\u2019s immigration's orders, eventually sending the matter back to the High Court. But early in her administration, such a provocative move would likely end any hope of bipartisan cooperation with Republicans on other issues. And there\u2019s still no guarantee that the High Court would rule in her favor, even if she managed to get a 9th \u2013 and presumably more sympathetic -- Supreme Court Justice confirmed by the Congress, filling the vacancy left by deceased judge Antonin Scalia.\n\nRather than pandering to base voters, Clinton would be better off telling them that she hopes to make common cause with the Republican opposition. At least that would start the next cycle of debate from the real balance of forces in the Congress. But that\u2019s not likely to get too many base voters fired up about her candidacy. She\u2019d rather make extravagantly unrealistic promises and then blame Republican \u201cintransigence\u201d when they aren\u2019t realized. Democrats already tried this diversionary tactic under President Obama \u2013 and it only got more Republicans elected.\n\nObama, in fact, enjoyed a much more favorable climate in which to pursue immigration reform and gun control, but he squandered his advantage early. He promised Hispanics he\u2019d pass an amnesty program his first year in office \u2013 and he actually had the votes to do it. Instead, he chose to expend his political capital on ObamaCare which made further bipartisan cooperation on a whole host of issues -- including immigration - impossible. \n\nOn gun control, Obama so feared a potential voter backlash that he didn\u2019t even bother to develop a legislative agenda until the mass shooting in Newtown, CT in 2012. But despite appointing a high-level panel chaired by Vice-president Joe Biden, Congress, under no real pressure from their constituents, saw no reason to budge and pass legislation. \n\nClinton, should she win in Novemeber, would take office in much weaker shape than Obama did in 2008. Since 2015, polls show that voters want to see a tougher crackdown on illegal immigrants, including more aggressive deportation efforts. And while there are concerns about closing some loopholes in current gun sale laws, support for citizen 2nd amendment gun ownership rights is stronger than ever.\n\nAnd yet despite this conservative tilt, Clinton\u2019s already promising a more far-reaching \u2013 and unrealistic \u2013 agenda. This is pandering pure and simple, and it\u2019s likely to disappoint base voters yet again. In fact, there\u2019s no guarantee that once she's elected, Clinton would actually try to confront Republicans on these issues. Initially, Obama certainly didn\u2019t.\n\nBut that could result in a further loss of credibility for the Democrats \u2013 and for Clinton. And more opportunities for Republicans to advance. In the end, Clinton's pandering is both irresponsible and self-defeating. "

So, if the Republican/Democratic/RandoThirdParty were to re-form into a new coalition, what would it look like? I'm looking for any data I can get, but I'm especially looking for the following groups:\n\n*Protestants (Evangelical and Mainline)\n\n*People over 30\n\n*People without college degrees\n\n*Moderates\n\n*Women\n\n*Trump supporters\n\n*People from somewhere other than the East or West coast\n\nRegistered US voters only please!\n\nThe survey is 42 questions long, and takes about 5 minutes. I would really appreciate it if you could help me get some data! You should be able to see the results so far after you take it (unless I fucked up with SurveyMonkey). Hopefully I can get enough to do a proper statistical analysis.\nThanks again!\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MBVN3B2\n(Edited for formatting)\n"

        "description": "I'm a liberal, no doubt about that shit, right, but I'd like everyone's opinions on the gun laws in the U.S. \n({[OPINION OF MINE IS BELOW]})\nPersonally I believe that they don't particularly help us, the real point of holding a gun? In my opinion, there's no real point. Some pro-gun users would say that guns would stop an attempted murder, but no-one with a gun (I don't believe) has ever stopped a murderer with a gun. unless they were part of the police force. And even when you are a cop, you can't always be trusted with a gun. \n\n\nThere are no real reasons for having a gun, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A YOUNG CHILD. \n\"There have been at least 43 shootings carried by children under the age of three in the United States so far this year. Guns left within reach of toddlers can have tragic consequences.\" (Telegraph Newspaper) If you are a parent, there is NO FUCKING REASON for you to have a gun. No Reason AT ALL. Like seriously, you are more likely to have your child accidentally kill themselves then you are to stop an attempted murder on your child.\n\nNow, if you are in a troubled relationship, don't own a FUCKING GUN YOU IDIOT! the chances of you pulling the trigger on someone in your pure anger ARE VERY HIGH!! You may think that you could never do that, but people don't always realize what they're doing in anger. \n\nAmong that, most gun murders have been by people that just WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A GUN FROM A SHOP. The percentage of people that successfully stopped a murder with a gun are so very low. Yet the murder rate is going down, but the chances of getting murdered by someone with a gun are STILL HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE STOPPING OF THE MURDERS WITH PRIVATELY OWNED GUNS!!!!! \n\"For every criminal killed in self-defense, 34 innocent people die\" according to the Guardian.\n\nAgain, I'm just a small child with infinite resources that supports Obama and Hillary. So I would like to hear your opinion and your reasoning.\n\n-Thanks\nAnd I'm out boys!!! \n"

        "description": "/r/Trumplicans is a dedicated subreddit to local politicians that share our values. The Republican party is in the wake of a revolution. Many of us are tired of the evangelical takeover, the globalist takeover, the special interest takeover, and the overall elitism of the Republican Party. We believe in conservative economic, trade, and militaristic policies. We believe in reasonable social policies. We believe in Trump, we believe in those that support him, and we believe in the growing number of politicians arising that reflect Trump's views. This election is a turning point in American, if not World, politics. A rise of nationalism, and end to globalism, and and end to political correctness and thought police. These are the things we're finally shifting for, Soros and his crew be damned.\nKeep in mind, /r/the_donald already exists, and is already amazingly huge and active. Of course /r/Trumplicans LOVES this subreddit, but we don't want to just become a smaller version of /r/the_donald. We ask that you don't just repost the same Trump content that you see on this subreddit, but rather focus your spicy memology on the growing Trumplican politicians. And, of course, dank shitposts are always welcome.\n"

One example - I know that authentic haggis cannot be found in the United States, due to a ban on sheep lungs. Could the TTIP, if passed, hypothetically lift that ban (for imports anyway)? Or for another example, could Volkswagen go back to importing cars that don't meet US emissions standards?"

There's also no real way to bring change to the UK while it remains part of the EU.\n\nBut in America, its public knowledge that the elections aren't ultimately made by the people, just by \"representatives\". That the people running for president are more or less all related, Clinton and Trump are distant cousins, and we've just had the THIRD Bush running for nominee, and the second Clinton. Moreover, why does America put up with the weird two party system? Both parties are liars and corrupt, so why does anyone vote for either?\n\nTo the British, American elections are seen as a joke, since so much of the process is run like a reality TV show. And the choices are so superficial.. Do you want the \"Woman\"? Do you want the \"White Man\"? Do you want the \"Socialist\"?\nThe reason those are in quotation marks is that they run by those aspects alone. Their policies are all the same, except for on issues that divide the populace at the current moment, to give an illusion of difference.\n\nDoes no American wonder why the Republican candidate isn't against gay marriage this time around? Or why the Democrats, who introduced the Jim Crow laws, are now the \"progressive\" party? Because its all tailored, in a very designed way, to appeal to the people who just go with whatever is on TV at that time.\n\nAnyway, rant over. And don't bother saying anything about me, I don't care, just respond to the things I've said, since that is what most people in the UK view America as."

As a typical independent voter with a brain, and as such one of the controlling plurality of American voters, I need answers to some questions before I can consider doing so.\n\nFirst, some background charts and graphs: \n\n* [US tuition and healthcare are both increasing faster than incomes](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Blogs/2014/11/25-scott-blog/Median-income-and-change-in-price-of-select-goods-for-blog.jpg) ([source](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/the-avenue/posts/2014/11/25-innovation-price-index-andes-muro)), and \n\n* [The US middle class no longer participates in economic recoveries](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f4c1a3_41160468c4d04a2d9c24592dbf94ed99.jpg/v1/fill/w_803,h_428,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/f4c1a3_41160468c4d04a2d9c24592dbf94ed99.jpg) ([source](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/pn_15_4.pdf).)\n\nSo my current issues preventing me from supporting Hillary Clinton are:\n\n1. Why do [her higher education proposals](http://www.documentcloud.org/search/preview?q=projectid%3A+21826-hillary-clinton-higher-ed-white-papers+&slug=projectid-21826-hillary-clinton-higher-ed-white-papers&options=%7B%22q%22%3A%22projectid%3A+21826-hillary-clinton-higher-ed-white-papers+%22%2C%22container%22%3A%22%23DC-search-projectid-21826-hillary-clinton-higher-ed-white-papers%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Hillary+Clinton+Higher+Education+Plans%22%2C%22order%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22per_page%22%3A%2212%22%2C%22search_bar%22%3Afalse%2C%22organization%22%3A830%7D) not include anything like \"debt free college\" that she claimed on December 19? Why do they have no tuition caps, no caps on college administrator pay (which has been skyrocketing [in the US as fast as CEO salaries](https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2014/09/It-pays-to-be-a-CEO-in-the-U-S-The-ratio-between-CEO-and-average-worker-pay_chartbuilder.png)), or any support for the salaries of adjunct faculty, who in many if not most cases are on food assistance?\n\n2. Why on https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/ is \"public option\" in scare quotes instead of being [hyperlinked to a bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3737) or other implementation plan for financial analysis?\n\n3. How can we reconcile her [approval of international arms sales of guns used in US mass shootings](https://twitter.com/GoldmanHandcuff/status/732039609719214080) ([source](https://medium.com/@JeanetteJing/secretary-clinton-approved-millions-in-global-sales-for-the-sandy-hook-gun-maker-9e8b0e78c58d))? This is a big one for me, almost as big as her statement in the first Democratic debate about wanting to send American troops to Syria against Assad and ISIS, both sides in an Iraq-like boondoggle. I am unable to reconcile it with her anti-gun stance. \n\n4. If political donations don't influence her, [why did she stop accepting money from private prisons?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-private-prisons_us_562a3e3ee4b0ec0a389418ec)\n\nAgain, I am going to need answers to these questions before I consider supporting Hillary Clinton, and I believe all thinking independents, who represent the vast plurality of voters in this election, need to know too."

        "description": "Here's something interesting I've noticed about the online/social media tactics of  Bernie Supporters and Hillary Supporters. This is stemming from the many comments I've seen written on news articles, video clips, facebook, twitter, youtube, etc. \n\nBernie supporters often post facts, opinions, or links to news articles and video clips. If they directly criticize, insult, or call someone a name, it\u2019s often targeted towards the politician or article in question. \n \nHRC supporters want Hillary to become president, and they must realize for that to happen they need the support of Independents, Bernie supporters, and some Republicans. Yet on social media, Hillary supporters almost always insult these large groups of people and use offensive language like, \u201cbutt hurt,\u201d \u201ccry baby,\u201d \u201csore loser,\u201d \u201cBernie cult,\u201d \"Bernie bro,\" \u201cnot a true democrat,\u201d \u201clunatics,\u201d \u201ctea partier,\" \u201cconspiracy theorist,\u201d any variation of \"stupid,\" etc. Do they really think that belittling these people will win them over? Do they not understand that by directly insulting these voters they are damaging their candidate's chances of winning? Maybe they should be discussing Hillary's strong points (other than, \"at least she\u2019s not Trump\") instead?\n\nHave you noticed something similar? Or do think Sanders supporters have been just as bad?"

        "description": "State of Emergency laws are responsible for the authorization of use of force at recent political rallies as well as the Vietnam Draft, the Kent State shootings, the quash of the civil rights movement activism, anti-privacy laws and other injustices due to its ability to dilute or revoke citizens inalienable rights - an act that is unlawful on grounds of unconstitutionality (breaching natural inalienable rights), thus is \"de jure\" (i.e. military coup). The same tactics were used to enact \"legal\" coups in the Wiemar Republic and the Soviet Union which sought to 'legalize' their crimes against the citizens, though it is important to know that there is a difference between that which is LEGAL and that which is UNLAWFUL. Something can be considered \"legal\" while still being unlawful, as in this case.\nhttps://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-difference-between-legal-and-lawful\n\n\"de facto\n:actually existing, especially when without lawful authority.\"\nhttp://www.dictionary.com/browse/de-facto\n\n\"de jure\n:based on laws or actions of the state.\"\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/de%20jure\n\nThis is why the events in the civil rights movement of the 1960s are so similar to now; the citizens still haven't addressed the root cause of the authorization of revocation of U.S. citizens rights. I did the legwork for everyone, so now it's just a matter of spreading the information and holding a referendum on State of Emergency abuses that have resulted in deprivation of inalienable rights of the citizenry in attempt to prevent the further deprivation of the rights, liberties, and freedom of the citizenry.\n\nThe U.S. has been in a perpetual state of emergency since 1979:\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/22/president-obama-\nstates-of-emergency/16851775/\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/11/19/the-united-states-\nis-in-a-state-of-emergency-30-of-them-in-fact/\n\nDo not forget about 'consent of the governed'; it's up to the citizens to repeal laws they do not wish to be held to and propose solutions to civil rights abuses -- a rally/protest may be used to gain support through awareness, but ultimately real change will come from the citizens getting involved in the political system (legislation proposals, local level and state representation changes, petitions, etc...) rather than being led by the media, which has proven its near-treasonous abuse of yellow journalism and sensationalism at the detriment of the public. The media used the exact same tactics today as they did in the 1960s to divide the public and detract from the real issues by focusing on racial division, gender division, and class warfare. United we stand, divided we fall - the injustices are caused by State of Emergency abuses and need to be addressed and amended to ensure the inalienable rights of the people cannot be revoked nor diluted under any circumstance. \n\nSUPPORT THE CAUSE!

        "description": "It's not often that we get moderator posts on this subreddit - this is partially out of a commitment to transparency.\n\n---\n\n#Moderation\n\nThere have been a lot of moderation actions recently, and I'd like to clarify what's been going on.\n\n[This is the moderation log matrix for the past few days.](http://i.imgur.com/JIY0U7o.png)\n\nYou might be wondering why AutoModerator has been so active recently. That's because I've set it to automate certain tasks. Let me outline what they are:\n\n* Removing posts from new accounts (which are likely to be spam accounts)\n\n* Removing posts from accounts below a karma threshold.\n\nI'm not going to delve into specifics, as this will allow people to \"cook\" accounts for spam.\n\n* Referring posts by suspicious users to the moderation queue\n\n* Removing posts from certain domains.\n\nNow, the last point may be worrisome. Let me allay you. \n\nThis subreddit has a very laissez-faire moderation in comparison to others. However, some things really shouldn't be posted here - such as YouTube videos or Facebook posts. Blacklisted domains are almost exclusively social media and blogging platforms, and the vast majority of posts are not filtered. The number of false positives are few, and I've only had to approve about two or three out of eighty articles removed.\n\nWe get a lot of posts for this subreddit's size. As the only active moderator, it's rather difficult for me to sift through the entire moderation queue (which verges on _insanely_ large on busy days). Whilst blanket removals aren't nice, the vast majority of posts aren't affected and it means that there's less spam for my hair to fall out over. \n\n---\n\n#Quality of the subreddit\n\n\nOf course, this isn't nearly close to enough, hence this post. If there's anything you can take away from reading this:\n\n**Please, please please use the \"report\" function.**\n\nThis reduces the amount of spam that we all see on the front page, and makes it easier for me to remove offending posts. \n\nLet's face it, the posts on this subreddit can be bad. Quite bad. Please use the comment section to talk about your qualms - it's high time that this should have happened, and we'll listen to your concerns.\n\n---\n\n#New moderators\n\nOn another note, we need new moderators - one janitor and one person to completely redo the CSS of this subreddit whilst also adding flairs.\n\n(Uncustomised /r/Naut or /r/Minimaluminiumalism isn't what we want.)\n\n**You can apply [here](http://bit.ly/1PcX9Lp).**\n\nPast experience is particularly necessary for the latter position, but not so much for the former. Feel free to apply regardless.\n\nI am also going to request to the top mod that the inactive moderators get removed, although that isn't a pressing issue.\n\n---\n\n#Some of what's going to be happening:\n\n* Link flair.\n\n* Transparency updates.\n\n* New CSS.\n\n---\n\nI'll use the bottom of this post to apologise for moderating this sub opaquely - I endeavour to change that in the future."
