It is clear that Russia seeks to undermine democratic institutions around the world. **But as of now, I have seen no evidence that vote totals in the 50 states or voting machines were affected by any Russian interference.**\n\nSo, as long as nothing results from it. It is okay! I can attempt to kill you, but if I don't, it is okay! I can plan and prepare to kill you, but I have not killed you. *So it is okay!*\n\nThe rest of his response was just the fact that there are ongoing investigations. All true, all important, but the paragraph I linked just blew my mind.\n\nTrying to do something and even doing ground work to do something counts for nothing if it does not actually happen. Heck, going through the action does not count if the result is not what they wanted!"

Allow people to stand against Trump, which (AFAIK) is unprecedented but not actually against any rule. \n2. Remove the party nomination from Trump and then do the usual selection process without him, knowing that he would probably stand as an independent and at the very least split the Republican vote. \n3. Grin and bear it. \n\nI am not asking this for political point scoring reasons, if it helps change the names of parties and presidents round or just make them up. "

Or coming up with policies that could get passed with theoretical help from moderate republicans? \n\nIs politics just  disagreeing with the opposition, just to be contrarian? \n\nJust to be clear, this isn't only about this congress, but in general. \n\nThanks. \n "

However, the First Amendment does not require a public institution to risk imminent violence to students and others. \n\nThe likelihood of violence and potential injury \u2013 not the words or ideas \u2013 has caused us to take this action. \n \nWarm Regards,\n \nW.

        "description": "So right now I have two tabs open, r/politics and r/the_donald, and I was interested in upvote ratio to comments. I can test this with other threads too so feel free to recommend some more left-leaning reddits (even though /politics is pretty heavy left, it definitely will have a mixed result compared to an almost all-right board like t_d). \n\nSo all I did was divide the # of upvotes by the # of comments to get a general sense of activity. I will be going down just the first page of politics and the_donald and then ill get an average for both after. Why am I doing this? I kinda have the feeling they have some bots just spam upvoting t_d threads, but without proof it's just a hunch. I was interested to see what the math would say: (right or wrong on my theory, i'll post my results anyhow)\n\n*u/c= Upvotes per comment*\n\nThe_Donald-\n\n1228.01 total upvotes per comment (as a sum of the upvotes/comments of all threads added up)  on the front page of The_donald (hot). Out of 24 total threads (one had no upvotes displayed for whatever reason, so I skipped over it- same happened in /politics), this results in about:\n\n*Average u/c per thread- 51.7*\n\nSo on average, per comment on each thread on the front page (hot), it's about 52 upvotes per comment. \n\nPolitics- \n\nTotal sum upvote per comment value of 347.35 across 24 threads on the front page of /politics (hot), which averaged out is:\n\n*average u/c thread= 14.47*\n\nSo on average, across the 24 threads on the front page of /politics, we have an average of ~14 upvotes per thread.\n\nI would love to have a mostly left echo chamber like The_donald for strict comparison, but sadly most other subreddits have extremely low activity (I think most left leaning people are in /politics). If anyone knows of one with decent sub numbers, let me know in the comments down below!\n\nJust for funsies, here is /funny's upvotes:comment ratio.\n\n932.98 upvotes per comment across 24 threads. Divided by that, we get an average of:  *38.87 u/c*\n\n\nYes, The_Donald has more people (I think it's bots 100%) agreeing than /funny does. Just thought this was interesting. Would love to here from any the_donald people, because it sounds like your subreddit is almost 100% echo chamber, or it's just a TON of lurkers, or it's most likely an overestimated # of actual subscribers when many are just bots upvoting threads.\n\n"

However I feel much less informed about important issues than ever.\n\nNearly everything I consume is related to:\n\n1. An event that occurred in the US and which US executive branch has no responsibility to involve with\n2. Trump's comments on #1\n3. How other people feel about #2\n4. More meta about how other people feel about #3 and #4\n5. Policies that people hope Trump or the legislative branch will adopt\n6. Policies that people hope Trump or the legislative branch will not adopt\n7. Lynch mobs relating to #1 through #7\n\nInstead, I endeavor to read about:\n\n* Changes in US policies and regulations initiated by the executive branch\n* Analysis of legislative bills which have passed subcommittee and are scheduled to vote in general assembly\n* Interviews with people that actually write the bills\n* Significant SCOTUS decisions and upcoming cases (e.g. upcoming Facebook biometric collection case)\n* Analysis of the above using a balanced review of available information and taking more effort than using Twitter for 5 minutes\n* Conspiracy theories and accusations of corruption, only if the author is presenting new information that was not previously available publicly\n\n**If you are also interested in these topics, please share the primary sources of information you are using to stay informed!**"

        "description": "As a thought experiment, what do you all think about this process of election:\n\n* The electoral college shall elect as President the candidate who receives the Majority of Electoral votes.\n* Should no candidate receive a Majority, then all candidates receiving the fewest votes shall be eliminated such that adding the total of the eliminated votes to the first remaining candidate produces a Majority.\n* Should no candidate receive a Majority, a new Election date shall be set by Congress to vote on these remaining candidates.\n\nPotentially eliminate the EC and default to a direct vote, as a variation.  Also, potentially use the direct vote counting as a State mechanism for local elections, although this is a State matter.\n\nI believe the above mechanism essentially avoids eliminating any candidate who *can* win, as even a candidate with 1.01% of the votes who is ahead of 49 other 1%-vote candidates would remain and, if receiving all of the votes for those eliminated candidates, would win 50.01% of the votes and would thus defeat *any other candidate*.  No eliminated candidate would, if receiving the votes of all eliminated candidates, breach the 50% mark.\n\nThere's a bug here where States have no immediately-obvious way to grind down their candidate list by repeated voting, thus a State can't refuse to cast an EC vote until it has a clear Majority popular vote in that state, because they can't eliminate and re-poll.  That's fixable either by letting States repeat the election each day for a week (strain on the voters) or by just ejecting the EC and counting the popular vote only.\n\nDropping the EC and giving the popular vote would probably produce the most majority-favored result.\n\nThe States can cut back their candidate lists on the way to the Presidential election by declaring voting on candidate ballot access for the Presidential election as a single Statewide election, not a Federal election, and restricting campaign spending and donations to $0 at the State level.  Thus the FEC allows you to have a Campaign Committee for the State-level election and take donations, *but* the state bars such donations to campaigns seeking ballot access votes for Presidential elections.  Your campaign for this is your Presidential campaign.\n\nImplementing the actual Presidential election changes requires replacing the 12th amendment, which requires ratification by 38 states at this time.  The Compact is the only limited way to evade the Constitutional setting.  I wonder if we should pass a Federal law echoing the 12th Amendment, and then propose that the States pass a broad Constitutional Amendment to allow Congress limited power to set the method by which the States may elect a new President.  That may be entirely too much Congressional power.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we could implement this by Mock Election, passing a law allowing Congress to declare a method to test the results of a new voting system.  The results of such would demonstrate to the people if they prefer this system and what the results would be.  Even if the results are not to their liking, they might perceive a system as more-fair and so prefer it regardless of the results."

        "num_comments": 11,
        "description": "Hillary Clinton has been shaped and sculpted and pressured and forced into boxes over decades of national political attention. She is the product of thousands of meetings and focus groups and opinion polls and strategy sessions. Many of the changes she has made to herself (clouding, probably, her true self and producing the phoniness everyone hates about her) are the result of America\u2019s profoundly sexist culture, especially when it comes to women in positions of power.\n\nWith the impending release of her book this week, everybody\u2019s talking about why Hillary lost. Of course she\u2019s reflective of a spinelessness among Democrats in the 21st century. No one\u2019s debating that. Of course she\u2019s blaming Bernie for her loss when any child looking at this chart understands what the bigger problem was. Of course she has cozied up to Wall Street and demonized black kids and taken some atrocious positions over the years. None of that is in dispute, but neither does it change the core tragedy at the heart of Hillary Clinton, Politician.\n\nJust look at her name \u2014 when Bill Clinton first became governor of Arkansas in 1978, she was Hillary Rodham. She was independent and strong, working to improve the health care of rural folks in the state. But many voters thought she was too uppity. She didn\u2019t act demure or shy, like most First Ladies. In 1980 Bill Clinton was defeated by Republican Frank D. White, in part because conservatives attacked Hillary. When Bill ran to reclaim the seat, Hillary started calling herself \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and occasionally \u201cMrs. Bill Clinton\u201d. He won his re-election bid in 1982.\n\nThus it has been for everything Hillary has ever done in the public spotlight. When she became First Lady of the nation, she was attacked for not baking enough cookies. She was attacked for working to improve health care instead of smiling for the cameras. She was attacked for speaking up about women\u2019s rights in Beijing. And nothing she ever did in response to her husband\u2019s constant sexual depravity has ever been good enough for The American People.\n\nThe American People are not always well-informed. They often vote with their guts, and their guts wear glasses thick with hostility toward powerful women. The American People often have mommy issues and male privilege and Queen Bee mindsets that make them hostile toward any woman trying to ascend ladders, especially those related to political power. So when someone like Hillary tries to relate to The American People, she can\u2019t simply act on instinct the way Donald Trump can. She has to do whatever she can to appease their bizarre expectations. Like Trump, she tried acting on instinct when she first entered politics. She was shot down with violent intensity. So she started adjusting her behavior, and she\u2019s never stopped.\n\nI don\u2019t love Hillary Clinton, and I don\u2019t even like her very much. She has made an ocean of compromises to further her legal, economic, and political futures. However, I need the world to acknowledge the unique kinds of pressures she has faced for decades, and start changing the way we discuss and critique women in the political sphere. They face particular kinds of scrutiny and prejudice, and no story of their rise or fall is complete without an appreciation of those factors.\n\nThat is all."

All he wants is revenge against Obama, who publicly humiliated him at the Washington Correspondent's Dinner in 2011.\n\nWake up, you media morons. Stop pretending that their must be some other reason that Trump acts in the insane manner he does.\n"

        "description": "I work in a pharmacy. While that doesn't make me an authority on this history of the medical and prescription drug system, I do follow drug prices and know about a lot of things that the average american may not be privy to. \n\nAnd it bothers me that there's something even single payer proponents aren't talking about (bernie, for all I like about him, he's AWFUL at explaining shit). Single payer doesn't just pay for american health care, it reduces the COST Of american health care. \n\nI just watched Jake tapper ask bernie why single payer failed in california and vermont, and the answer was simple buy somehow bernie failed to articulate it. \n\nThe reason why, is because NATIONAL single payer would remove public insurance nationwide, state level single payer does not. \n\nWhy does a drug that is manufactured at 3 cents per pill being sold for 1.20 per pill? Simple. Insurance companies. Listen, i'm not trying to pretend that medical care (both at the hospital level, and the prescription drug level) should be kept in the public domain entirely. I'm very aware that it has to be somewhat profit driven because otherwise there's no incentive for private drug companies to continue R&D. But in most markets, there's a reasonable profit margin. In prescription drugs, they charge sometimes 1000 times more than the drug costs to manufacture. \n\nAnd this is because the drug companies and hospitals have deals with private insurance. \n\nThere are some drugs we sell in the pharmacy, where using certain insurances reduces the cost of the medication. i need to make sure you read that right. I'm not saying the insurance paid TOWARDS the cost for the patient. No. Just using that insurance reduced the price. That insurance has a deal with that drug company that if they use that insurance, the actual drug maker reduces the price of the medication. \n\nThis is more prevalent than you think. While its only a short video and fails to adequately explain the ENTIRE situation, there's a great \"adam ruins everything\" that touches on why hospital wheelchairs cost 5-10 times more than they would at a retail level. \n\nDrug cost is an artificial problem. And drug insurance is the \"solution\" . \n\nListen, i'm not anti insurance. Home insurance, car insurance. They all do one thing: they stabilize loss. Instead of paying 10k dollars in flood damage, you pay into it every month and you're covered for the damage even if it exceeds what you paid into it. \n\nInsurance can be good. \n\nBut there's no shopping around hospitals like there is with finding a car part. You can't get in a car accident, and as they're carrying you away on a stretcher \"take me to the discount hospital on elm please\". \n\nEveryone wonders how you FUND single payer. Since americans pay at least 10 times on average what other nations pay on prescription drugs, how can we expect the government to pay for that? \n\nSimple, they WON'T be paying that. \n\nWhen you enable single payer, you remove private health insurance. There are some who want to keep private insurance too and do some sort of credit system. Nope, it doesn't work if the private insurances are allowed to exist. The whole point is that if there is no more private health insurance, there goes the negotiated inflated costs from medical and pharmaceutical companies. \n\nIt won't be overnight, and that IS a concern. For a time, prices likely won't fall immediately. \n\nBut in as few as a couple years, treatment costs will fall into reasonable territory. \n\nIn this single payer bill, we need to include laws about price gouging for drugs companies. \n\nMake drugs and sell at a profit. Thats ok, we're still a capitalist country. But they should held accountable by congress or other government bodies. \n\nMuch like you can't hike up water costs in anticipation of a hurricaine, drug companies who make cancer drugs shouldn't be allowed to charge more than X% above manufacturing costs. And if they lie about their costs, they go down for fraud. \n\nIts not about government health care. Its government health insurance. they are not the same thing. Single payer DOES work because it removes the negotiated inflated prices that the insurance companies created. "

Despite the evidence to the contrary, this is still something I believe in: an ideal that is important to me.\n\nFast-forward to now and I've become aware of forces that have hindered the greater-freedom of this nation's people. The distribution of power is unbalanced. Our economy puts too much favor on those who are already winning.\n\nWhat is the American dream? To grit your teeth and put your hands to work? To fight with hammer and nail to build your own path? Strife! That is the american dream! To prosper in fierce competition with your rivals! To know that growth is hard work and that it takes hard work to keep what you've built!\n\nBut there are those to whom these principles don't apply. They are above strife. They are above rivalries; meeting behind closed doors to enact policies which reduce the effort they have to expend from day to day. These people stand against the ideals of freedom; hoarding the means of growth for themselves, leaving the soil barren for those who need it most.\n\nOr maybe I'm naive. Maybe I'm asking for too much when I think that a nation should stand by its words. Home of the free? Land of the brave? Well, exercise your freedom to exercise bravery by putting your money where your mouth is and trying something new!\n\nFor too long has the balance of power - the means of influence - been out of favor of the people. Too long have these dynasties stood, supported by the back-bone of no back-bone at all; by those who hadn't the bravery to stand by this nation's principles.\n\nI'm not asking for a revolution but even if I was, our people are too divided to ever come together for a common cause. Divided and conquered, we were, and now I don't know what we can do to fix this mess; this mismanagement of trust and the belief that our nation couldn't be bested by a festering amalgamation from within.\n\nBut to clarify: my goal here isn't to just say that things aren't how they ought to be and whine in a puddle of tears. I'm just hoping that maybe my words will move someone to action: someone who knows what they're doing. Because to be honest, I simply don't know what to do. Some of us never knew and I think that might be a contributing factor.\n\nYours, a concerned citizen."

The recent hearing by the FCC and people commenting on how their representatives straight up ignored their input shows a disturbing trend. A Democracy straight up stops being a Democracy when those in power stop listening to the people.\n\nI propose an idea for a law to be passed: that neither the US military nor any other armed force on or in this nation's land, air, or water are allowed to use artillery or ordnance deployed from land, air, or water against its own populace.\n\nNow, common sense says this law is absurd. Of course, the US military wouldn't use artillery or airstrikes against its own people. But it's not about whether or not they would. It's about whether or  not those in power are willing to give the people a fighting chance if they thought a revolution should happen.\n\nIf they don't pass the law, then fuck 'em, they just asked us to start preparing for a potential war: to dismantle the system and rebuild it anew.\n\nIf they do pass the law, then we can wait. But, of course, if they were to continue their behavior pattern of not listening to us, we could forcefully remind them of why our constitution is written as it is.\n\nYours, a concerned citizen."

If you would feel my statements offending then just try to imagine yourself on the patriot's place and think how confirmed USA patriot would be offended in a similar situation. If you call me a \"Russian paid troll\" then it's your right. It's always easy to dismiss opinions on such pretext.*\n\nRussia haven't any strategy for Trump. Russian officials prepared for Hillary presidency. Well, because any rational analitics pointed to that. To be honest, this \"Trump is a Russian stooge\" looks like a crackpot conspiracy theory from the our point of view. If you replace \"reptiloid zionists\" with \"Russian KGB hackers\" then you would get a complete picture. It's what continuously perpetuated in mass media - an outright conspiracy theory.\n\nThe foremost reason for Russia officials to not do such things is an apparent fear of USA's wrath and rational reasoning. Do you really think Mr.Putin would voluntary make warlike actions against USA even if Russia army is in much better condition than in the past? Russia isn't North Korea for your information! Russian officials still hope this apparent madness would end and more or less civilized foreign relations would be started. Really, Russian officials say it on the every corner and Russian foreign affairs ministry have lots of statements about apparent madness in Russia-USA relations.\n\nFrom our perspective USA politics is full of lobbyist groups and outright swindlers like Bill Browder who fool people around. They invoked zombie cold-war era \"Russian threat\" hysteria and it's all. It's unimaginable how such swindlers as Bill Browder was able to influence USA politics and even push laws in their favor in full disregard to quickly deteriorating Russia-USA relations because of those laws! That's who really influence USA politics. Browder's inspired laws was a major factor that ruined Russia-USA relations in the past and then things just started to get worse every year. And when Russia became a token in the USA elections it started to look like the outright bufoonery (but still very dangerous bufoonery) and the total collapse of reason.\n\nNobody here (in Russia) wants a war with USA nor EU. Everybody wants a trade and partnership on the fair terms. It's a common opinion here with the exclusion of the marginal isolationist groups.\n\nJust think about one wise thing. **If you falsely count someone as enemy and behave as if he's an enemy then you just making him an enemy because of your own actions and his simple task to protect himself.**\n\nThat's all about subject. \n"

I honestly believe it would be good for the nation if he were to voluntarily resign, but I do not imagine Donald Trump ever taking that option, even if he was advised by everyone in our government to do so.  As such I honestly will not be surprised if one or the other happens before this term is up (as a matter of an opinion, only)."

        "description": "This is a serious question. All the time I see a gun buyback thrown as a solution with references to Australia\u2019s success. How would this get funded though? A quick google search says there are about 270 to 310 million guns in the United States. Even if the buyback was $1 which isn\u2019t enough, we would need to fund at least $270 million. Guns are expensive and without offering at least $100, I just can\u2019t see this being enough incentive for people to exchange their firearms. Even at $100, buying back the low estimate of firearms, that\u2019s a cost of $27000000000, or $27 billion. This seems like an absurd burden on the taxpayers, and that\u2019s just low end estimates with low costs and low weapon count. How would this solution be paid for? I just can\u2019t wrap my head around the logistics of how this would work, that\u2019s almost $100 per citizen when you consider we almost have as much guns as we do people. People would have to pay as much to support the buyback as they would make from the buyback. This just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. "

        "description": "\nOpinions\nA history of Donald Trump\u2019s business dealings in Russia\nBy David Ignatius Opinion writer November 2\n\nPresident Trump takes questions from reporters before boarding Marine One (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 An ice-blue 14-story office tower called Ducat Place III is the building that President Trump might have constructed here, with help from a business friend named Howard Lorber who came with him to scout the market in 1996. But like so many other Trump adventures in Russia, this one proved a tantalizing but futile dead end.\n\nTrump is angrily dismissive when questions are raised about his Russian contacts. He calls the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and media reports about his Russia connections \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cfabrication.\u201d He tweeted in January, shortly before his inauguration: \u201cI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA \u2014 NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201d\n\nAs the Mueller investigation accelerated this week with the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the plea deal reached with former campaign foreign-policy aide George Papadopoulos, the context of the probe becomes newly important. How did Trump accumulate his network of Russian business contacts in the years before the 2016 campaign? What\u2019s the prehistory of Trump and Russia?\n\nRead These Comments\n\nThe best conversations on The Washington Post\n\nThe Mueller investigation is still in its opening round, and it\u2019s far too early to make any judgments about Trump\u2019s own actions. A member of Trump\u2019s inner circle told me that he advised the president recently, \u201cThis is the most innocent you\u2019ve ever been of any allegation.\u201d But to reach a judgment, you first must understand the history of Trump\u2019s fascination, bordering on obsession, with Russian business deals.\n\nThe simple truth is that Trump has been hungry for Russia projects for more than three decades. He has repeatedly touted plans for a Moscow mega-development and has courted a steady stream of investors from the former Soviet Union for ventures in New York, South Florida and other locations. Trump has enjoyed playing the \u201cbig guy\u201d in Moscow. As he bragged to a New York real-estate publication after a November 2013 dinner with prominent business leaders: \u201cThe Russian market is attracted to me.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Russia connections helped sow the seeds of Mueller\u2019s investigation. The best example is the now-famous June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower organized by Donald Trump Jr. with Russians who had links with the Kremlin. Mueller is investigating whether that meeting was part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election. But any potential criminal issues aside, the gathering embodied the Trump family\u2019s 30-year involvement with wealthy tycoons from the former Soviet Union.\n\nWhat follows is an attempt to explain Trump\u2019s encounter with Russia as a narrative. Most of the details have surfaced before, but it has been hard to see the story whole, as a business saga. With Russia, as with so many other aspects of Trump\u2019s business and political life, he has been more pitchman than builder. What\u2019s clear, reviewing the facts, is that Trump\u2019s claim he had \u201cnothing to do with Russia\u201d over the years is nonsense.\n3:06\nInside the plan to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow\n\nThe Washington Post's Carol Leonnig and Tom Hamburger explain the Trump Organization's efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. (Jenny Starrs, Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump\u2019s business interest in Russia began in 1986. The flashy young tycoon met Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin at a luncheon and, as he recounted in his 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d the two began \u201ctalking about building a large luxury hotel across the street from the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nWith Dubinin\u2019s encouragement, Trump flew to Moscow in July 1987 with his Czech-born first wife, Ivana, to check out potential sites. Trump wrote in his book: \u201cIt was an extraordinary experience. .\u2009.\u2009. We stayed in Lenin\u2019s suite at the National Hotel, and I was impressed with the ambition of the Soviet officials to make a deal.\u201d\n\nBut Trump was preoccupied with other business projects in the late 1980s, including buying an airline and the Plaza Hotel (which he lost after bankruptcies in 1991 and 1992, respectively), and the Russia hotel deal stalled.\n\nTrump explored the Russian market again in 1996, with help from his friend Lorber, who is chief executive of Vector Group, a holding company that back then owned a Russian cigarette company and now owns Douglas Elliman Realty, one of the leading brokerage firms for super-rich Russians seeking property in the United States.\n\nLorber is a fascinating, little-noted member of Trump\u2019s inner circle. Trump described him last year as one of his two closest friends; they\u2019ve helped each other\u2019s children in business, and Lorber introduced Trump to David Friedman, who is now U.S. ambassador to Israel; Friedman\u2019s former partner, Marc Kasowitz, became Trump\u2019s lawyer. Lorber even made a cameo appearance in a 2005 episode of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nThe Trump-Lorber foray in Moscow began with Lorber\u2019s business partner (and close Trump friend) Bennett LeBow, who had acquired the Liggett tobacco company in 1986. One subsidiary, called Liggett-Ducat, marketed the company\u2019s cigarettes in Russia. And Liggett-Ducat had a 98-year lease on a prime development site in central Moscow.\n\nWith his usual panache, Trump announced plans for a $250 million investment that would include a \u201cTrump International\u201d complex on the Liggett-Ducat site at a November 1996 news conference in Moscow. \u201cWe have an understanding we will be doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump bragged about his plans in January 1997, when he and Lorber met visiting Russian politician Aleksandr Lebed in New York. A 1997 New Yorker profile of Trump captured their exchange and showed the breadth of Trump\u2019s hopes for Moscow investment and business connections.\n\n\u201cWe are actually looking at something in Moscow right now, and it would be skyscrapers and hotels, not casinos. Only quality stuff. .\u2009.\u2009. And we\u2019re working with the local government, the mayor of Moscow, and the mayor\u2019s people. So far, they\u2019ve been very responsive. .\u2009.\u2009. I always go into the center.\u201d\n\nThe Moscow mayor Trump cultivated was Yuri Luzhkov. John Beyrle, then U.S. ambassador to Russia, offered this blunt summary of Luzhkov\u2019s approach in a 2010 cable to Washington: \u201cCorruption in Moscow remains pervasive with Mayor Luzhkov at the top of the pyramid. Luzhkov oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behavior.\u201d Beyrle\u2019s cable was published by WikiLeaks.\n\nWhatever inside track Trump thought he had with Luzhkov in 1996, the deal petered out. Trump\u2019s business troubles were mounting at home, and financing may not have been available. Handsome towers were built at sites called Ducat Place II and III, but not by Trump.\n\nThe Trump International Beach Resort in Sunny Isles. (Angel Valentin/for The Washington Post)\n\nThe Russian moneymaker for Trump in the 2000s turned out, instead, to be investment in U.S. properties bearing his name. Russians were eager to move their capital into fancy condo apartments in New York and Florida. Here, again, his friend Lorber was well connected.\n\nLorber\u2019s real-estate firm Douglas Elliman, hoping to profit from the Russian market, hired a string of Russian-speaking agents who could help rich clients find high-end properties.\n\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t target the Russian billionaires, then you shouldn\u2019t be in the business,\u201d said Dolly Lenz, a former Douglas Elliman broker, in a 2008 article in the New York Observer. Lenz told USA Today last year that she had sold about 65 apartments in Manhattan\u2019s Trump World Tower to Russian buyers. \u201cThey all wanted to meet Donald,\u201d she said.\n\nOne magnet for Russian money was a private resort called Fisher Island in Biscayne Bay, just off Miami. Lorber has been a director of the Oceanside at Fisher Island Condominium Association since 2000 and is currently a director of the Fisher Island Club.\n\nAmong Fisher Island\u2019s many Soviet-born property owners have been Aras Agalarov, a Russian-Azerbaijani magnate who sponsored Trump\u2019s Miss Universe 2013 pageant and whose pop-singer son Emin organized the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born former adviser to Trump who worked with the Bayrock Group that helped develop the Trump SoHo project in New York.\n\n(Lorber declined to comment through Vector\u2019s public-affairs consultant, Emily Claffey of Sard Verbinnen & Co.)\n\nTrump\u2019s business deals in South Florida illustrated his blend of panache and caution, his hunger for Russian cash and his ability to skirt disaster. He sold his name to condo projects in an area called Sunny Isles Beach, helped pump up the market there and walked away unscathed when it crashed.\n\n\u201cThe city has earned the nickname \u2018Little Russia\u2019 for its high percentage of Russian-speaking residents,\u201d notes the Douglas Elliman website, pitching high-rises there to prospective buyers. The Miami Herald reported that according to U.S. Census data, nine percent of Sunny Isles Beach households have Russian origins, the largest percentage of Russians in Miami-Dade County.\n\nSunny Isles is a case study in how Trump does business. It was once a decidedly un-chic beachfront north of Miami, \u201ca place where your uncle who lives on Social Security would go on vacation,\u201d says Peter Zalewski, a Florida real-estate consultant. But after it incorporated as a separate jurisdiction within Miami-Dade County, with business-friendly local managers, it became a magnet for investment \u2014 and was rebranded as \u201cFlorida\u2019s Riviera.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s name graces a string of sleek buildings along this strip of coast. First was the Trump International Beach Resort, a complex completed in 2004. Then came Trump Palace in 2006; Trump Towers I, II and III, built in 2007, 2008 and 2009; and Trump Royale in 2008. But Trump\u2019s developer friends plunged into Sunny Isles at the wrong time. According to a 2010 article at SouthFloridaCondos.blogspot.com, unit prices at the three Trump Towers buildings dropped nearly 40 percent from the 2005 pre sales period. As the market crashed, the construction loan for Trump Towers had to be restructured. Trump Hollywood, another glitzy project further north, was driven into foreclosure in 2010.\n\nTrump deftly distanced himself from the developers\u2019 troubles, telling the Sun-Sentinel that he questioned their \u201ctiming.\u201d But the condo market gradually improved, thanks in part to Russian buyers. A Reuters investigation found that 63 people with Russian addresses or passports have purchased $98.4 million of property in Trump-branded condos in South Florida.\n\nTrump also had a personal infusion of Russian cash in the liquidity-starved 2008 market. That year he sold for a handsome $95 million a Palm Beach waterfront mansion he bought at auction in 2004 for just $41.35 million \u2014 more than doubling his money at a time when much of the South Florida market was underwater. The buyer was Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev.\n\nDezer Development, the real-estate company that helped attach Trump\u2019s name to six projects in Sunny Isles Beach, saw Trump\u2019s presidential campaign as a promotion opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s a free press release,\u201d Gil Dezer told Bloomberg News in August 2016.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. arrives at Trump Tower in New York City. (Stephanie Keith/Reuters)\n\nHelping build the Trump-Russia pipeline in the fragile 2008 market was Donald Trump Jr. He was a keynote speaker at the June 2008 Russian Real Estate Summit in Moscow, where he touted the Trump Organization\u2019s plans to build condos and hotels in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sochi. At a New York real-estate conference in September 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business.\n\n\u201cIn terms of high-end product influx into the U.S., Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. .\u2009.\u2009. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia,\u201d said the young Trump, according to a Sept. 15, 2008, article about the conference. He said he had made a half-dozen trips to Russia during the previous 18 months.\n\nA project that had significant financing from former Soviet Union investors was Trump SoHo, a 46-story condo-hotel project in Lower Manhattan that opened in September 2007. One development partner was the Sapir Organization, founded by Tamir Sapir from Georgia. Another partner was Bayrock, founded by Tevfik Arif, a Kazakh-born businessman who brought in Sater. As has been widely reported, Sater went to prison in 1993 after stabbing a man, and later became an FBI informant.\n\nFor the elder Trump, these ex-Soviet investors were important assets for the future. He said in a deposition in a Trump SoHo lawsuit: \u201cBayrock knew the people, knew the investors. .\u2009.\u2009. And this was going to be Trump International Hotel and Tower Moscow, Kiev, Istanbul, etc., Poland, Warsaw.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. continued traveling to Russia and Eastern Europe, prospecting for business. He was interviewed in May 2012 before giving a speech to a real-estate conference in Riga, Latvia. His comments, captured on YouTube, explain why the Trump Organization saw the former Eastern Bloc as crucial: \u201cIt\u2019s a part of the world that now you\u2019re starting to see some amazing architecture, some incredible real estate, you\u2019re seeing a real big boom in wealth. .\u2009.\u2009. We have something that\u2019s very relevant in that sector.\u201d\n\nRussian businessman Aras Agalarov, Miss Universe 2013 Gabriela Isler and Donald Trumpat the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, Russia. (Irina Bujor/AP)\n\nThe apex of Trump\u2019s personal fascination with Russia may have been 2013, when he brought the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow and talked, yet again, of building a \u201cTrump Tower\u201d there. His business partner in the pageant was Aras Agalarov, president of Crocus Group, a shopping-mall developer. Forbes magazine notes that he has been called \u201cthe Trump of Russia\u201d because of his glitzy personal marketing.\n\nTrump and Agalarov formed an ebullient partnership over a dinner in Las Vegas on June 15, 2013, captured on the Internet. As Trump began hyping the pageant, he even tried to draw in Russia\u2019s president himself, tweeting on June 18, 2013: \u201cDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow \u2014 if so, will he become my new best friend?\u201d\n\nThe Miss Universe red carpet was rolled out Nov. 9, 2013. Emin Agalarov sang a song, and Miss Venezuela was crowned the winner. A story published that day by RT touted Trump\u2019s latest business plans for Russia, quoting him: \u201cI have plans for the establishment of business in Russia. Now, I am in talks with several Russian companies to establish this skyscraper.\u201d Aras Agalarov was quoted saying he was participating in talks to be Trump\u2019s partner in the project.\n\nAgalarov hosted a dinner for Trump at the Moscow branch of Nobu, which he owned. The co-host was Herman Gref, the chief executive of Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest bank, and a close adviser of President Vladimir Putin. An ebullient Trump saluted Agalarov in a Nov. 11 tweet: \u201cI had a great weekend with you and your family. You have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next.\u201d\n\nThe Trump-Agalarov contacts continued. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka visited Moscow in February 2014 and toured Crocus City Hall. Emin Agalarov performed at a golf tournament the next month at the Trump National Doral, near the family property at Fisher Island. Like so many seemingly imminent Trump-Moscow deals over the years, the skyscraper plan stalled.\n4:17\nWhat we know about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting\n\nHere's what we know so far about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer during his father's presidential campaign in June 2016. (Video: Elyse Samuels, Jenny Starrs/Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAnd then, finally, came an event that Mueller is said to have examined carefully \u2014 the meeting in June 2016 where Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya met with Trump\u2019s inner circle. It helps to recall the long history of Trump\u2019s business dealings with Russia when you read this June 3, 2016, email to Trump Jr. from Rob Goldstone, the publicist for Emin Agalarov:\n\n\u201cEmin just called me to contact you with something very interesting. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Trump \u2014 helped along by Aras and Emin.\u201d\n\nTo which Trump Jr. answered: \u201cI love it.\u201d The meeting took place on June 9 with, among others, Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Manafort and Veselnitskaya, a lawyer with links to the Kremlin. Veselnitskaya says her real goal was to lobby the Trump team to oppose the Magnitsky Act, which she described in a May 31, 2016, memo as \u201cthe beginning of a new round of the Cold War,\u201d echoing Putin\u2019s line.\n\nAs the new president was taking office, the Trump brand sparkled brighter than ever for Russians. The Miami Herald reported on Jan. 30 that in November 2016, Russians topped the list of foreigners looking for homes in the Miami area.\n\nOren Alexander, one of the top brokers at Douglas Elliman, explained the post-election trend to the Herald: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Russian buyers think America is a good place to be again.\u201d Among the places that attracted Russian purchasers, he said, were Sunny Isles Beach and Fisher Island.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation might tell us whether any of these Trump-Russian business connections improperly melded into the 2016 campaign. But at the core of Trump\u2019s interaction with his Russian friends is an insight they have shared ever since Soviet days: Politics may be transitory, but real estate is forever.\n\nTwitter: @IgnatiusPost\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\n"

I haven't found any of his statements that are blatantly wrong. \n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/personalities/bernie-s/\n\nBernie Sanders's file\n\nOn Politifact score card, he fares much better than other politicians.

        "description": "I hate it here. I hate how we don't have universal healthcare. Breaking Bad would have ended on its first episode if it took place in Canada, he wouldn't have to sell meth and undergo a dangerous endeavour just to make things better. Oh, and speaking of \u201cendeavour\u201d, I hate how the U.S. intentionally omits the \u201cu\u201d from words like odour and behaviour, leaving us open to criticism from Brits and others, fcking cnts (both the Brits and the nited states of America). I also don't like how it took us a whole decade just to get chips in our credit/debit cards which could have prevented fraud years ago, and even now it's taking a long-ass time to implement chip technology in our card readers and even in the ones that do, we still use chip-and-signature instead of chip-and-pin because banks believe we're too dumb to remember a 4-digit code, like the ones we already use to unlock our cell phones dozens of times a day. What the hell. Speaking of being dumb, I hate how dumb and undereducated some of us are. It really doesn't make us look good as a country. In fact I hate everyone here, our attitude and pretentiousness and other stuff. I hate how we tend to be ignorant of other happenings in the world, other countries have people and their problems too. And speaking of being behind, I hate how we're behind in education, we're 27th in the entire world, and we're a first-world country. I wish we could be smart like China and South Korea and Singapore, where we learn more stuff at a younger age. I also hate how a lot of students here tend to just not think very highly of school and think they can just do whatever they want in school. I purposefully ignore people like that because they're not the ones who are going to contribute to society in a big way, and as I've already stated, I don't like undereducated people. I also don't understand the national debt. $20 trillion we owe, fucking great job America, clap clap. \u201cohh every country is in debt\u201d shut up, they're not to the magnitude of us. And what do we do with our money? Oh what better than to splurge on the military, and then propose tax cuts to the wealthy and budget cuts to healthcare, space exploration, education, etc. Why don't we STOP? Because the U.S. is a fucking dumbshit. I also don't like how we continue to use an archaic measuring system that the rest of the world has long since abandoned. The metric system is SO MUCH EASIER. Yet companies still won't make the switch because it'll cost them a little bit of their oh-so-precious money. Again, I hate how we're behind on EVERYTHING. Speaking of which, I hate how capitalism here is just off the fucking rails. Companies storing their money in offshore bank accounts to avoid tax and them just trying to squeeze every last penny out of the average working-class citizen. And money spent on things other than those that need urgent addressing. The most basic of needs end up turning into ways companies can just get a little more money and it makes me sick. For example, epi-pens used to cost $20-30 apiece, now they're up to $200-300. People fucking need those, you want them to die and not be able to get anymore money out of them ever again? Fuck you. One of the most outrageous things to me (and a lot of other people living here), our president. I hate everyone who voted for him, you're all a bunch of ignorant boneheads. Your lack of education and better understanding made you think that the bullshit that this guy was spewing was reason to vote for him, now he's in office and he's screwing this country over and now we all have to suffer for it. If you've voted for him then fuck you and go fuck yourself, if you want to block me then go ahead, good riddance to you.\n\nHonestly my brain is fried right now, and I could come up with more things if I wanted to but can't, so I'm gonna end here.\n\nHonestly, I hate it here, and I don't have to suffer under these things anymore. But I kinda have to since I'm 15, and I really just want to get the hell out of here. But I can't, and I don't know what to do. I really don't want to have to live under these things anymore. I want to be out of here.\n\nEven IF we stay here and try to change things, it won't change the fact that we were still late catching up to the rest of the developed world, and it doesn't look good on the country that's expected to be ahead of everyone else. And we don't bother to change things since there are so many safeguards that prevent us from doing anything so it's kinda hopeless.\n\nSo what can I do? I'm 15 and I really just want to be the hell out of here. But I can\u2019t since I have no job experience and am still a minor, so there's nothing I can do, and I really don't want to live in the United States anymore.\n\n\"Ohh stop complaining there are people who have it worse than you America is the greatest country in the world Trump did nothing wrong and bla bla bla high-pitched retarded & patriotic screeching AMERICAAA\"    \nKill yourself my dude."

        "description": "Washington's throwing so much crazy shit our way, it's hard to know what to even react to.\n\nEveryone's preoccupied with with net neutrality. White supremacists and misogynists are being openly supported. Gun laws are being weakened just _months_ after the worst mass shooting in our country. Taxes are being reduced for the wealthy under the guise of creating jobs, even though unemployment's at the lowest it's been in years.\n\nI'm a former political apathist who's decided that _enough is enough_. I [made a website](http://redcranebluecrane.com) over the past week to address some of the issues I've found with information available on the web:\n\n* Concise articles that don't focus on more than a couple issues.\n* Proper citations on articles.\n* Opinion pieces clearly marked as such.\n* An action item at the end of each article, with an easy way to contact your representatives.\n\nI'm using [Google's Civic API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/) to pull the representative info, so it only grabs the phone and twitter of the representative (it's missing the email). At first, I was bothered by the fact that it's not pulling their email, but I think this is actually a good thing. Calling your representative is _way_ more effective than an email, and tweets have more visibility.\n\nI want to keep the site as non-partisan as possible, but it's flat-out impossible to not be with certain issues, and it's becoming increasingly difficult with the rest.\n\nSo far, I've written:\n\n* [An article on why \"gun control\" should change its focus](http://redcranebluecrane.com/article/advocate-gun-safety-and-responsibility/)\n* [An article trying to bring awareness on how extreme gerrymandering is becoming](http://redcranebluecrane.com/article/the-real-voter-fraud-in-america/)\n* And [an opinion piece on why we should contact Congress and stop the tax cuts](http://redcranebluecrane.com/opinion/the-black-friday-no-one-wanted/) (it's not too late!)\n\nI feel most strongly about the tax cuts. If you think about it, all the noise about net neutrality is happening because it restricts free speech, and it'll cost us money. The tax cuts will cost us _more_ money in the long run, and its existence itself is an affront to our free speech. Legislation that prioritizes corporations over voters is becoming increasingly bold, and sets a precedence that gives the wealthy a stronger voice than the rest of us.\n\nI hope you all find this helpful. Any suggestions / comments would be very appreciated!"

        "description": "Thank you for contacting me with your support for the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open Internet Order, commonly known as net neutrality. It is an honor to serve the people of Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, and I appreciate your thoughts on this important matter. \n\nIn February 2015, the FCC adopted the Open Internet Order, which is a set of regulations prohibiting broadband Internet access service (BIAS) providers from blocking access to certain categories of legal Internet content, impairing Internet traffic based on content, or receiving compensation for prioritizing particular online traffic. Net neutrality is based on the idea that all Internet content should be treated equally, meaning no matter how much a BIAS provider invests in its operations, it must treat all content identically. The FCC sought to achieve this by reclassifying broadband providers as a public utility, which subjects them to the same strict regulations that govern telephone networks - regulations which were developed in the 1930's in response to the Bell Telephone Company's monopoly.\n\nFor the 20 years prior to the FCC's implementation of the Open Internet Order, broadband providers invested over $1 trillion in digital networks, which represents roughly one quarter of the world's investments in communications infrastructure. Since the FCC's reclassification, broadband providers have seen investments drop by 5% or more on average, which ultimately deters expansion into rural communities like those in the First District. In an effort to preserve the legitimate aims of net neutrality, while also remedying the Open Internet Order's flawed approach, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has announced his intentions to remove BIAS providers' classification as public utilities. Instead, the FCC will return to a \"light-touch\" regulatory framework which rewards natural adaptation and allowed the Internet to grow and innovate free of government interference for over 20 years.\n\nPromoting an Internet ecosystem that encourages innovation, protects consumer privacy, and expands the marketplace, is a goal we can all agree to pursue. However, there is no single path to achieve this end, and the FCC's misguided adoption of the Open Internet Order disregards the free market's decades-long success in creating the Internet we enjoy today. Contrary to the opinions of some, the Internet will not become a lawless Wild West where big business and special interests control the levers of power. Instead, by returning the Internet to the free market and allowing it to develop naturally, we will enjoy the same outcomes and success that have made this technology inseparable from our daily lives. I am committed to ensuring that responsible safeguards are in place so the Internet we enjoy today is not compromised, and I will certainly keep your thoughts in mind should any legislation dealing with net neutrality come before me for a vote.\n\nAgain, thank you for contacting me to share your support for the Open Internet Order. It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives, and I am here to help in any way possible.  Please do not hesitate to call if I may ever be of service. You can also visit my website at http://bergman.house.gov to learn more about the many services with which my office is happy to assist. I look forward to hearing from you again soon.\n\nKind regards, \n(signed)\nJack Bergman\nMember of Congress"

( Recall that [Strange was appointed by the Alabama governor Robert Bentley](http://yellowhammernews.com/politics-2/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-luther-stranges-senate-appointment-lhuff/) to fill Jeff Sessions' Senate seat when Sessions was made US Attorney General). \n\nSo apparently the voice of the people is only heard selectively by McConnell, when doing so would support an outcome he favors.

I'm talking about a falling out of Southern support for the Democrats, and the subsequent \"swooping in\" of the Republicans. My understanding is this had to do with the Civil Rights Movement. I'd like to know what changed, why, who were the players, who was against it, etc.\n\nCan anyone recommend a good book that goes into this period? I'm aware that I've probably HUGELY oversimplified things... but hey, that's why I'm asking to learn more.\n\nI should also add that because I'm not American, I don't have a dog in the fight. I don't care about reading a book that's about why Republicans were wrong/right or why Democrats were wrong/right... I'm just interested to learn about it as an unbiased outsider.\n\nThanks everyone, I really appreciate it."

        "description": "Hi everyone. Welcome to 2017. \n\nWe've made some new changes to the sub, in the hopes that it will attract more subscribers.\n\nFirst off, we've added a new stylesheet, based off the Clearshift theme. Please let us know if you run into any problems with layout. Hope you like it. We also removed user flair for a couple reasons, one is that I didn't like it, and it tended to create unnecessary barriers to conversation, and led to pre-judgement. Also, it didn't fit into the aesthetics of the stylesheet.\n\nWe've also added a couple new rules. They are listed over there ---> in the sidebar. Take a look at them please.\n\nThe biggest change is that we will no longer tolerate accusations of being a \"shill\" or \"CTR\" or anything similar. That is used as a means to silence and shame other users, and violates rule #2 about being respectful. If you message the moderators with some baseless claim about our mods being shills, you will be met with a ban. Don't waste our time.\n\nIf you can't play nice and have meaningful discussion, you will be asked to leave.\n\nWe are also going to be cracking down on \"fake news\", which are sources that have no credibility, and are obviously biased. You can help us by reporting links that you believe are \"fake news\". Please only link to reputable sources, preferably sources that stick to the facts, with very little \"opinion\" or \"editorial leeway\" added. "

        "description": "(x-post /r/RadicalFeminism)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way, baby,\u201d crooned the old Virginia Slims commercials on TV in the late 1960s, and the bourgeois media has picked up the tune again on this, the fiftieth anniversary of the Pill (no further definition necessary\u2014everyone knows you are talking about s-e-x). And everyone knows the Pill is all about sex. When in 1975 Loretta Lynn sang, \u201cI\u2019m tearin\u2019 down your brooder house \u2019cause now I\u2019ve got the pill,\u201d the hearts of millions of women across America beat in time to the rhythm of her song, which dozens of radio stations tried to censor\u2014until it made the hit charts.\n\nThe Pill was the first reliable contraceptive that gave women control over their own reproduction. This tremendous medical advance enabled women to separate sexual enjoyment from fear of pregnancy, freeing them from the now excessive fertility with which evolution has endowed our species. But birth control and abortion remain restricted throughout the capitalist world by the state, by the institution of the family, and by organized religion, which all serve to enforce women\u2019s oppression. As long as the capitalist order exists, the benefits of science will be limited by the exploitation and oppression of this class system. Marxists look forward to the day when science can be \u201capplied with full understanding to all the fields of human activity,\u201d to quote the words of German socialist leader August Bebel, whose 1879 work Woman and Socialism was one of the first major Marxist works on the woman question.\n\nLeon Trotsky, co-leader with V.I. Lenin of the 1917 October Revolution, underlined that birth control and abortion are among woman\u2019s \u201cmost important civil, political and cultural rights\u201d (The Revolution Betrayed [1936]). We fight for women\u2019s liberation through socialist revolution. We call for free abortion on demand as part of free, quality health care for all and for free, 24-hour childcare to address the deep class and racial oppression of poor and minority women. The wealthy will always get their medical care, including their abortions, while myriad anti-abortion laws and restrictions on birth control target young, working-class and poor women, who can\u2019t afford quality health care, childcare and housing.\n\nAt the time of its first release by the pharmaceutical company Searle, big predictions were made about the effect that the Pill would have on society. Moral bigots wailed that it would promote female promiscuity and the decline of religion and the patriarchal family, while birth control advocates believed it would save the family, create happy marriages and end the world population explosion. The Pill was even hailed as the solution to the \u201cRed Menace.\u201d In her book America and the Pill: A History of Promise, Peril, and Liberation (Basic Books, 2010), historian Elaine May speaks of how some Cold Warriors believed that the Pill \u201cwould alleviate the conditions of poverty and unrest that might lead developing nations to embrace communism, and instead promote the growth of markets for consumer goods and the embrace of capitalism.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the \u201csexual revolution\u201d that is often credited to the Pill was the result, in one way or another, of the convulsive social struggles of the civil rights movement, which broke the back of Jim Crow segregation in the South, and of opposition to U.S. imperialism\u2019s war against the Vietnamese Revolution. The major social upheavals of the 1960s that broke up the reactionary Cold War consensus also led to substantial advances in access to higher education and professional jobs for women. At the same time, the civil rights movement could not eradicate the race-color caste oppression of black people, which is the bedrock of American capitalism, just as the institution of the family, the main source of women\u2019s oppression in capitalist society, is a bulwark of the bourgeois order.\n\nAbortion Rights Under Attack\n\nWhile U.S. bourgeois pundits celebrate the reproductive freedom that the Pill has given women, it is striking that most do not mention the precipitous decline in women\u2019s access to abortion. The assault on women\u2019s right to abortion continues unabated in the courts and halls of government, especially on the state level. As of June, some 370 bills to restrict abortion rights had been introduced this year alone in state legislatures across the country, and many have already passed. These range from Oklahoma\u2019s cruel requirement that a doctor show the woman an ultrasound of the fetus, to Nebraska\u2019s ban on all abortions after 20 weeks based on the claim that the fetus can feel pain. Perhaps the most barbarous is Utah\u2019s new law. Passed after a desperate 17-year-old paid a man $150 to beat her in an effort to induce a miscarriage, the law now allows homicide charges against women in similar cases! Meanwhile, the lies that abortion causes depression and breast cancer continue to circulate, and some recent polls show that for the first time more Americans call themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d than \u201cpro-choice.\u201d\n\nThe arsenal of legal measures on the federal as well as the state level has already made abortion virtually inaccessible to a large number of women. Thirty-eight states prohibit abortions after a specified point in pregnancy. Fully 35 states require one or both parents of women under 18 to be notified and/or consent to an abortion. Some 87 percent of U.S. counties and 31 percent of metropolitan areas have no abortion services.\n\nIn May 2009, the \u201cpro-life\u201d war on women claimed yet another life. Dr. George Tiller\u2014one of only three doctors whose clinics provide late-term abortions in the United States\u2014was assassinated while attending his church in Wichita, Kansas, by a right-wing anti-abortion bigot. Tiller, a main target of the anti-woman God squad for decades, was the eighth person murdered in this anti-abortion, \u201cfamily values\u201d onslaught since 1993. In an article titled \u201cThe New Abortion Providers,\u201d the New York Times (18 July) details the long decline in the number of doctors trained in performing abortions and tells the story of young doctors in groups like Medical Students for Choice fighting to make abortion part of a doctor\u2019s regular practice. Abortion is a medical procedure, now one of the safest in the world, that does not need to be carried out in isolated clinics, where doctors and their families, friends and co-workers can easily be subjected to harassment, violence and death by anti-abortion fanatics.\n\nEver since the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973, the basic democratic right of legal abortion has been under attack. The war on abortion rights has become a spearhead for social and political reaction because at its heart lies the question of legal and social equality for women. Providing women with some control over whether or not to have children, abortion is viewed as a threat to the institution of the family.\n\nAccess to contraception, too, is limited by cost and lack of basic information, while \u201cconscience clauses\u201d allow pharmacies to refuse to fill prescriptions for birth control and Plan B, the \u201cmorning-after\u201d pill. To all this can be added anti-woman moralizing, which rants that a girl shouldn\u2019t want to have sex. The argument goes that while any unwed mother is a bad girl, if she can claim she got carried away, maybe the sin is not quite as great (as long as she doesn\u2019t have an abortion). But having birth control implies premeditation. Precisely! In the words of the late comedian George Carlin, \u201cNot every ejaculation deserves a name.\u201d\n\nToday sex education in schools is increasingly under attack, while abstinence remains the focus of government-funded programs like the State Personal Responsibility Education Program, established by Barack Obama\u2019s recent health care \u201creform\u201d act. Abortion clinics are overwhelmingly outnumbered by \u201cpregnancy crisis centers\u201d\u2014fake clinics set up by anti-abortion groups with the purpose of subjecting pregnant women to anti-abortion propaganda and otherwise pressuring them to carry the fetus to term. According to the Nation, some 4,000 of these centers have received over $60 million in federal abstinence and marriage-promotion funds. As a result of the ignorance and miseducation produced by this tangle of social reaction, almost half of pregnancies in the U.S. every year are unplanned, according to the most recent government survey.\n\nWhile U.S. newspapers headline \u201cThe Pill: Making Motherhood Better for 50 Years\u201d (Washington Post, 9 May), the masses of working-class, minority and poor women have missed the celebration. The Great Recession rages on; union-busting is destroying what good union jobs remain; homes are in foreclosure; millions of working people cannot get jobs and their children cannot get a decent education or affordable health care. Except for the women at the very top of society, where the rich are certainly getting richer, the decades-long assault on the working class and the poor has more than canceled out the important improvements in women\u2019s legal status over the last 50 years.\n\nIn times of substantial class and social struggle, the capitalist class may be forced to cede some reforms. But as long as the capitalist order remains, the ruling class will seek to overturn these gains, as it is now doing, when such struggles are at an ebb. As revolutionary communists, we defend every gain that\u2019s been won for the exploited and oppressed, such as the gains wrested during the hard struggles of the civil rights movement. But these reforms have a fundamentally token quality to them because they leave untouched the capitalist system. The source of black oppression and anti-woman bigotry is not the particular capitalist party in power\u2014whether Democratic or Republican\u2014but the capitalist order that breeds oppression and bigotry as a necessary corollary to its system of exploitation.\n\nSex and Social Control\n\nThe capitalist class seeks to buttress the family, which, along with organized religion and the state, form a triad that props up the exploitation of labor. To free women from their deeply entrenched special oppression will take a workers revolution to rip this system of exploitation out by the roots and replace it with a workers government to begin the construction of a socialist world. Only then can we undertake the profound changes in the fabric of everyday life where the institution of the family is replaced by socialized childcare and housework, enabling women to fully participate in social and political life.\n\nThe family is not an immutable, timeless institution, but a social relation subject to historical change. In his classic 1884 work The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, Friedrich Engels traced the origin of the family and the state to the division of society into classes. The development of agriculture allowed the creation of a social surplus. In turn, that surplus gave impetus to the development of a leisured ruling class, thus moving human society away from the primitive egalitarianism of the Old Stone Age (Paleolithic). The centrality of the family began with its role in ensuring \u201clegitimate heirs\u201d for the patriarchal inheritance of property, which required women\u2019s sexual monogamy and social subordination. In the 10,000 years since the advent of class society, the family has taken many forms\u2014including polygamous, extended and nuclear\u2014reflecting different political economies and their cultures and religions. But the oppression of women is a fundamental feature of all class societies.\n\nThe family is a socially conservatizing force that imposes certain behavioral norms. For example, in this country the definition of \u201cmanhood\u201d is, besides getting a girl pregnant, the ability to support a wife and children. But that is becoming ever more difficult given the lack of decent-paying union jobs. If not for wives entering the workforce, the entire bottom 60 percent of the U.S. population would have had real income losses since 1979. At the same time, the institution of the family serves the capitalist rulers by placing the burden of raising a new generation of proletarians on working men and women. Indeed, the \u201cfamily values\u201d crowd (which encompasses Democrats as well as the Republicans) wails about the so-called \u201ccrisis of the family\u201d and insists that it is both right and proper that parents should be wholly responsible for the upbringing of their children.\n\nEven the most cursory examination of laws regulating abortion, contraception and the like that go back thousands of years shows that they are integrally related to the maintenance of the family. Some of the first documented legal measures to strengthen the patriarchal family were enacted in ancient Rome under Augustus Caesar. These included prohibitions against adultery, incentives for widows to remarry, \u201csin\u201d taxes on bachelors 30 years and older, and incentives for fathers of three or more children. The concern of the government was to have enough Roman citizens to fill the ranks of the army and maintain the city of Rome as the core of the Empire.\n\nModern abortion laws show how social and legal institutions have changed to reflect the interests of the capitalist class. In 1803 the British Ellenborough Act marked the advent of abortion as a statutory crime in the English-speaking world. The interest of the ruling class in this law and others following it was to protect the male\u2019s right to heirs, punish (especially single) women for illicit sex and encourage population growth for the newly forged capitalist nation-state, its army and labor pool.\n\nAlongside legal prohibition stands religion, the strongest ideological force against birth control and abortion, especially the Roman Catholic church. The claims by the Pope and other clergy about the \u201csouls\u201d of unborn children are revealed as so much superstition by the science of human development. Yet thanks to the reactionary influence of religion, tens of thousands of women die each year from illegal abortions\u2014lives that would have been saved with access to birth control and abortion. A brief look at Catholic doctrine shows that the church has changed its mind several times about when the nonexistent \u201csoul\u201d enters into the conceptus. For most of the existence of the church, this was considered to be the time of \u201cquickening,\u201d at about the fourth month, when the pregnant woman can feel the movement of the fetus. John XXI, who became pope in 1276, was the author of a book called Treasury of Medicines for the Poor, which is the greatest single source of information about the practical means of birth control and abortion that was known in the Middle Ages. It was not until 1869 that Pope Pius IX declared that abortion \u201cfrom conception\u201d was a sin. This was a political calculation carried out in exchange for recognition of \u201cpapal infallibility\u201d by French Emperor Napoleon III, who was seeking to stem France\u2019s decades-long decline in the birth rate.\n\nThe woman-hating strictures against birth control and abortion, the poisonous bigotry against homosexuals, the witchhunting of \u201cdeviant\u201d sex (who defines that?), the relentless pressure on youth to somehow refrain from giving in to their raging hormones\u2014all these are corollaries of the institution of the family and the social control that it gives the ruling class. As communists we oppose attempts to fit human sexuality into legislated or decreed so-called \u201cnorms.\u201d Government out of the bedroom! The guiding principle for sexual relations between people should be that of effective consent\u2014that is, nothing more than mutual agreement and understanding as opposed to coercion. All consensual relations are purely the concern of the individuals involved, and the state has no business interfering in human sexual activity.\n\nSome History of Birth Control\n\nIn Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance (Harvard University Press, 1994), John M. Riddle explores the ways that pre-industrial people might have tried to enjoy sex without the consequence of procreation. Nobody knows if the methods he documents had much effect on the birth rates, but they certainly show intent. One city in Northern Africa, Cyrene, is believed to have made its name and its fortune from a wild giant fennel that grew nearby, which people believed to have abortifacient effects. Its use became so widespread that it was harvested to extinction.\n\nPeter Fryer, in his witty and erudite book The Birth Controllers, documents that ancient Egyptians used crocodile-dung pessaries (vaginal suppositories) and other dubious methods to control fertility. The Christian Bible\u2019s story of Onan is only the most well known of a long-practiced method (withdrawal), a story used for centuries to put the terror of hell into countless adolescents for masturbation. Some historians believe that the tens of thousands of women who were executed as witches in early modern Europe may have been abortionists and birth control practitioners. In 20th-century America, before the Pill, housewives often resorted to the dangerous practice of douching with Lysol.\n\nIn the 1830s, a Massachusetts doctor named Charles Knowlton was the first person in the history of birth control to be sent to prison for advocating it. The United States also has the dubious honor of passing the first nationwide laws prohibiting the dissemination of birth-control methods. In 1873 Congress passed the Comstock Act, named for its sponsor, Postmaster General Anthony Comstock. It outlawed the circulation of contraceptive information and devices through the U.S. postal service as \u201cpornography.\u201d In 1915 Comstock boasted that he had convicted enough people of \u201csexual misconduct\u201d to fill a 60-car passenger train.\n\nOne of Comstock\u2019s prominent targets in later years was Margaret Sanger. Sanger, who would go on to found Planned Parenthood, began her political life as a member of the Socialist Party, working on the party\u2019s women\u2019s committee. She was working as a nurse, visiting immigrants in New York\u2019s Lower East Side, where she saw firsthand the suffering of women whose health had been ruined by too many pregnancies, who were struggling to feed children they could not afford to support, who all too often ended up butchered by some back-alley abortionist. Soon she began writing about sex education and health for the party\u2019s women\u2019s page under the heading, \u201cWhat Every Girl Should Know.\u201d In early 1913 Comstock banned the column, and the paper ran in its place a box titled \u201cWhat Every Girl Should Know\u2014Nothing; by order of the U.S. Post Office.\u201d\n\nSanger soon left the Socialist Party to focus single-mindedly on fighting for birth control, a term that she herself invented. A courageous woman, Sanger set up the first birth control clinic in the country and endured arrests and imprisonment as she sought to overturn the Comstock Law and to educate women and doctors in birth control methods. She traveled to Europe to research the latest techniques and wrote a sex manual in 1926 where she describes the act of sex in ecstatic, uplifting terms. Seeking to promote the cause of birth control among the wealthy and influential, she steered her movement away from the socialist movement. Sanger, a bourgeois feminist, was willing to make any political compromise she saw as necessary to win advocates to her side and thus embraced some ugly arguments popular among bourgeois reformers of the time, such as endorsing eugenics, including the call to bar immigration for the \u201cfeebleminded.\u201d While the eugenics movement, which stigmatized the poor for their own oppression, was at the time not yet associated with the genocidal movement that would emerge in Nazi Germany, it was widely opposed by socialists. American socialist and birth control pioneer Antoinette Konikow denounced the presence of eugenicists at a 1921 New York City conference on birth control, declaring that the working-class mothers she represented \u201care often considered to be not fit\u201d by such forces.\n\nThe \u201cPopulation Bomb\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes (or not), people have always struggled to control fertility for their own private reasons. But there is also a longstanding chain of argument in favor of population control on the part of bourgeois ideologues. The most notorious of these was made by Church of England parson Thomas Malthus, whose 1798 Essay on the Principle of Population predicted unrelenting misery on account of population growth that would, he claimed, inevitably outstrip available resources. Writing at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Malthus proposed two solutions: leave the poor to die of their misery (he opposed poor relief) and postpone the age of marriage so as to reduce the number of children per couple (that is, \u201cabstinence\u201d as birth control).\n\nMalthusianism was, as Friedrich Engels characterized it in The Condition of the Working-Class in England, \u201cthe most open declaration of war of the bourgeoisie upon the proletariat.\u201d Lenin, too, denounced Malthusianism in a short 1913 article, \u201cThe Working Class and Neomalthusianism.\u201d At the same time, he noted, \u201cIt goes without saying that this does not by any means prevent us from demanding the unconditional annulment of all laws against abortions or against the distribution of medical literature on contraceptive measures, etc.\u201d Lenin called for \u201cfreedom for medical propaganda and the protection of the elementary democratic rights of citizens, men and women.\u201d\n\nThe corollary of Malthusianism, eugenics, with its calls for compulsory sterilization and forced abortions, has its contemporary advocates, including Obama\u2019s \u201cscience czar,\u201d John Holdren. In 1977, Holdren co-authored Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment with the (now largely discredited) population \u201cexperts\u201d Paul and Anne Ehrlich. Dripping with contempt, Holdren et al. wrote: \u201cIf some individuals contribute to general social deterioration by overproducing children\u2026they can be required by law to exercise reproductive responsibility.\u201d Such \u201creproductive responsibility\u201d laws could include \u201ccompulsory abortion,\u201d \u201cadding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods,\u201d \u201csterilizing women after their second or third child\u201d and other \u201cinvoluntary fertility control\u201d methods that would be implemented by a \u201cPlanetary Regime,\u201d which \u201cmight be given responsibility for determining the optimum population for the world.\u201d The ravings of Holdren and the Ehrlichs are worthy of the genocidal Nazi eugenics movement.\n\nMarxists are of course not indifferent to the problem of rapid population growth. But our starting point is the fight for socialist revolution to open the widest vista of human freedom. As we wrote in part two of \u201cCapitalism and Global Warming\u201d (WV No. 966, 8 October):\n\n\u201cOnly a society that can raise the standard of living worldwide can provide the conditions for a natural decline in reproductive rates\u2026.\n\n\u201cUnder communism, human beings will have far greater mastery over their natural and social environments. Both the division between town and country and economic dependence on the family will be overcome. The time when people were compelled to have more children in order to ensure enough manpower to work the land or to care for the elderly will have long passed.\u201d\n\nGenesis of the Pill\n\nMargaret Sanger first had the idea of a \u201cmagic pill\u201d to prevent conception in 1912, but the scientific knowledge to create it did not exist. By the end of World War II, decades of research into human reproductive biology had revealed the crucial role of hormones in conception and pregnancy. In 1953 Sanger, accompanied by International Harvester heiress Katherine McCormick, paid a visit to the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, where Gregory Pincus, who in the 1930s engineered the first in vitro fertilization (a rabbit embryo), conducted his privately funded research. Pincus\u2019s early work had been cited as a great scientific achievement, but the storm of media condemnation over \u201cbabies in test tubes\u201d led to him being denied tenure by Harvard University and all but driven from mainstream research as a \u201cmad scientist.\u201d Another maverick scientist, chemist Russell Marker, had developed a technique, later refined by Carl Djerassi, to extract massive, cheap amounts of a synthetic progestin from a species of enormous yam that grew only in Mexico. The research to create an oral contraceptive was funded almost entirely out of McCormick\u2019s private fortune; the pharmaceutical companies would not touch research into contraception at that time.\n\nThe post-World War II years were hard for American women. The outbreak of the Cold War, the purge of communists and other militants from the unions and the rise of McCarthyism also included a wholesale campaign to put women back into the kitchen and nursery. Many women had escaped from such drudgery during World War II, when their labor was necessary for the war economy. As the government investigated \u201csubversives,\u201d there was an unprecedented state intrusion into family life and the deadening of every aspect of social and intellectual life. A \u201cnormal\u201d family and a vigilant mother were supposed to be the front line of defense against treason, while anti-Communists linked \u201cdeviant\u201d family or sexual behavior to sedition. Most women were married by age 19; the birth rate became the highest in U.S. history.\n\nAt the same time, the groundbreaking reports by Alfred C. Kinsey documented what Americans really did behind the bedroom door (and in some other places, too). And women wanted better contraception. The Pill was first marketed in 1957 as a treatment for menstrual disorders. When word circulated that it suppressed ovulation and prevented pregnancy, doctors across the country were besieged by hundreds of thousands of women asking for prescriptions to treat their suddenly discovered menstrual problems.\n\nThe leap to respectability and mainstream medicine for the Pill came through Harvard gynecologist John Rock, a fertility specialist, who had the medical practice and experience in working with women patients that enabled the first clinical trials to be conducted. A devout Roman Catholic, Rock later wrote a book, The Time Has Come: A Catholic Doctor\u2019s Proposals to End the Battle Over Birth Control, trying to garner public support in a fruitless campaign to make the Catholic church change its denunciation of birth control as a sin.\n\nIn its first incarnation, the Pill had doses of progesterone and estrogen far higher than it does today, leading to serious side effects in some users. These dangers were seized upon by anti-woman bigots, including in the Senate, which in 1970 held a series of hearings to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the matter. Over the years the Pill has been massively tested in many combinations. While risks remain regarding breast cancer and stroke for some, the Pill in fact helps to protect women from ovarian and uterine cancer. Because it reduces or eliminates the menstrual flow, it also reduces the risk of anemia, a serious problem in poor countries. The experience of millions of women, researchers and doctors working to improve the safety of the Pill has provided the basis for the clinical trials and testing now routinely used by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFrom Carter to Reagan: Resurgence of the Religious Right\n\nBy 1960 the Pill was available by prescription as a contraceptive, but laws against contraception remained on the books in many states. Until 1965, it was illegal for married people in Connecticut to use birth control. Until 1972, it was illegal for single people to use birth control in Massachusetts and many other states as well. Bill Baird, a heroic fighter for women\u2019s right to abortion and contraception, spent three months in jail in Massachusetts for giving a package of contraceptive foam and a condom to a Boston University student as a challenge to the law. His case later went to the Supreme Court and helped lay the basis for the right to privacy\u2014the main legal argument behind Roe v. Wade, which established legal abortion in the United States in 1973.\n\nThe legalization of abortion was itself a product of the explosive struggles of the 1960s. For the American bourgeoisie, the all-sided social turmoil and defiance of authority of that period were deeply disturbing. U.S. imperialism was suffering a humiliating defeat at the hands of Vietnam\u2019s heroic workers and peasants. In the late 1970s, a major bourgeois ideological assault was launched to overcome the \u201cVietnam syndrome\u201d\u2014popular hostility to direct U.S. military intervention abroad\u2014and to instill an unquestioning acceptance of \u201cfree enterprise,\u201d God and the family among the population, which included the desirability of dying for one\u2019s country. Coming to office in 1977, the Democratic Carter administration brought \u201cborn again\u201d religious fundamentalism front and center into the White House as it kicked off a renewal of U.S. imperialism\u2019s Cold War drive to destroy the Soviet degenerated workers state, garbed in the call for \u201chuman rights.\u201d\n\nThis was the backdrop for the decades-long anti-sex witchhunt against abortion rights, pornography, gay rights and teen sex as well as for the vicious persecution of AIDS patients and day-care workers, who were targeted and jailed as \u201cchild molesters\u201d amid hysterical allegations of \u201csatanic ritual abuse.\u201d Beginning in the 1980s, scientific research into new contraceptive methods virtually screeched to a halt as Reagan slashed funding for family planning internationally, including for abortion and birth control, leaving many Third World women with not much to turn to. While Obama has reversed this particular policy, he explicitly disavowed defending the rights of women as well as immigrants in his health care proposal, proclaiming that \u201cthe reforms I\u2019m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally\u201d and that \u201cno federal dollars will be used to fund abortion, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.\u201d Obama pledged to uphold the Hyde Amendment, which outlaws Medicaid funding for abortions.\n\nFor Women\u2019s Liberation Through Socialist Revolution!\n\nBirth control methods like the Pill, medical knowledge, understanding of women\u2019s health\u2014these things have indeed taken giant leaps forward in the last 50 years. But exploitation, poverty and religious and cultural strictures deprive most women on the planet of these benefits. For them, daily life is little more than that of a beast of burden. Across vast regions of the globe, in the backward neocolonial capitalist countries oppressed by imperialism, women are swathed in the veil, sold into marriage against their will, or subjected to barbaric punishments like death sentences for \u201cadultery\u201d in Saudi Arabia, Iran and elsewhere. Poverty and backwardness, buttressed by imperialist domination, mean that much of the basic infrastructure necessary to bring basic medical care, contraception and abortion to Third World women is simply not there. Some researchers estimate that in Latin America and the Caribbean the primary cause of death for women between the ages of 15 and 39 is complications from illegal abortions.\n\nFeminism, a worldview counterposed to Marxism, is not capable of generating a program for the liberation of women. Feminism analyzes society as gender-based rather than class-based. It views anti-woman ideology as just bad thinking and puts forward that what is needed is to spread correct ideas and then maybe people will catch on and stop being bigots. Feminism is an anti-egalitarian ideology of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois women who support the capitalist system and seek their own power and privilege within it. Indeed, for women like Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, the good life will only continue to get better. But for working-class, poor and minority women, jobs disappear, wages plummet and life only continues to get harder. The fundamental source of women\u2019s oppression is not bad laws or male chauvinist attitudes\u2014these are but reflections of the subordination of women in the institution of the family and the capitalist system that requires it.\n\nThe liberation of women can be realized only with the victory of proletarian revolution, which will smash all forms of social oppression, lay the material basis to free women from age-old family servitude and reorganize society in the interest of all. The family cannot simply be abolished; rather, its social functions like housework, child rearing, preparation of food, etc., must be replaced by social institutions. This perspective requires a tremendous leap in social development, which can be achieved only through sweeping away capitalist rule on a global basis and replacing it with a rational, democratically planned economy. The International Communist League fights to forge Leninist-Trotskyist parties throughout the world to lead the struggle for working-class power. Inscribed on the banners of these parties will be the struggle for women\u2019s liberation, which is an integral part of the emancipating goals of communism. As we wrote in \u201cIn Defense of Science and Technology\u201d (WV No. 843, 4 March 2005):\n\n\u201cCommunism will elevate the standard of life for everyone to the highest possible level. By eliminating scarcity, poverty and want, communism will also eliminate the greatest driving force for the prevalence of religion and superstition\u2014and the attendant backwardness, which defines the role of women as the producers of the next generation of working masses to be exploited.\u201d\n\nFor women\u2019s liberation through socialist revolution!\n\nhttp://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/968/pill.html\n"

Besides, the fact alone that the election process was rigged by Putin and Comey is enough to consider its outcome as illegitimate.\n\nAs a citizen of the Netherlands it amazes me that so many Americans seem to be willing to put up with the fact that they (will) now have a president in office who rather sides with Putin's regime than stand firmly for US democracy and freedom. It is hardly forgivable."

Created by Icke and Duncan Macmillian, \u201c1984\u201d proved a hit in the U.K. in 2014.\n\nThe New York production is lined up for a summer run at the Hudson Theater, the newly restored Broadway venue that will reopen later this month with \u201cSunday in the Park With George\u201d starring Jake Gyllenhaal. The Hudson is owned by the U.K.-based Ambassador Theater Group, of which Sonia Friedman Prods. is a subsidiary.\n\n\u201c1984\u201d was originally produced in the U.K. by Headlong, Nottingham Playhouse and the Almeida Theater. The design team, which includes Chloe Lamford (sets and costumes), Natasha Chivers (lights), Tom Gibbons (sound) and Tim Reid (video), remains on board, but casting for the American production has yet to be set.\n\n\u201c1984\u201d will open June 22, with the start date for previews still to be determined. As the calendar currently stands, the play will be the first to open of the 2017-18 Broadway season.\n\nhttp://variety.com/2017/legit/news/1984-play-broadway-1201977171/\n "

In the end, people always lose and only the ones moving the pieces win. \n\nIf we know this (history has shown us and we have studied it), why do we keep playing this game and how do we get people (and ourselves!) to wake up and actually do things differently this time around?

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "The problems with current political climate in USA is neither some fluke, nor something unforeseeable. The movement that fed Trump was coming from deep underground all along for many years and the opposing side did nothing tangible except for trying to ridicule it. However true political discourse requires exchange of coherent ideas instead of ad hominem arguments. Anybody notice the hyperinflation of racism accusations on recent years? Well guess what I'm writing this from far far away and in my country it's not that different.\n\nIn order to understand the political struggle of today going around in the entire world, one should first figure out why do people accuse each other with racism so often. Do we see any racist influx\nin our daily political discourse? Well this doesn't seem the case. In fact, if we compare today's political discourse with 1950's we can easily notice the \"sterility\" of today's political discourse from divisive language. But there were much less racism accusations around. In fact blaming someone with racism or nationalism was something big and resulted with a huge public outcry because the pain of WW2 was much more vivid in people's minds. Today despite our more sterile political discourse we overuse the racism accusation and the public became numb for such allegations. \n\nSo what went wrong? Well to start with well known analogies, our societies had a leap from a \"melting pot\" to a \"salad bowl\". Those two analogies are used to describe the \"model\" of the society that we live in. Melting pot hypothesis describes a nation state in which the nation that builds the nation state creates a unique \"national culture\" and the \"newcomers\" or \"new-acquaintance\" will melt in this melting pot, contributing to the final product but also becomes a part of it. This paradigm was used in the early US until 1950's to figure out a way to create a somewhat stable society with the mass exodus coming from different parts of Europe, each having different religious affiliations, different languages, different cultures etc. \n\nThis paradigm had been tested with a lot of ethnic and religious discrimination. For starters, I don't like to compare tragedies, but one should realize that on the ethnic front Irish people had their fair share of discrimination when they first migrated USA. It's funny that despite being the most \"white looking\" whites, Irish people were depicted as \"Gorillas\" when they first came to USA. \n\nOn the religion front, the prejudice against Catholics in mid 19th century US was much like the prejudice against today's Islam, if not worse. I don't know if there will ever be a Muslim US President, but if so, I hope that, that president would not share the same destiny with first Catholic president of USA.  \n\nToday both Catholics and Irish people are proud members of the US society and let alone being discriminated, both groups became dominant figures feeling great pertinence for the US society. I don't think most people realize but interracial marriages actually made it pretty hard for Irish people to actually track their ancestral lines back to Ireland. Most who did are actually partially Irish which shows how deep the roots of the integration of Irish people to the US society. \n\nOn the assimilation front, I think no one can discuss the great contributions of Irish culture to the US society. One can easily feel the strong presence of Irish culture in Boston, Chicago and New York. The elements ranging from cuisine, especially in drinking culture, to St. Patrick's Day, which not only celebrated by the Irish American people, but the entire country. I don't see entire US celebrating an exclusive Arab festive, without controversy, any time soon. \n\nSo, one may say, if \"Melting Pot\" hypothesis was that effective, why did US intellectuals abandoned it. Well there are two very strong opponents against the melting pot type of assimilation. One, is the good old racism and the other is the multiculturalism's \"Salad bowl\". \n\nRacial purity ambitions reject the melting pot type of assimilation because such school of thought opposes the notion of sharing the same identity with another race. That type of mentality upholds the racially divisive rhetoric, supports racial purism instead of a \"common culture\" and formation of ghettos. Such a model requires minimal interaction, if any, among different cultures. Both cultures will stay as pure as possible until a conflict, most of the times resulting from a very solvable and childish problem, shows it's ugly face. In such societies, it's very easy to spark full blown conflicts out of tiny things because both sides are so obsessed with their differences that, they don't see any reason to see the mutual points. It's documented that German soldiers had a very difficult time when killing German Jews because they hated to hear their cries in German. That influenced most of them psychologically. However against Russian Jews they were much less emphatic, mostly because they didn't understand the language and that basic issue enhanced the feeling of \"otherness\". \n\nThe other school of thought that criticize the \"melting pot\" type of assimilation is the multiculturalism and it's \"salad bowl\" model. Unlike the \"melting pot\", \"salad bowl\" requires a somewhat limited interaction between the society and sub-groups. Multiculturalism requires an interaction without assimilation into the dominant culture. So if we think of it like a scale, on one side you have the melting pot assimilation, on the other side you have racial purity, multiculturalism tries to strike a balance in between. Why do we do that? Because according to the supporters it's noble to uphold different cultures and keeping diversity as it is. This model even slows down the natural tendency towards assimilation, resulting from the increasing intercultural means of communication. Feeling of a pride for difference is encouraged in order to \"preserve\" it. \n\nI don't even want to discuss the chauvinistic and oftentimes funny implications of such an empty pride for one's gender, race, sexual orientation, generation or occupation. Just like macro form of ultra nationalism which creates a nonsense parody for a mind that doesn't share the same sentiment, the overemphasis on \"difference\" not only slows down the natural evolution of society, it also changes it's direction. \n\nFor starters the same absurd parody of over-sensitivity, irrational pride, devotion and endless drama that one observes in the case of ultra-nationalists is also seen around the \"activists\" of the so called diversity groups. Such actions not only creates a never ending feeling of victimization that can't be cured with any government policy, but it also creates a reaction on the mainstream culture. Society perceives such attitudes as arrogant, absurd or even dangerous in some cases and starts to reject the culture which it could have normally absorbed without much resistance. Displaying the most extreme end of a different culture and demanding acceptance with the threat of \"otherwise you are racist\" didn't solve any problem until now, and it doesn't seem to solve in the future as well. \n\nThe other issue is, the overemphasis on minority sub-identities encourages an emphasis on dominant sub-identities. Like Christian identity in USA or Islam identity in Turkey. Such identities are \"sleeping giants\" under the national identity. Followers of such identities, albeit being many, should have no particular reason to bring those identities forward, because they shouldn't feel a threat to them. However the never-ending drama type of political discourse exposes a huge vein in the society that could be exploited. One can easily invent a never-ending drama type of populist discourse for the dominant identities and exploit that weakness. As in the case of Trump or Erdogan. This type of kulturkampfs do not only bring instability to the society, it also make the society a much dangerous place for the minorities then it normally should be in 2017. \n\nLet's please leave this \"salad bowl\" nonsense behind. Return to our good old \"melting pots\" because don't forget that your society's \"victim minorities\" are my society's \"proud majorities\". Hence such way of politics is not only a danger to one's own society, but also the other societies as well. "

Think of me as that \"pro-TPP, pro-Ukrainian sovereignty, pro-bipartisan immigration reform\" conservative. \n\nTrump (and Trumpism even more so) disgusts me. I'd vote for anyone right of Vladimir Lenin against the man. I feel compelled as an American to oppose him in all ways possible. I don't have an internship this summer yet, so that's an obvious place to start, but my political tastes aren't really conducive to working for a liberal think tank, or a Democratic congressperson, or a Democratic political consulting firm. Do y'all have any suggestions for some centrist or conservative non-profits/congresspeople/think tanks that are explicitly anti-Trump? \n\nI already know of Evan McMullin's Stand Up America, the ACLU obviously, and No Labels. Personally, I think No Labels is far too conciliatory and unwilling to condemn Trumpism. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks a lot, friends."

I'm no scientist, but I like to think I'm by no means a one source media guy. I watch MSNBC, FOX, CNN as well as read the Independent, CBC and Politico. Nothing that I hear, even Fox, sheds positive light on Trump.\n\nSo where the hell do people get their facts to back up his crazy? A friend told me tonight \"Don't trust the media, they are liars\"...Clearly I rolled my eyes and said nothing more on this, but it brought me here. I understand you can't believe everything, but if you have a brain, you have the means to research shit on your own. But I'm starting to think either I'm not reading the right things, or a lot of people are just brainwashed.\n\nHelp me out... or is to be a Trump supporter to be a man/woman of faith, and simply believe what he says as true.\n\n*note* Talking to my friend about politics is useless, and she's actually my gfs friend. Even when trying to stay calm, it goes nowhere. It's like talking to a machine programmed to be only stubborn or defensive."

I tend to think it is not true, but wouldn't be surprised if it was. This thing gets crazier and crazier with no end in sight. We all know the evidence from the supposed intelligence community showing Russia hacked the election, was manufactured by the CIA. If the left was able to find anything on Trump, believe me, they would have taken him down. Trump is clean, owes no one anything, and is a huge threat to them. He is probably the most honest politician out there, along with Ron Paul."

        "description": "Top 10 reasons why Republicans are disgusting!\nBelieve me.....the Republicans give us many more than just 10 reasons to be thoroughly disgusting......but here they are:\n\n10) Republicans lack ethics and are chronic liars to get what they want. Instead of actually proposing a plan for improvement, they would rather focus their energiy on destroying their opponents.\n\n9) Republicans are not a tolerant or peaceful group.  They seek any opportunity for war and avoid diplomatic solutions.\n\n8) Republicans are only interested in profits and always put profits over people.\n\n7) Republicans are dividers NOT uniters.  That is why they love to divde the majority of voters into segments such as anti-abortion, gun rights or religious issues.\nThese diversion tactics are obvious and people should be smart enought to not get hung up on one issue.\n\n6) Republicans are union busters.  They can't stand to have people organize to have their voice heard.\n\n5) Republicans continue to pursue the same failed policies and mistakes they have made in the past. They refuse to believe that the best times we ever had as a country is when the Democrats were running the country.  That really irritates them.\n\n4) Republicans overwhelmingly protect the top 1% of the wealthiest persons.\n\n3) Republicans want to abolish Social Security and Medicare. Think about what would happen if you just let people perish.\n\n2) A majority of Republicans have a real FEAR OF EQUALITY!  In other words, they have deep racial prejudice.\n\n1) Republicans are just plain MEAN.  Watch the Fox channel for just 5 minutes and you will see what I mean.\n\nPosted 13th July 2011 by Practical Democrat"

        "num_comments": 0,
        "description": "This ballotpedia article has a section on spending: https://ballotpedia.org/April_18_special_election_in_Georgia's_6th_Congressional_District\n\nI looked at the data in this article and did a lot of calculations. Feel free to check my work.\n\n*******\n\n**1: Fundraising:**\n\nJon Ossoff's campaign raised **$8.32 million**, of which **5.6 million** came from small donors (**67%**). The rest presumably from large individual donors. The other Democrats combined got **less than $100 thousand** in contributions.\n\nFor the Republican candidates, Moody self-funded his campaign with **$2 million**, and Bob Gray loaned his campaign **0.5 million** of his own dollars. Gray also got roughly **$220 thousand** in additional contributions. Judson Hill got **$523 thousand** in contributions, and Karen Handel got **$464 thousand** in contributions. It is not known what percentages of the Republican donors were large or small.\n\nMost of the Republican contributions came in the form of PAC spending on pro-Republican or anti-Ossoff advertisements.\n\n*******\n\n**2: Spending:**\n\nAdding together all pro-Democrat spending, the rough **total for Democrats** is **$6.26 million** (of which **$6.18 million** was by the Ossoff campaign, the rest by the other Dem candidates).\n\nNote that the Ossoff campaign saved about 25% of their money (**over $2 million**) for the runoff election.\n\nAnd the rough **total for Republicans** is **$9.855 million** if you only count anti-Dem or pro-Rep spending, and **$10.155 million** if you include $300 thousand in intra-party Republican attack ads paid for by the Club for Growth PAC.\n\nThis would mean ~**97%** of Republican spending was anti-Dem or pro-Rep, only ~**3%** spent on intra-party attacks (this is a primary election, remember). However, Moody also ran an ad against Handel, I don't what percent of his spending that represents, but it's probably not actually 97-3.\n\nBetween **$1.29 million (12.7%**) and **$1.07 million (10.5%)** of Republican spending was from campaign contributions^1 (depending on how much of his own money Gray spent). The rest was from PACs (**6.9 million, 68%**) and from self-funded rich candidates (Between **$2.2 million, 22%** and **$1.97 million, 19%**).\n\nAnd about **$11 thousand** were spent by the 2 independent candidates.\n\n**PAC spending summary:** Club for Growth (Rep): **$300 thousand**. NRCC (Rep): **$2 million**. Ending Spending (Rep): **$0.5 million**. Congressional Leadership Fund (Rep): **$4.1 million**. As noted earlier, CFG was intra-party attack ads, the rest were pro-Rep or anti-Ossoff. DCCC (Dem): One radio ad, **cost unknown**.\n\n*******\n\n**Additional Unaccounted Spending**\n\nThe DCCC (Dem) also spent money on a radio ad featuring the celebrity Samuel L Jackson, but it is not known how much was spent on it, so I didn't include it in the calculations.\n\nThe DCCC (Dem), NRCC (Rep), and RNC (Rep) spent money to increase the number of Democratic/Republican staffers in the district (by +9D, +5R, and +9R respectively), but it is not known how much any of them spent, so this was not included in the calculations.\n\n*******\n\n1. (I calculated Republican \"spending due to contributions\" by adding all non-PAC spending and subtracting 1.8 million which was spent by Moody, who was 95% self-funded, and subtracting different amounts due to Gray, who got some contributions but also loaned his own campaign $0.5 million. Since Gray raised about $220 thousand in contributions and spent about $320 thousand, he had to have spent at least $100 thousand of his own dollars. So his \"self-fund spending\" was anywhere between $100,000 and $320,000, and these bounds are reflected in the numbers I give.\n\n**All** the information in this post can be found in the ballotpedia article I linked to, and the sources cited by it."

        "description": "First off a quick <disclaimer>****\nI dislike hierarchical forms of authority and see both sides of the aisle as a glorified sporting event where it doesn't really change much who wins except their fans are super smug until the next election and their party's brand of tyranny creeps in a bit more..  so I'd appreciate if we could discuss the actual situation and not make it a shouting match about which ideology is more culpable or how yours is fighting the good fight.  I truly believe until one side pushes for their salary to be linked to minimum wage and to establish term limits on all offices, noone is \"serving\" anyone but theirself\n****** </ disclaimer>\n\nSo I have been looking into who has access to my records  and can't really find a conclusive answer.  From what I've found currently your insurer has a copy of your records and can send it to health care providers who buy it from them.  I guess that translates to any approved hospital, pt, or home in their Network? \n\nSo if my insurer is local to the state and I travel across the country to somewhere outside of their Network, and I fall unconscious, wherever I get taken might not have access to my health records?  Then I start thinking of really scary scenarios, like they don't know your allergies or, space-time forbid, they don't notice you have a pre-titanium ubiquity metal implant before they throw you in an MRI.\n\nIf I am correct in this understanding, this lack of efficiency seems like a more important area for government to focus than to start another governmentally-backed bubble (entitlement housing and education have both exploded and negatively affected me in my life, and I see healthcare being the next big bubble blowing ). Ignoring malicious individuals who would hack this info \n - be easier to get birth certificates\n - easier to sign in (no more clipboards of paperwork)\n - quickly and easily run analytics on your health after appointments\n - (potential) open source operations you can run on your health from the convenience of wherevrr you have internet\n - compiled over time records for targeted care\n - they already have easy access to all of my personal information, financial information, and criminal information, why not medical?\n\nThanks. I am eager to hear everyone else's experience and opinion on this. "

        "description": "**What's going on?**\n\nTomorrow, Puerto Rico will decide whether to become a state, to remain a Commonwealth, or to become an independent country.\n\n**The political landscape**\n\nAccording to an opinion poll conducted by the newspaper *El nuevo D\u00eda* among 966 Puerto Ricans on the island, 52% favored statehood, 17% favored the status quo, 15% favored independence, 9% declined to answer, and 7% were unsure.\n\n**The statehood process**\n\nHere's the key steps that Puerto Rico would have to take, in order to become a state.\n\n* If tomorrow's referendum results in a \"yes\" to statehood, Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 will file a petition to the U.S. Congress, asking for Puerto Rico to be recognized as a state. \n\n* Then, Puerto Rico must hold local elections to determine its prospective House and Senate delegations. \n\n* Under the 2010 U.S. Census, and the Huntington-Hill apportionment algorithm currently in use by the U.S. House of Representatives, Puerto Rico would be entitled to five Representatives, and two Senators. \n\n* Then, the U.S. House of Representatives must approve statehood by a simple majority vote, followed by the U.S. Senate in the same manner.\n\n* If both houses of Congress approve, the joint Congressional resolution will be passed to President Trump's desk, where he can either sign it, or veto it.\n\n* If President Trump approves of Puerto Rico becoming a state, then its prospective House and Senate delegations will be seated in the U.S. Congress as voting members, and the national flag will be formally changed on July 4th, 2018, to include 51 stars rather than 50.\n\n**Impact**\n\nPuerto Rico has been a territory of the United States since the conclusion of the Spanish-American War in the summer of 1898. Since 1917, all natural-born Puerto Ricans have been considered natural-born U.S. citizens. \n\nIf admitted, Puerto Rico would be the only U.S. state where Spanish is the majority native language, and along with Maryland, would be a state where the majority religion is Roman Catholicism. Along with Alaska and Hawaii, Puerto Rico would be one of three states located outside the mainland United States.\n\nIf admitted as a state and nothing else changes, it would have 7 Electoral Votes in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and the Electoral College would expand to 540 members. 271 Electoral Votes would be required to win a presidential election. The Senate would expand to 102 members.  To accommodate Puerto Rico's five Representatives, California, Florida, Minnesota, Texas and Washington would each lose a seat in the House of Representatives."

We hear all sorts of other professions being imminently in danger of AI takeover, for better or worse.  Doctors and lawyers are mentioned and I would think those jobs require far more nuanced thinking.  I also think an AI whose prime directive is \"least amount of harm to constituents\" would far surpass anything the Democratic or Republican parties could ever produce.  If there's one job people clearly aren't fit for, imo, it's deciding how to divide the pie. Especially when there are millions of mouths.  I hope this topic starts being discussed more because it feels like a great way to use AI.  "
