I\u2019m here today to convince you to join the Model Democratic party, institute the laws you have always wanted to see be instituted, debate, and connect with a great community. \n\nThe Model Democrats have already made some great legislative progress, such as repealing the Taft-Hartley Act, increasing the minimum wage to $15, creating a negative income tax, increasing funding for education and infrastructure. The Democrats have also spearheaded almost all environmental and green legislation, championed issues of women\u2019s rights, minorities, have stood for net neutrality, and legalized gay marriage. However, this isn\u2019t enough, because there is still so much left to do. \n\nThe Model Democrats are also a great space; everyone is incredibly friendly, and excited to help out new members get accustomed to the simulation. In the community, you can debate and express your opinion, receive help from more experienced members, and try your hand at creating pieces of legislation. The Democrats also have fun weekly movie nights, questions of the week, and so much more!\n\nMidterm elections are coming up, and the Republican party has been on the rise, doing very well in state elections and turning more and more into its real life counterpart. Not to mention, the rise of a new Nationalist\/Fascist party only reinforces that these types of laws are not safe from being overturned without your help.\n\nWhatever Party you do decide to join, we'd be glad to have you in the sim, and I hope you have a great time there as well. We would be incredibly grateful to have you join our sub and have a fantastic, and very realistic experience of government in one of the best communities on the sim!\n\nHere is the link to join: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ModelUSGov\/comments\/525kz7\/join_a_party\/"},{"author":"Leecannon_","created_utc":1483320420,"title":"Who would you support\/think has a good chance to win in 2020?","num_comments":14,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1483331015,"title":"Some Democrat history: an ad for my grandfather's first campaign.

next few days.  \n\nVirginia is having a handful of special elections on January 10.  Of particular note are two races:\n\n* Ryant Washington, running for VA Senate - he is running in a fairly red district, but if he wins, the Virginia Senate will be split 20-20, with the current Lt. Governor, a Democrat, casting a tie-breaking vote, and we will control one of the houses for the remainder of this year.\n\n* Cheryl Turpin is running for the Virginia House of Delegates in a swingier district.  Democrats have more ground to make up in the Virginia House, but every seat matters!\n\nAs you may imagine, a state legislature special election has *really* low turnout, and every person you get to the polls matters a huge deal!\n\nIf you guys are bored and want to spend a little time contributing to some key state races, I'd encourage you to try and help these candidates out!\n\n[Here is a great ra-ra link about Ryant Washington's race](http:\/\/bluevirginia.us\/2016\/12\/want-tell-trump-shove-help-elect-ryant-washington-110-take-back-va-senate-dems).\n\nYou can find links to opportunities to help these candidates, including by phonebanking, at [this site](http:\/\/www.codeblue.team\/jan10va).

I spoke to your assistant who referred me to a young gal who was the head of your campaign at the time. After meeting with her, she never contacted me back again. Although, they do contact me constantly now for money.\nLast night, after my call to you about standing up with the House to object to certification of the elctoral college vote today, you sent me this letter about a completely unrelated issue. Either, like my first encounter with your staff, they are disorganized and ineffectual, or they simply didn't care enough to respond properly.\nI wanted to bring this to your attention because actions, or inactions, such as these, turn constituents against you. There are only 46 democratic senators. Pramila was laughed at by Paul Ryan today when there wasn't one, NOT ONE senator who stood behind her objections to the electoral college certification. Then the house burst into applause. They had won. And the democrats are impotent.\nWords are unimportant Maria. Actions matter. Today no one took action. And when election time returns, we will remember the politicians who are supposed to be our leaders and what their ACTIONS were in trying to stop this insane, illegitimate racist who will become our next president.\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I know how busy this first week back has been.\nAnd thank you ahead of time for your response back. (Patty Murray did not respond to my call last night.) I am posting on FB, Twitter and Reddit the responses that I receive.\nThank you,\nTula Holmes"},{"author":"anonymoose97","created_utc":1483759878,"title":"Trump'\u0080\u0099s Neo-Fascism will be Built on Neo-Fascism of Obama and Democrat Party","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1483760632,"title":"Obama Says Sanders, Far Left Helped Undermine Obamacare","num_comments":13,"description":""},{"author":"Ziapolitics","created_utc":1483763692,"title":"Jason Kander Address the Missouri Legislature-- Message to Republicans","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1483767460,"title":"Pallbearers at the today's funeral for American democracy","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1483768694,"title":"Keith Olbermann Has A Message To Share With Your Pro-Trump Friends","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1483772446,"title":"Senator Bob Casey on Twitter: \"if @realdonaldtrump shows weakness & lifts sanctions against Russia, it will invite other cyber attacks.\"","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Pazaj","created_utc":1483772618,"title":"Donald Trump Plans Revamp of Top U.S. Spy Agency","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1483774922,"title":"John Weaver on Twitter: \"To say there was \"no impact\" on the election due to Russian attack on democracy is wrong.

I think that this history should disqualify Sessions from this position.\n* Sessions has indicated that he believes we should double down on the \"War on Drugs.\" At a time when state legislatures are legalizing marijuana, and opiate addiction is sweeping the nation, I think this policy position is detrimental and unrealistic.\n* Sessions is a divisive figure. At a time when Americans are more politically polarized than ever, this could be an important gesture of unity and bipartisanship.\n\nI closed by reminding them that I am calling to urge Senator X to vote *against* confirming Jeff Sessions.\n\nGood luck!"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1483926836,"title":"GOTV SPECIAL ELECTIONS 1\/10\/17","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1483927539,"title":"Trump's Turning Companies Into Reality-Show Contestants","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"trevor5ever","created_utc":1483927720,"title":"Still Supporting Donald Trump?

The point of all these laws, all these checks and balances was not to serve as a perpetual motion machine that would make our society eternally invulnerable to the horrors of history, but rather an incubator to produce strong citizens who can protect freedom for themselves even when every tool they inherit fails them.\n\nThe infant republic survived many illnesses, endured divisions and catastrophes, and learned from self-inflicted disgraces.  It grew and prospered, matured and shone upon the world in ways that would have brought joy to every luminary of liberty going back to Solon.  America's achievements will be remembered even after its name is corrupted beyond recognition, when bizarre peoples of incomprehensible civilizations in places far from this badly mangle our history in ludicrous popular entertainments.  But now comes the Graduation Exam.\n\nOur national childhood is at an end.

Past generations of Americans have given us all the wisdom we need, sacrificed to stop ancient rivalries in the Old World from smothering the future of the New, and gave of themselves in civil protest - sometimes giving their lives - that we would become a more unified, higher people.\n\nBut that only happens if we recognize when the question is called - if we see when history is presenting us with a fork in the road, and understand that the choice is ours alone, not of any institution or illusory power.  WHEN, not if, the regime of Donald J. Trumpler - an unelected tyrant with zero loyalty to or concern for this country - acts in direct violation of the law, and the cowards, collaborators, and authoritarian martinets blind to everything that underpins liberty tell you that it is regrettable but you must obey...do you?\n\nDo you make yourself an accomplice to crimes against your own innate rights - against the very concept of rights - rather than acknowledge what it is you face, and stand tall?  If you obey, then you are conceding a legitimacy that is not there, making lawful what violates the very foundation of law, and confirming once and for all the failure of the American Experiment in yourself.  You do not recognize that you have a choice; do not recognize what the choice is; do not understand what freedom is, or what you are called upon to do in its defense.  To you, power is authority, and fear is wisdom.\n\nOr perhaps you do recognize the choice, and wish to resist, but you hedge: I will not obey, but will submit.  I will protest, but allow myself to be beaten and rounded up, misunderstanding that pacifism only works if the power it defies can be shamed or overruled by one who can.  The malevolent nihilist tyrant and its sycophant slave-hordes does not hear your moral arguments, and is not impressed or appeased by your willingness to be their victim - in fact, they find it all quite funny.  They would sneer at your weakness and do as they please without consequence until someone stronger than you is forced to act in your defense, rescuing you (or the umpteen millionth victim after you are long dead) from your cowardly Pontius Pilate moral buck-passing.\n\nThe other way is why you have liberty in the first place: To recognize what is self-evident about the rights of human beings, and insist - not request, not argue, but demand with full determination - that they be respected.  Chief among them, and guarantor of all others, is this: That people have the absolute, unalterable, inalienable right to choose the people who govern them.  **There is no authority outside of this**, and power is not authority.  All deviations from and corruptions of this self-evident fact in our existing politics are precisely that: Deviations and corruptions, all of which have added up to bring matters to this head.\n\nSo now an unelected, treasonous, nihilistic tyrant will be wielding the power of the Executive branch of the United States.  He will ignore every law he dislikes and act to the full limit of his *power* in the full knowledge that he has no authority to leverage.  When that happens, each and every citizen will be confronted by an opportunity to choose: An institution under tyrannical occupation will try to tax them, command them to do something - perhaps something innocuous at first - or in any other way that *seems* normal, require their cooperation.  And *that* is the test.\n\nThe test is not whether you hypothetically inform on Mexican teenage diarist \"Ana Franco\" hiding in an attic while the Gestapo tries to find her - if matters get that far, then the test was a long time ago and you already failed.  The test is when an illegal regime with no right - NO RIGHT - to do anything whatsoever with the Executive powers of the United States government tells you (or even just politely requests) that you do something acknowledging their right to wield those powers.  Do you file income tax returns to such a regime?  Do you obey illegitimate judges appointed by it?  Do you file paperwork with institutions that are no longer operating under the Constitution from which their sole authority derived?  \n\nGranting even that level of obedience is inviting a vampire into your house: You are powerless. The slope after that is not slippery, it is *vertical*.  If you obey people with no right to demand in the first place, then you concede their right to do anything.  If being unelected and completely ignoring the Constitution is irrelevant, then you must obey them no matter what their commands are - and you will, because you've already demonstrated that your idea of law and governance is nihilistic, rooted only in whoever holds *power*.\n\nBut power without authority has only one tool at its disposal to deal with defiance: Violence.  So you defy, and you know that passive submission to their violence will have no effect because they are fascists who believe that ends justify means without caveat or exception.  You reject the demands of a regime that has no right to make them, and they send people in uniforms to enforce their commands - maybe people you know; maybe your neighbors; maybe people related to you.  \n\nAnd then you face the same choice that the Founders and the Union soldiers faced, because their friends, neighbors, and relatives wore uniforms of tyranny too: Does freedom perish right then and there so that you can avoid choosing, or is it your turn to give back so that future generations are free?\n\nDonald Trumpler craves power with all the wretched darkness of his being, and his master in the Kremlin craves it even more and has even less concern for the consequences to Americans.  So it is inevitable that they will demand obedience.  It is inevitable that if you refuse, they will attempt to force you.  It is inevitable that if you passively submit, their power will not be affected in any way, because fascism is an absolute break from all rules of civilization.\n\nSo the Test approaches, quickly or slowly.  The people confronting you with it probably will not themselves be fascists - they will consider themselves \"reasonable\" folk just trying to do what they consider their job to be.  It's \"regrettable,\" but \"I'm just following orders.\"  Some may indeed be fascists, but most are just blind or cowardly, and we must do everything in our power to reason with them; to awaken their humanity and awareness; to make them aware that THEY too have a choice in what they do.  But realistically, in most cases, they will obey illegal orders as people like them almost always do throughout history - they will fail their own version of the test.  \n\nAnd then it once again falls to you.  Sooner or later, it is your turn.  If people who are not legitimate parts of your government command you to do something, do you obey simply because they threaten?  If you refuse and they act in force to compel your obedience, do you surrender and in so doing reinforce their power?  Or do you make the choice that past generations made, so that future ones can even know what freedom is, let alone have a chance at it?\n\nThe price is terrible no matter what, so the question is \"Who are you?\"  What do you believe?  Will you defend the physical, tangible fact of freedom rather than just idly praising it in words on its epitaph?  Are you content for the world to have no future but a downward spiral into entropy and degradation, or are you more than that?\n\nYou voted with ballots, and these manics ignored the outcome and will now try to impose their will with guns.  So choose: Is there anything behind your ballot but an idle opinion, for any lawless animal to trample while you weep for a shattered illusion?  Or is there something fundamental behind it - something that goes to the core of who and what you are?    \n\nFight for freedom and you have already won, because freedom is in the choice.  Fight for the future, so that there is one.  Fight for right, because it is right.  \n\nThat's all the best in this country has ever been - behind all the flags and the eagles and the other crap, there was just that: The choice.\n\nRecognize when you are confronted by it, and make it with a full heart.\n\n---\n\n**Freedom Forever**\n\n---\n\nThis has been a communiqu\u00e9 from the Allied democratic resistance at [This Is Not A Game](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/ThisIsNotAGame\/)."},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1484430766,"title":"Lawmakers condemn Trump for attack on John Lewis","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1484430773,"title":"Red-state Democrats turn against Sessions for AG","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1484431168,"title":"Wilfred Chan on Twitter: \"Rep.

It may be worthwhile to convince various American and international organizations to communicate with these governments and explain the situation in the United States.  Namely, that this person does not have the authority to do ANYTHING with respect to US foreign policy or treaties, and that Allied governments could quite profitably ignore and side-step him.\n\nWhile it is proper that federal governments deal with foreign ones, we are faced with an interregnum in Constitutional rule on the federal level, so there really is no one to deal with them - and obviously a traitor who is actively at war with the Constitution is not a substitute.  Sooner or later they will get the idea anyway, but by then the idea they get will be that the way to \"American\" good graces is through **the fucking Kremlin**.\n\nWe must short-circuit this immediately and make Allied governments aware that these people do not represent the United States government, and that their permission is not necessary to do anything in the United States, nor are their commands authoritative where trade regulations are concerned.  Letters from individual citizens will mean little, but with the backing of strong organizations that have already publicly declared themselves fully at odds with Trumpler, they can have significant influence.\n\n---\n\n**Freedom Forever**\n\n---\n\nThis has been a communique from the Allied democratic resistance [This Is Not A Game](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/ThisIsNotAGame\/)."},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1484582597,"title":"Democrats turn to American people to protect | US news","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1484583331,"title":"Is John Lewis' district 'crime infested,' 'falling apart'?","num_comments":20,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"daphaze","created_utc":1484585080,"title":"In a recent town hall Bernie told a small business owner Obama has not stifled his entrepreneurship.

It seems pretty obvious that they are doing this to help Republican candidates get into office in coming elections.\n\nThe website, [linked here](http:\/\/www.turtleboysports.com) looks stupid, I realize, but it captures the local white working-class culture pretty well. This area has a somewhat libertarian strand, and has always had a \"don't tell me what to do\" attitude. They've taken that attitude, though, and used it to build up the far right.\n\nIn any case, I'm wondering if there is a local equivalent in your community, and what is being done to organize against them.

By both camps saying they are for something it seems to give power to the group that has a stronger something they are for. Without context you are subliminally more drawn to something that is pro-life over pro-choice. If those are the two options, I think the emotional pull of the words (without knowing the argument) are going to draw you toward pro-life. I mean it sounds terrific right? Who isn't for life? Choice is also good. \n\nLikewise I'm sure there are numerous other key wedge issues that we should be reframing to call them what they are, not how republicans or conservatives frame them, it only strengthens their arguments.\n\nUphold Traditional Marriage = Anti-Gay Marriage, Anti-Marriage Equality\n\nPro-Young Earth Creationism = Evolution Denier\/Science Denier\n\nI could go on and on but I think my major point is that we need, as a party, to be better about thinking about are framing of the arguments, how the words are constructed and how it plays on the subconscious. This isn't a new idea, George Lakoff has a book on it but I thought it worth mentioning on Reddit because the election of Donald Trump has proven the point immensely well. It's really not the veracity of what your saying that matters but how many times you say it, what type of emotional response it triggers, and the volume with which you say it. I'm not saying we should become pathological liars but be careful not to fall into the traps set up by conservatives - like being called anti-gun instead vs anti gun violence or pro gun safety.\n\nThoughts? \n\n\n"},{"author":"FWdem","created_utc":1494328184,"title":"Senate Democrats pressed on poor diversity in

$500,000 to the Chinese people under the controversial EB-5 program he extended on the same evening,proved that he'll not stop milking the presidency for him and his extended families.","num_comments":4,"description":"Ever since Trump set his foot in the White House, he coveted himself and his family members with billions of dollars of windfall by mixing his presidency with his Trump Inc. or Trump Org. or by whatever name you can call this thing of gaming the system just to enrich him and his extended families to the point of no return. \n\nHis screwing up of our political system came to a new horizon when he told his son-in-law Jared Kushner's sister to head first to China and talk about upcoming new apartments in affluent New Jersey towns with the money to be furnished at a rate of 4% interest under the EB-5 program instead of 16% that are being charged by our banks and other lending institutions as per 2 articles in today's NYT.\n\nAnd to most of these 8,000 affluent Chinese people who were already coming to the U.S.A. by paying $500,000 for visa with very scant scrutiny of their sources of money by our Homeland Security Dept.,Trump's son-in-law's sister pitched her never to be completed Condos and business projects in very affluent and expensive New Jersey towns with only 15 minutes drive from New York.\n\nAnd the ultra rich Chinese people forked out very easily those $500,000 fees for the same program which Trump extended with an Executive Order in the same evening up to September of this year, after Jared Kushner's sister was already present in the packed Hotel ballroom in Beijing just about ready to start her pitch of selling to the Chinese citizens about how to get the U.S. Citizenship with hardly any background checks just like many of their peers did before by forking out $500,000 each under the very highly critical EB-5 program.\n\nThis very controversial program which two Senators want to be scrapped as it didn't do it's main purpose which was to help our distressed towns' people with employment opportunities for at least 10 unemployed American citizens in the totally neglected towns and cities.\n\nBut instead of doing just that Trump's family members and other builders are gerimandering the towns and cities to include only the rich enclaves in the system to build highly expensive condos and apartments which was never the intention when this program was introduced in 1990.\n\nJust the fact that Trump and his extended family members are trying to build highly expensive apartments and expensive businesses in very affluent New Jersey towns employing hardly any poor people, shows very clearly to us all about the length to which Trump and his family members will go to make a fast buck in the range of $50 million by taking full advantage of his power of the presidency . \n\nIt should be pointed out here that Jared Kushner's sister Ms. Nicole Meyer even used her brother's name and his position and high influence in the White House to sell her pitch along with the picture of his father in law to prove his blessings for the project by repeatedly showing Trump's picture on a huge projection screen in the same Ballroom to bolster her presentation.\n\nIn other words she told the attendees in that room that her brother's father-in-law Trump the current president sitting in the White House's Oval room is totally involved in this scam.\n\nAnd lo and behold, before she could even open her mouth she collected promises with advance money in the range of $50 million total from each of her two pitches first in Beijing and then in Shanghai from those Chinese people who want to settle in the United States with their illegal loot from China the country where they could be languishing in jails for making money from illegal sources and also for not paying any taxes on their illegal and scam filled businesses with undeclared income just like what Trump is doing here in U.S. \n\nSo as we're watching this terrible 'conflict of interest' that Trump is engaging sitting in the White House, we can only look at his presidency with awe as to how a President could use his bully pulpit to make gazillions of dollars by just twisting or extending the laws and regulations that can only help him and his extended family's interests.\n\nSo if he really gets his wish of continuing to be the president for 8 years for which he already submitted the paperwork for 2020 presidential election, there will be no other billionaires on this earth who can surpass or even touch his wealth portfolio ever.\n\nWith 382+ registered businesses registered in his name in 60+ different countries of this world with another 100+ businesses that he's operating in his buddies and family members' names, his very high stake gamble of winning the presidency by screwing up the minds of innocent and vulnerable poor White citizens of this country whom he promised in all his campaign stops that if he ever became the president with their votes, he'd create jobs only for them first by putting their interests first before his billionaire buddies.\n\nBut now with his bunch of billionaire buddies in his cabinet and his followers still without jobs because of his reluctance to close down his businesses in poor countries, its high time his voters wake up from their slumber and face the reality that they've been duped by this con man and the snake oil salesman.\n\nYes, if his followers still do not realize that they've been taken for a ride, then only God can help them.\n\nNot Trump.\n\nWho to my mind and many other citizens of this country will be the first Trillionaire of this world if we allow him to continue to function as the president of our great country any longer.\n\nImpeachment is the only way our politicians can stop this menace to our societies."},{"author":"CharlieDarwin2","created_utc":1494331751,"title":"Forget Taxes, Warren Buffett Says.

In that time, we've seen unprecedented amounts of corruption and scandals, both regarding Donald Trump as well as his cabinet.  Even so, the administration has attempted multiple Muslim bans, two failed repeals of Obamacare, a federal hiring freeze, and other assorted nonsense.\n\nEven so, America has stood strong.  Trump's first 100 days, while, again, full of scandals, were largely unproductive, and while I doubt anyone really wants a do-nothing congress, we've still avoided anything truly awful.  It seems barely a week goes by without some type of large-scale protest, whether it be the Women's March the day after Trump's inauguration, the March for Science a few weeks ago, or the many other local events protesting his election and policy.  Even smaller groups have made a difference, such as the National Parks Service's bold step in tweeting the size of Trump's inauguration crowd.  All of these efforts are vitally important to not only show our disapproval, but also to demonstrate that we, the people, will *not* go down without a fight.\n\nHowever, especially in the days immediately after Trump's election, as well as his inauguration, these protests can turn violent.  From [Berkeley](http:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2017\/04\/15\/berkeley-braces-for-planned-pro-anti-trump-rallies\/) to [Portland](http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/election-us-2016-37946231) to even [my own college in Seattle](http:\/\/www.seattletimes.com\/seattle-news\/northwest\/how-the-shooting-at-the-uw-protest-of-milo-yiannopoulos-unfolded\/), what were peaceful demonstrations turned into fights and riots, leading only to injury and arrests.  Of course, I don't blame these protests themselves for the violence, for the violent choices of a few individuals are their responsibility alone.  Even so, we *cannot* allow ourselves to tolerate, or even associate with, violence of this nature.\n\nThe Democratic Party may mean different things to different people, but to me it means love and equality for all.  We strive to accept everyone, regardless of race, gender, or anything else, and we need to demonstrate that with our actions.  Again, the majority of protesters are peaceful, but even a single incidence of violence distorts our message and gives evidence to those who would call us little more than rioters.\n\nFor all I know, I may just be preaching to the choir, and there will always be those who resort to violence, regardless of what anyone else says or wants.

Director was about to hand over the recordings of Trump and his campaign team's voices colluding with the Russian Intelligence services to win the last election.","num_comments":0,"description":"We all cannot forget the moment we saw on tv., when Trump met Mr. Comey the F.B.I. Director for the first time in the White House and how Trump was smiling and looking at Mr. Comey with immense pride and joy. \n\nEven saying to everyone present in that room that \"Now he's more popular than me.\"\n\nAnd if there was any powerful microphone in that room which could record whispering voices, they could hear Trump whispering into the F.B.I. Director's ears, \"Thank you for handing over the presidency to me\", or in other words,\"Thanks for handing over the presidency to me by just one email you sent to the Republicans in Congress just 10 days before the election that literally took the rug out of Hillary's campaign and made me the president\".\n\nTurn back the dial now, it's the same Trump who fired Mr. Comey yesterday after lying in his firing letter that although Mr. Comey assured him on 3 occasions that \"I'm not under any investigation by you, ......\"\n\nBut he still have to fire him because how Comey handled the investigation of Hillary's emails.\"\n\nAnd knowing Mr. Comey we all know that was a blatant lie.\n\nUnder no circumstances, Mr. Comey would tell anyone if they're under any investigation.\n\nNot even the president. \n\nSo what the hell Trump the No.1 liar is talking about here.\n\nAlthough it's true that Mr. Comey did a horrible job by interfering in our election, especially when it was already underway in some states with a stupid news that he found a laptop related to Hillary's classified emails which turned out to be false just one day before the election, for which he definitely broke the Hatch Act of 1939,which prohibits any interference by any elected officials to turn the any election's outcome, but he definitely didn't break the law here while doing his duty to inform the Congress and the American public everything he knows about this history breaking massive collusion by our current president along with his bunch of yahoos in the last campaign with the Russian Ambassador Mr. Kislyak and other Russian hackers like Guccifer 2.0 working under the direct orders of Putin and their highest levels of counter intelligence officers.\n\nThat's the reason why this horrible action by Trump taken yesterday of firing the same F.B.I. Director, whom he praised throughout the later stages of his campaign doesn't make any sense, except that Mr. Comey was about to hand over all the secretly recorded conversations recorded with a F.I.S.A. Judge's  issued warrants and not Obama's as Trump accused him through his twitter madness. \n\nWith Trump's and his associates' distinctively clear voices, in those recordings, where they were conspiring with the Russian Ambassador and other Russian Intelligence officers so that they could defeat Hillary and tilt the election in his favor, about to be handed over to the Senate Intelligence Committee tomorrow, crooked Trump took a preemptive action so that those recordings are not handed over to any committee investigating his collusion with the Russians.\n\nIn one way he fulfilled his stated goal of suppressing the truth that he doesn't want to come out in the public domain as we'll never know what was in those recordings because the acting F.B.I. Director, a Trump's stooge will keep those tapes under lock and key in the F.B.I. Headquarters in Washington forever.\n\nOr simply destroy them like Nixon destroyed most of his tapes kept in the White House in 1974 before he resigned.\n\nOnly a special prosecutor will have the power to issue a subpoena to get those recordings back which will definitely bring down Trump's presidency in the same way like it did for Nixon when he was told by Senate Republicans to just resign and go away in 1974 after the Watergate scandal burst open as soon as Nixon fired the Special Prosecutor Mr. Archibald Cox in 1973 causing an exodus of the Attorney General and Deputy A.G. in an infamous incident dubbed as \"Saturday Night Massacre''.\n\nTrump's Tuesday night's massacre when he fired Mr. Comey will be remembered as the worst thing that could happen to our Democracy when a president doesn't want the truth to come out about his own personal involvement into this saga of Russiagate or Trumpgate of our time.\n\n"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1494413875,"title":"New anti-immigrant law in Texas is so bad the ACLU issues a travel advisory - Texas Gov.

Director who was so close to the investigation to find out the direct contact between Trump and his associates.\n\n\nIf Trump allowed him to stay on the job for few more days and had he given Mr. Comey extra resources like he asked for, it could've been revealed to the American people that almost all of Trump's campaign staffers were either directly involved in this scam. Or partly involved.\n\nAs it's not a secret anymore that Mike Flynn did talk to the Russian Ambassador Mr. Kislyak through an unsecured phone line  from the Trump Tower on Dec 28th last year after he was tipped off by some rogue agent either in the F.B.I. Headquarters in Washington or through his own connection from the Defense Intelligence Services where he was in charge before Obama fired him that our then president Mr.Obama was about to impose more sanctions on Russia for hacking into our country's computers just to tip the balance in Trump's favor.\n\nAnd that was exactly the reason why Mr. Flynn made a call in all probability with Trump's blessings from their Campaign Head Quarters in Trump Tower.\n\nIt is also rumored that Trump was present in the room while Mike Flynn was talking to the Russian Ambassador to assure him that once Trump took over on January 20th,2017,all the upcoming sanctions being put on by Obama that day will be lifted right away along with all the other past sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia for invading Ukraine and the subsequent annexation of Crimea.\n\nBut what we still do not know is how much of that conversation was legally recorded by Mr. Comey with a warrant issued by a F.I.S.A. Judge and not by Obama as Trump falsely accused.\n\nMaybe that was one of the reasons why Trump was quite nervous about the whole revelation by Mr. Comey whom he probably personally requested to withdraw from the investigation about the collusion between him and his Campaign team with the Russian Counter Intelligence Agencies through Mr. Kislyak who was a go between Trump's team and Putin personally who was the Director of F.S.B. which is equivalent to our C.I.A. before he became the president of Russia.\n\nAnd as we also know through the leaked materials from the F.B.I. Headquarters that Trump's old time ally Roger Stone was in constant touch with Guccifer 2.0 which is nothing but a bunch of highly trained Russian hackers.\n\nWith Mr. Stone saying it loudly right before the 3rd Debate between Trump and Hillary that \"in a few days' time there will be a bombshell related to Hillary's campaign staffers, especially the infighting between John Podesta and Hillary, he became guilty as hell because that's exactly what happened in 3 days time when our internet and airwaves were saturated with tawdry stories of infighting between Hillary's campaign team and her campaign chief John Podesta.\n\nAnd all this happened right in front of our eyes where we could read all the personal emails of Hillary and Mr. Podesta' that were dumped on the internet by Julian Assange of Wikileaks.\n\nIt should be noted here that Mr. Stone personally talked to Mr. Assange over the cell phone unlike the way he exchanged conversations with Guccifer 2.0 through emails.\n\nSo as we can see from the above revelations that even if Trump denies now that there was no collusion between him or his campaign staffers with the Russian Intelligence Services to tip the balance of the last election in his favor, these open secrets that I just mentioned here states very clearly that there definitely was lot of direct contacts between Trump's team and Putin's team of hackers.\n\nAnd Trump, who wanted Mr. Comey to get away from the same 'Russian Connection' investigation so that there would be no more fact finding mission by the F.B.I., was totally incensed that the F.B.I. Director would not close the case even after pleading with him personally to hand over all the digital tapes he recorded.\n\nTrump didn't want us to listen to those secretive conversations between Trump's stooges and Putin's stooges.\n\nSo no wonder, out of total frustration and sheer anger Trump was planning for almost a week or more to get rid of Mr. Comey.\n\nIt should also be noted here that it was nothing like from the day one of his presidency as suggested by many of Trump's leeches because we all saw how Trump had shown his appreciation on Mr. Comey on Jan 30th when the F.B.I. Director paid a visit to Trump for the first time along with other law enforcement officials.\n\nSo it is now really becoming a Constitutional crisis for our country when it is becoming clearer everyday that Trump fired the F.B.I. Director because he was coming too close to the truth of our current president's direct involvement in circumventing our existing laws where no citizen is allowed to contact our enemies for election purposes.\n\nEspecially enemies like Russia.\n\nThat's exactly what our F.B.I. Director came to know through listening to the hours of conversations that it was not only Trump's campaign staffers who asked for Putin's help through the Russian Ambassador but in all probability Trump did it too.  If not directly.\n\nSo I personally think that once and if the Special Prosecutor is appointed, Mr. Comey should hand over all of the copies of those digital recordings to the Special Counsel which he might've copied clandestinely in his office in Washington.\n\nAction like that might put him into serious trouble, maybe even forcing to spend some time in jail for revealing Classified Information.\n\nBut he should do it to save our country from foreign hands."},{"author":"TK2510","created_utc":1494546370,"title":"Kamala Harris's first national television interview (w\/ Jake Tapper)","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"delafayette","created_utc":1494550126,"title":"In a Private Dinner, Trump Demanded Loyalty.

Or Lindsey Graham.\n\nSo it is really not a joke that under Trump's instructions his henchmen had approached the Russian Ambassador first for help with the last election. \n\nThose bunch of crooks then approached the Russian Intelligence services through the Russian Ambassador which is totally illegal and under punishable law for any politician to take any help from any foreign government officials to influence our elections.\n\nRepublicans may not like to admit it but there are proofs beyond a shadow of doubt because all of their conversations with the Russian Intelligence Services were electronically eavesdropped and digitally recorded after Mr. Comey got the required warrants issued by a F.I.S.A. judge.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that our F.B.I. Agents working under Mr. Comey's tutelage can prove to the American people that Trump's campaign staffers did conspire or collude with the Russians to win the last election. \n\nThose Republicans can also bet their money that our F.B.I.

And thus no class at all.\n\nJust because Trump lost the popular votes by 3 million, he's creating this hysteria along with most of the Republicans that \n a humongous but a non-existent voter fraud machinery deprived him of his popular win by the same 3 million illegal voters who Trump claims voted for Hillary.\n\nBy creating this very stupid commission and handing over the vice chairmanship at the hands of this very racist Mr. Kobach, a hard-line conservative from Kansas who'd managed to obtain just nine convictions for voter fraud since 2015 as per an article in NYT, Trump is going on a collision course with the judgement of the Supreme Court who didn't want to rehear the judgement given by  Appeals court who opined that N.C. State's claim of massive voter fraud is totally bogus and was designed only to purge the names of Black and minority voters from the Voting lists. \n\nNC State's bogus claims of voter fraud committed by the Black and minority voters and the way they \"removed them from the voters' list with surgical precision'' in the past was nothing but a criminal act as per the lower court's decision.\n\nThe same lower court also struck down the very racist N.C.law  that imposed a very expensive and unnecessary Voter ID requirements knowing fully well that many of our African American and other minority voters couldn't afford to have any I.D. due to their financial difficulties.\n\nIf we look around we'll find that it was not all the reasons why they imposed all kind of restrictions on the minority voters.\n\nThese racist dogs also rolled back the early voting days from 17 to 10 days knowing fully well that the Black voters in their state as well as all over the country use the two Sundays before the elections to cast their votes.\n\nYes, these totally racist leeches also eliminated the same-day registrations knowing fully well that most of the teenage Black and minority voters do not preregister themselves before the elections. \n\nThey do it on the same day they cast their ballots.\n\nThat is not all . \n\nThese totally racist North Carolina Republican members' ban on counting votes cast in wrong precincts was also a way of disenfranchising the Black and minority voters many of whom do not have facilities or do not own transportation to get to the right polling booths under very harsh physical conditions  by walking or travelling by buses to cast their votes in far away counties where most of these polling booths were intentionally maintained which are miles, miles away from the minority communities just to create extremely harsh conditions deliberately so that most of our Black and minority voters were not able to vote at all.\n\nThe Supreme Court also made it very clear yesterday to those racist N.C. Republican Senators and other members that these racist dogs were totally wrong when the Chief Justice Roberts refused to rehear the ruling given by the lower Appeals Court last year.\n\nWith that refusal the Supreme Court judges confirmed the ruling by the Appeals court which they said was just right as it was stated very clearly by the lower court that it was the racist Republican and Trump's own White Republican voters who're committing these voter frauds by the millions in NC and all over the country by fraudulently casting their ballots by mail and not in person where they've to prove they're U.S. Citizens but they're  not allowed to vote because of their prior convictions and other felony charges."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1494940698,"title":"Fortune 500 Companies Tell Trump: Don't Abandon Paris Climate Agreement - The so-called \"pro-business\" president is isolating himself from a big segment of the corporate community due to his climate denial.","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"straygeologist","created_utc":1494943334,"title":"DNC Chair Tom Perez Plans to Meet with Pro-Life Democrats","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1494943453,"title":"Family blasts right-wing media for spreading \u2018fake\u2019 news story about slain DNC staffer as Russia scandal deepens","num_comments":62,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1494943557,"title":"After blurting secrets to the Russians, Trump faces a NATO meeting dumbed down for his benefit.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1494945171,"title":"Obama-tied group targets House Republicans over Trump agenda","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"FWdem","created_utc":1494945817,"title":"Rahm Emanuel: Dems need to 'fight for the middle class'","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"brownears","created_utc":1494948472,"title":"Activists confront Republican lawmakers hundreds of miles from home","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1494948643,"title":"Election Day in parts of Georgia, Los Angeles, Pennsylvania, Oregon \u2022 r\/BlueMidterm2018","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1494948756,"title":"Election Day in parts of Georgia, Los Angeles, Pennsylvania, Oregon \u2022 r\/BlueMidterm2018","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1494949120,"title":"Joe Biden to visit N.J. to campaign for Phil Murphy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"rwescott","created_utc":1494949747,"title":"Child Brides Join Push to Raise Marriage Age","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1494950634,"title":"If Donald Trump Were a C.E.O., He\u2019d Probably Be Fired Today","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1494950766,"title":"Health Care Puts House in Play -- Democrats Open Big Lead on Generic Ballot","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1494951243,"title":"Sally Yates says she won't run for Georgia governor","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1494951270,"title":"The myth of Republicans in Congress \u2018pulling away from Trump\u2019 - A few are \u201cconcerned\u201d over Comey\u2019s ouster and Trump sharing secrets with Russia, but not concerned enough to do anything.","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"CharlieDarwin2","created_utc":1494951683,"title":"Someone Is Rearranging Ivanka Trump\u2019s Barnes & Noble Book Display","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"ya_boy_bos","created_utc":1494952616,"title":"Is the Left Abandoning Free Speech?","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1494954011,"title":"Even The Biggest Scandals Can\u2019t Kill Party Loyalty","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"FWdem","created_utc":1494958461,"title":"Poll: Biden is top Dem in 2020 matchup with Trump","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"bailey25u","created_utc":1494958787,"title":"\u2018Pay Trump Bribes Here\u2019 Projected on Trump Hotel in Washington","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"MJ_A","created_utc":1494960823,"title":"Republicans Reaction to Scandals","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"advocate_io","created_utc":1494962050,"title":"Advocate Launching in NY and NJ to Help New Generation Engage with Politics","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1494968456,"title":"Erick Erickson: Trump's Russia Leak Is 'Far Worse' Than Reported","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Anticipator1234","created_utc":1494970194,"title":"BREAKING NEWS: Comey Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"dammand32","created_utc":1494973267,"title":"Trump Compromised Israel By Leaking Intel.

Trump goes on his foreign trip, invoking the 25th Amendment.","num_comments":9,"description":"It is absolutely necessary and imperative for our National Security purposes that Trump's cabinet including VP who has the Constitutional power to remove a president by majority vote under the the 25th Amendment ( if the president protests, this must be confirmed by two-thirds of each chamber of Congress ) should bolt  tomorrow and do just that when Trump leaves on his first ever foreign trip to the middle east, Africa and the Vatican.\n\nMike Pence who'll stay behind in Washington should present himself as the Replacement president with the backing by most of Trump's cabinet members. \n\nI'll bet my money that Trump who has a fear of going abroad will cancel his trip thinking something like his removal from the Presidency is possible on the ground of Section 1 of the 25th amendment that very clearly spelled out that \"in case of the removal of the president from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President\".\n\nIt also states in Section 2 that : \"whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the president shall nominate a VP who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.\n\nIf until a \"president transmits to them in contrary, such powers shall be discharged by the VP as Acting President \".\n\nThe words written in the 25th Amendment in fine line also states that \"within 4 days president tempore like Mr. Pence has to transmit to the Congress that the President Trump is unable to discharge his powers and duties of his office\" and when he does that the Congress has to act and remove the current president Trump from the office within 21 days.  \n\nThis is how a lot of us read the 25th Amendment XXV which replaced the old one because of ambiguous wording of Article II,Section 1,Clause 6 of the Constitution.\n\nWe the concerned citizens of this country also know that it is a doable act on the part of the Congress to allow vice president Pence to assume powers and duties of the office as Acting president and allow our troops to maintain law and order in times of this succession so that Trump's craziest supporters among the otherwise peaceful ones don't take to the streets and start beating up innocent bystanders.\n\nWe also know from an article in NYT today that in 1974 when Nixon's presidency was collapsing and he was drinking heavily and becoming too unstable, his defense secretary, James Schlesinger secretly instructed the military not to carry out any White House order to use nuclear weapons unless confirmed by him or Henry Kissinger.'\n\nThe same article also says that it was unconstitutional. And wise.'\n\nHe just didn't want Nixon to blow up the world out of terrible frustration and anger.\n\nAt this juncture of our Constitutional crisis, it is quite necessary that Trump's Senior cabinet members like 'Jim Mattis, H.R. McMaster, Dina Powell and  Rex Tillerson grit their teeth and stick it out' as per the same article so that Trump doesn't go ballistic and try to nuke some peaceful country randomly."},{"author":"Dangerman1337","created_utc":1495108134,"title":"Race between Democrats running for Virginia governor is neck-and-neck","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1495108787,"title":"For the first time, a majority of Americans polled want Trump impeached","num_comments":21,"description":""},{"author":"Carmac","created_utc":1495116342,"title":"Voter suppression, not fraud, looms large in U.S. elections","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"DoctorWinstonOBoogie","created_utc":1495117996,"title":"Roger Ailes, Who Built Fox News Into an Empire, Dies at 77","num_comments":12,"description":""},{"author":"konorM","created_utc":1495120709,"title":"Democrats hope college voters sway congressional election","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"eaxelrad","created_utc":1495122863,"title":"Fighting for Trump\u2019s impeachment is unlikely to help Democrats win in 2020.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"CausalCrunch","created_utc":1495123736,"title":"Impeachment for Mike Pence","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Druidshift","created_utc":1495124462,"title":"This is why we lose.

I hope this is an appropriate forum for my questions.  \n\nI'm a private sector data analyst with 6 years of consulting and eCommerce experience. I want to put that career on hold and do whatever I can to help restore sanity to our nation by flipping House seats blue in 2018. I'm all for donating and volunteering my time for outreach campaigns - but there must be additional things I can do with my skill set, full time or part time.  Unfortunately, I do not have a strong network in the public sector and am quite lost regarding how to contribute.\n\nSo I have some questions:\n\n1. Do these campaigns need data analysts? What responsibilities, experiences, and skill sets are sought?\n\n2. Where do these campaigns recruit for such roles?  (e.g. LinkedIn, other sites, local communities)\n\n3. At what levels does recruiting occur - should I be targeting individual campaign managers, DNC staff, or somewhere in between?\n\n4. What's the best way to get noticed by these recruiters?\n\n5. When do campaigns start looking for these staff?\n\n6. What are some resources I can use to track Democratic candidacy announcements (so that I can contact the campaign teams to apply)?  When will these announcements occur?\n\n7. Should I be looking at other organizations besides the campaigns themselves? (for example, specific political consulting firms, think tanks, or lobby groups)\n\n8. Any general advice for moving from private sector to the world of political campaign work is also appreciated.\n\n9. Where else should I cross-post these questions to get useful insights?\n\nCurrently, my plan is to send my resume and cover letter to every Democratic campaign in swing districts (with the help of data from swingleft.org). I know I'll need to do a lot more than this to have a high chance of success, so I greatly appreciate your guidance.\n\n\nSome extra background on me in case it helps:\n\n* I completed undergraduate business school in 2011.\n* Most of my career has focused on the analytics, marketing, and finance needs of large retailers (online and offline).\n* I have strong SQL, Tableau, and Excel skills, plus theoretical understanding of machine learning techniques.\n* My stats knowledge is solid.\n* Geography does not matter. I recently returned from employment abroad and have no permanent ties to specific regions within USA.\n\n\nThank you for any insights or guidance!"},{"author":"BigLove99","created_utc":1495218417,"title":"Darwin visits Wall Street - Rethink the Market Along Evolutionary Lines.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"FLTA","created_utc":1495219239,"title":"Montana Democrat closes with health-care message in closely watched congressional race","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"anotherblue","created_utc":1495220194,"title":"Times are hard for Nixon backers | Satirical list of Nixon excuses seems rather appropriate these days","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1495220949,"title":"Biden disses Clinton: \u2018I never thought she was a great candidate.

Director is out to get him, should wake up from their deep sleep and start practicing how to take their president's name out of their consciousness.\n\nThose devotees wake up early in the morning to catch the first tweet from their 'guru' who uses his 'little fingers' a la Marco Rubio's quip in the primaries, and tweets his way out till the middle of the night to keep his 23+ millions of twitter followers in his fold, mostly to rant and rage at the Democrats first.\n\nThen his own party establishment who actually has been pretty good to him by not showing any signs of bringing up any impeachment bill on the floor despite the fact that Trump himself is showing the same signs of anxiety that Nixon had shown in his last two years beginning with the summer of 1973.\n\nI think that is the main reason why his followers who still might be in the range of 50+ millions should look inwards instead of gazing their eyes at Trump's movements, because with Trump 'there is no there there' as stupidly described by George W. Bush's defense secretary Donald Ramsfield.\n\nWith the Ex-F.B.I. Director Mr. Comey, whom Trump fired only because he won't let go of Mike Flynn's inquiry, coming to an open hearing in the Senate,Trump and his supporters should really be worried and concerned about how much and what he'll reveal to the American people about what he knew in June of last year out of those taped calls recorded with bugs planted in the telephones in the Russian embassy in Washington and not in Trump Tower that Trump blamed Obama for.\n\nThose recorded conversations between Trump's campaign team and the Russian Ambassador and other Russian intelligence officers were legally recorded with a F.I.S.A. Judge's issued warrant. \n\nIt's my bet Ex-F.B.I. Director Mr. Comey will take his revenge on Trump for Trump's horrible way of firing him, by also testifying under oath that Trump was way much involved in this conspiracy  with the Russian moles than we know just to tilt the election in his favor by the Russians while destroying Hillary's chances of ever becoming the president of our great country.\n\nHe's also going to testify under oath truthfully that Trump pleaded with him to drop the inquiry he was leading on Mike Flynn's shady activities with the Russians by Trump saying \"Mike Flyyn is a good man. Could you please let him go\", when both of them had the dinner together at the White House on January 27th.\n\nIt's also my bet that he can bring down Trump's presidency by his own strength unlike the  way he destroyed Hillary's campaign through his terrible weakness and utter stupidity by sending that campaign destroying email just 11 days before the election to the Republican members of the Senate which literally took all the oxygen out of her campaign."},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1495368992,"title":"Donald Trump's White House Is the Kremlin on the Potomac: Former FBI Double Agent Offers Explanations - Former counterespionage agent Naveed Jamali says Trump's not a \"Manchurian candidate\"\u2014but could be a stooge.","num_comments":18,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1495374156,"title":"I'm a white male millennial who could have ignored politics.

Convention in Cleveland,OH, \"Lock her up\" should now surrender himself to the authorities instead of stone walling and obstructing the justice by using the 'fifth amendment'' in his upcoming congressional hearings.\n\nWe all know what the candidate Trump said in all his rallies last year denouncing Hillary's staffers and accusing them of 'obstruction of justice' by invoking the 5th saying 'if you're not guilty,why invoke the 5th ?\"\n\nNow if we turn the clock forward it is the same Trump, who became the president not because of his talents but by treachery,crookedness and engaging our worst enemy Russia for his election purposes, is now openly showing his appreciation to Mr. Flynn for his decision to go in the same way invoking the 5th just like what Hillary's team did last year in their Congressional grillings.\n\nTrump not only pleaded to the ex-F.B.I. Director to spare Mr. Flynn from any investigation but is still very much involved in Mike Flynn's life by sending him thank you notes as per an article in NYT today.\n\nBy encouraging Mr. Flynn to stay strong and by giving signals that he need not worry about the whole affair since he got Mike Flynn's back, even citing his firing of Mr. Comey as an example of how far he'd go to save Mike Flynn from going to the jail for 'obstruction of justice' just like many of Nixon's men went in 1973 for lying and trying to obstruct the proceedings which was leading directly at Nixon's Oval office where he kept his audio recordings with the conspiracy to defeat Mr. McGovern by bugging his telephones in the Watergate Hotel.\n\nWe can also bet our money that Trump not only was a silent participant, while Mike Flynn was assuring Mr. Kislyak the Russian Ambassador on December 27th last year the same day Obama was about to impose huge sanctions on Russia and expel 35 Russian spies from our soil, but was approving with verbal commands each and every promises that Mr. Flynn was making to the Russian Ambassador regarding lifting the same sanctions after January 20th, the day of Trump's inauguration.\n\nThat is the main reason why I strongly support the idea that Trump who is still trying to be extremely nice to Mr. Flynn even after being forced to fire him because of that WP story, is guilty as hell and should removed from his office through impeachment.\n\nwhy ?\n\nBecause if we look at Trump's mannerisms and his actions lately of grumbling and ranting about the upcoming investigations instead of encouraging the Congress to clear his name, we can easily surmise that Trump knows in his heart of hearts that his presidency is coming to an end pretty soon.\n\nHe knows very strongly that if Mr. Flynn goes down, his presidency will go down as well for sure.\n\nThat's why I strongly believe that Trump who always bragged about openly how he bought everybody by paying them huge amounts of money might have put millions of money in Mike Flynn's illegal offshore accounts after transferring those huge chunks of money from his own illegally maintained offshore accounts all over the world.\n\nTrump,as I said before who very harshly berated Hillary's staffers for invoking the 5th Amendment, is now extremely relieved that Mr. Flynn has just went in the same way by informing the Congress through his lawyer that he'd do the same at all Congressional hearings.\n\nWhy ? \n\nJust like what I mentioned before that Mr.Flynn is the biggest and the only lifeline at present for Trump's 4+ months old presidency because if and ever Mr. Flynn opens his mouth about what he knew and how much Trump knew about those calls to the Russian spies and the Russian intelligence agency officials, Trump will be standing on the same marine helicopter taking off from the lawns of the White House saluting the crowd just like what Nixon did in 1974."},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1495796479,"title":"Under Trumpcare, Having a High Fever Once Is a Pre-Existing Condition","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Venusian_Yellow","created_utc":1495797933,"title":"I want you to look at this, Democrats.

First\".\n\nHow do we know that ? \n\nBecause with the Senior P.G.A. championship hosted by Trump National Golf Club in Virginia which is just 25 miles from the White House and also happens to be only one of Trump's 26 golf and club resorts in the world, our 'illegitimate president' Trump who still haven't divested his holdings in those properties, is going to make so many millions of dollars just from this particular tournament alone that he could easily fork out $3 million towards the prize money.\n\nGo figure !\n\n"},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1495888934,"title":"Jeff Sessions' Justice Department Backed a Mortgage Corporation Over a Veteran - Happy Memorial Day.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1495889254,"title":"'We Have an Obligation to Speak About Donald Trump's Mental Health Issues...

In his heart he doesn't want to go against Russia by endorsing the agreement.","num_comments":0,"description":"It seems like Trump who most probably doesn't understand exactly what it means by Article 5 of the N.A.T.O. agreement which is also known as North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on April 4th, 1949 and was ratified by the United States in August,1949 between most of the advanced European countries after the end of the World War II.\n\nBut since the entire gamut of the exercise was to contain Soviet Union, now Russia from overrunning smaller European countries like Poland,Hungary,Czechoslovakia now Czech Republic, et Al, situated in the eastern part of the European continent which the Soviet Union took somewhat control any way by forming and calling them part of the Warsaw Pact countries in 1955, may be is in danger of falling apart because of Trump's coziness with Russia's Putin for his help in winning the last election for the presidency. \n\nMost probably Trump doesn't want to torment Russia anymore since all the Eastern European Countries under Warsaw pact freed themselves out of Russia's choke hold.\n\nIt is also very suspicious now after the election about where and how Trump found all the narratives while he was campaigning last year when he was using one excuse or another to condemn all the N.A.T.O. countries for not paying their fair share under Article 5 of the agreement which states very clearly that any attack by Russia or any other countries under the N.A.T.O. umbrella will be an attack on all the countries and they'd fight together. \n\nSo it's becoming too obvious lately with most of the citizens in this country like me as well as our residents starting to believe  that behind Trump's admonition and refusal to renew the contract under Article 5 is his desire to payback all their dues to Russia for all the help that he got including all his talking points that he blurted out in all his campaign stops which most probably came directly from the Russian stooges or the Russian Intelligence operatives who were channeling their ideas through Paul Manafort who was as close to Putin as he was with his boss, the short time president of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko, a very dear friend of Putin who was ousted from power on February 25,2010 at the end of the Ukrainian orange Revolution. \n\nOn the domestic front Trump still doesn't want to recognize that our country and the world will be in peril if he doesn't sign the Paris Climate accord which all the other six European countries ratified now except Trump who believes that if he doesn't sign the agreement, it'll bring all the coal jobs back to our miners who voted for him in huge numbers in the last election.\n\nBut what he doesn't understand is that those jobs were shrinking long before Obama came into power because of automation and the coal miners change of coal extracting tactics from the deep deep mines to the mountain top stripping of the same coal through huge cranes, heavy machines and tractors without hiring that many workers. \n\nOn the other hand Trump who never cared for hiring our citizens or resident workers in his various businesses here and abroad, now is adamant that he'd not sign any Climate Accord if it harms his voters in Virginia,Kentucky et Al,, not knowing how much damage his refusal to ratify that accord is hurting our own atmosphere and our ozone layer as well as the weather pattern all over the world with huge ice capes melting in the Antarctica as well as in  North and South Poles.\n\nGo figure."},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1496072111,"title":"Bremmer Says Merkel-Trump Relationship 'Badly Damaged'","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1496074066,"title":"Trump's Actions Have 'Weakened' The West, German Foreign Minister Says","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"FLTA","created_utc":1496078186,"title":"1 in 4 Florida adults aren't registered to vote, according to non-partisan group","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Unicornfarts69","created_utc":1496086668,"title":"Memorial Day and JFK","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"penguincheerleader","created_utc":1496089025,"title":"The Upcoming Votes Republicans Are Really Dreading: In the next two months, Congress will have to raise the debt ceiling and pass a budget.

Mr. Kislyak as well as to other Russian Counter Intelligence officers from the Trump Tower to mainly assure them about lifting all the sanctions already imposed on Russia by the Obama Administration and also the ones that Obama was about to impose on Russia for their direct hacking of our country's computers, once Trump took over the presidency on Jan 20th.\n\nMr. Comey will also tell us all about the truth that he unearthed behind Russia's direct involvement in our country's last election where Putin didn't play any 'Russian Roulette' but played his card openly to kill the campaign of Hillary whom he hated from the bottom of his heart because of Hillary's support of his opponent in 2011's Russian Presidential election. \n\nIt's my bet as well as of millions of Americans that in this open to the public testimony which is specially requested by Mr. Comey will break open the case against Trump where we could all assume with somewhat certainty that we'll hear Trump's voice that was recorded in that infamous call by Mr. Flynn to Mr. Kislyak.\n\nYes, that recording which Mr. Comey will play before the Congress members will reveal in clear voice of Trump as he was playing the mastermind of Mike  Flynn's promises being made to the Russian Ambassador.\n\nMr. Comey who has a real beef against Trump for removing him from the Director's post unceremoniously while he was in the middle of a conference with his deputies in California, will hold nothing in his chest but by showing us the notes and maybe playing the digital recordings in the Senate of Trump's voices in his copied Cd's, he'll achieve his most successful act of his life as we all can assume will be  the downfall of Trump's 4+ months' old Presidency.\n\nBut as we all came to know fairly well that Trump who doesn't want to lose in his life, will still stick around in the White House like Nixon did till October of 1974 until his own Republican party's senior members went to the White House ordering him to resign right then and there which Nixon complied. \n\nWill Trump do the same? Listen to his own party members' advice?\n\nThat is a billion dollar question which we cannot predict right now because that billions of extra money that Trump is making by milking the presidency through his sons and daughter while doing nothing but sitting behind the desk in the Oval room, firing one executive order after another to help his extended family's businesses. \n\nBut behind all these unpredictability with Trump's impending resignation we should also condemn Mr. Comey's action after he sent that totally useless but deadly for Hillary's campaign email that took all the oxygen out of Hillary's campaign since the event  was that close to the election day. Only before 11 days.\n\nI personally and many other Democrats strongly believe that Mr. Comey should've kept his mouth shut or kept his hand in his pocket before he emailed that deadly news saying he was reopening Hillary's investigation just because his agents found a laptop which he didn't even look into because he didn't ask for a warrant from any judge before he could look what was inside.\n\nAnd he did all that right before 11 days of the election which actually was already underway in many states.\n\nI'm quite sure if he didn't do that, Hillary who lost only because of that email, could pardon him as the president for his earlier comments in a highly publicized press conference of June where he literally admonished her in a public forum that \"Hillary was extremely careless and negligent with her classified emails\".\n\nBut since he didn't do the right thing then but took a totally wrongheaded action by even ignoring his direct boss AG Loretta Lynn's advice which killed Hillary's almost a billion dollar's worth campaign in just a few minutes, giving this monstrous person called Trump our country's reign who the F.B.I. and other counter Intelligence agencies knew all along was in direct contact himself with the representative and other Counter Intelligence Agencies personnel from Russia's F.S.B. who helped Trump in his election by  first extracting as much dirt from Hillary, her campaign manager John Podesta and then spread as much 'fake news' as possible through Wikileaks. \n\nSo while we evaluate Comey's actions we can call him a villain one time for that bloody email for a stupid laptop of Anthony Weiner which contained nothing new but on the other hand he never revealed that he had so much of information on Trump's campaign's ties to the Russian Intelligence agencies' direct and total involvement in our election process where those crooked Russians not only hacked into Hillary's computers but also did many other nefarious activities.\n\nThe correct decision by Mr. Comey would've been to reveal those foolproof evidence 11 days before the election day which could've torpedoed Trump's campaign too.\n\nBut he chose to remain silent .\n\nWhy ?"},{"author":"iDemocrat","created_utc":1496316548,"title":"Democrats\u2019 Bid to Regain Hold on House Begins in California","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"iDemocrat","created_utc":1496316630,"title":"Democrats\u2019 Secret Weapon: Romney Voters","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"FWdem","created_utc":1496316920,"title":"Biden launches PAC, keeping options open","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"FWdem","created_utc":1496317109,"title":"Warren turns her fire on DeVos","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Keystonian","created_utc":1496317126,"title":"Disaster Agency To Weather Hurricane Season With No Leader, Proposed Cuts","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1496317424,"title":"How to Win Rural Voters Without Losing Liberal Values","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1496320296,"title":"U.S. withdrawal from Paris climate deal would be a \u2018disaster,\u2019 Sen.

Turn a profit in a legal, ethical way or be gone. AND corporations ARE NOT PEOPLE!!\nEnvironment - we should be doing everything in our power to help the environment including MORE than what is in the Paris Agreement (like Nicaragua and Costa Rica). Corporations will rape the land if we let them, they have historically shown they cannot be trusted without a strong EPA on their asses.\nCollege and Student Loans - Public, state funded schools should be free. Get rid of student loans all together. They have just enabled universities to raise the price of tuition to the point of wrecking young peoples lives. When I went to college I paid around $100 per credit hour, which would be a steal now and this was only 15 years ago. For profit, diploma mills need to be more heavily regulated and meet stricter educational standards.\nGun Issues- I believe that if you are a law abiding citizen, you should be able to own any gun you want. If you have any violent criminal conviction or mental illness, you should not be able to buy or possess guns, period.\nMilitary and Federal Government- With today's technology, we need to reinvent our armed forces. We should be sleeker and meaner than ever, but nope, the old status quo persists. Government contractors need to be GREATLY scaled back. They rob this nation blind and most do not know the extent to which they have invaded the military and all government agencies. The Democrats are just as culpable in this as the Republicans.

Chief Scott Pruitt.\n\nThis action of Trump was totally unthinkable even 4 months back but now he made it a reality. \n\nTrump took this action yesterday in front of his stupid cabinet members on the front lawns of the White House saying he was pulling our country from The Paris Climate Accord signed by Obama in 2015 along with 195 countries of this world because they cared for this world and wanted to save it from the looming destruction because of the effects from the Green House gases and also  from the effects of the global warming which already is melting all the ice caps in the Antarctica and other polar areas and threatening to flood our coastal cities like Miami in the very near future. \n\nWith this very isolationist policy that he signed on yesterday, Trump is literally dragging us towards our earth's doomsday because the ozone layers which are already of the sizes of huge football fields on top of our atmosphere will increase to a small nation's size and slowly take over the skies of the size of a continent only because of this emissions from the fossil fuel burning and release of other gases as per the findings of most of the Climate scientists in this world.\n\nBut since Trump won the last election fraudulently with the most votes from his uneducated  and under educated supporters who have no knowledge about what climate change means for our earth since most of them dropped out from their high schools before they could learn something knowledgeable that we learnt in our colleges, we can start saying goodbye to our beautiful world only because of our stupid president's actions which is just trying to please his ignorant base.\n\nBut what Trump's ignorant supporters are not realizing is that their messiah is not bringing his share of the jobs back to America which he's touting by saying .''I care more for Pittsburgh than Paris.''\n\nBy signing one contract after another since he became the president through his two adult sons who're always outside this country especially in the South American countries,Trump is literally creating millions of jobs in the countries like Brazil and Ecuador than in Pittsburgh,PA.\n\nAll the soon to be completed Hotels and Casino resorts that his sons are building with the collaborations of their foreign partners are going to be built in Rio de Janeirio,in Brazil and Manila of Philippines and definitely not in Topeka,Kansas or Louisville, KY.\n\nThat is the reason why I'd strongly advice the brainwashed and totally defrauded voters of Trump is to educate themselves like we the Democrats already know that their fake leader who's nothing but a con man and a snake oil salesman doesn't really care for them. \n\nBecause if he really wanted to help his unemployed followers he could easily care less about the higher payrolls in this country compared to China and Bangladesh et Al,and start building new Hotels,Casinos and other hundreds of manufacturing units in this country that he already built and still maintaining in poorer countries where he pays those slave labors a dime a minute.\n\nSo all his actions yesterday of puling us from the historic 'Paris climate Accord' is nothing but a hoax created just to fool his followers one more time since the last election day."},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1496398967,"title":"Obama Slams Trump's Withdrawal From Paris Deal -

( no pun intended here ) degree in Economics from the Wharton school but he never actually shown any proof to our people of that by expressing any flair for either Economics nor any political acumen or any basic knowledge of world affairs.\n\nHis walking away from our 50+ year old N.A.T.O. agreement with major European countries was another example of his giving an advantage to his best buddy Putin's Russia against our national interests. \n\nOne can easily add the old adage in this,saying ,\"One hand washes the other\", with Putin getting a sweetheart deal for his immense help with Trump's election in America where Russian hackers under Putin's direct order ripped apart and then  extracted each and every confidential campaign related emails from Trump's opponent Hillary's computers and paid money to Julian Assange's Wikileaks to publish them immediately to destroy her chances completely.\n\nWith so much of damage to Hillary's election chances, Trump was not finished with his vengeance for Hillary and her boss Obama's reputation or his legacy.\n\nThat is the reason why Trump chose to get out of the 'Paris Climate Accord' that Obama signed with 190 countries of this world so that we could breath better and live longer.\n\nBy doing just that Trump got his heart's pleasure to deny our first Black president any credit that could make him look good.\n\nNow if we don't call Trump the most racist person of this world, what other moniker we could call him with. \n\nNothing. \n\nThat is basically the reason why I strongly believe that Trump has to relinquish his presidency voluntarily as he's totally unfit to be our president and our Commander-in- Chief who kept on asking in all the Intelligence briefings only about when and how he could use the Nuclear weapons.\n\nSo with his shallow knowledge of everything that's happening in this world, our Congress members from both the parties have to decide very fast about how to remove this menace to our societies through impeachment proceedings because of his 'Russia Connection' long before he blows up this whole world."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1496580442,"title":"Twitter users want HBO to fire Bill Maher","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1496582433,"title":"EPA Head Scott Pruitt Offers 'Incoherent Distortions of Reality' at Press Conference toDefend Paris Exit - Catches flak for selectively quoting from 'the environmental left' to defend pulling out.

To that I add, a criminal one too.","num_comments":0,"description":"Yes, we must all should acknowledge that Trump's presidency is not only a lawless one, he is also running a criminal presidency which must be brought to an end by his Republican party members sooner than later.\n\nAnd if the Republicans in the Congress do not heed to the calls of all the Democrats, Liberals and Progressives et Al, in this regard or fail to start their impeachment proceedings against Trump right now to dispatch his behind back to the Trump Tower as a private citizen, then they can jolly well kiss their party's future ambitions, especially the next Congressional or midterm elections as it's called which is only 17+ months away.\n\nGiven the stubborn and egoistical nature of Trump and all the Republicans, we can bet our money that they'll not move or forward any of such measures in the Congress thinking somehow or the other the Democrats who lost 6,000 elections,small and big, during Obama's 8 years in the WH, will be too scared to take any drastic measures like forcing Mitch McConnell to bring the bill for impeachment proceedings in the Senate as the same Dems are also clamoring for Trump's White Working class voters who abandoned Hillary in the last moment as soon as that very damning email was sent to the Republican Senators by Mr. Comey, the now deposed Director of F.B.I. who was ousted in a very crude manner .\n\nIt's true that we the Democrats are still angry the way Mr. Comey destroyed Hillary's campaign all by himself but at the same time we're also happy that he is now trying to correct his mistake by toppling Trump's presidency by also revealing to the American people that the evidence he collected against Trump and his campaign lizards will not give any escape route to Trump and his cohorts in the White House.\n\nMr. comey is on the right track this time by trying to upend Trump's presidency by emptying his soul of any incriminating matters that he came to know against Trump and what he did along with his criminal bunch of campaign staffers like Mike Flynn,Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Carter Page et Al, who became totally intertwined with the Russian Intelligence Services or F.S.B. through their go between Russian spy Mr. Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador in U.S.A.\n\nTrump on the other hand beside being directly involved in those illegal phone conversations between his transition team and the Russian spies, did one more criminal activity by first asking Mr. Comey to drop the investigation of Mike Flynn, calling him a ''good guy''. \n\nYeah, please give me a break, Mr. Trump. \n\n\"Don't you know that by calling Mike Flynn a good guy is like calling a poisonous snake a harmless animal''. \n\n''That's right, Mr. Trump. Your Mike Flynn is our great country's snake who poisoned our country's sovereignty by making friends with the Russian pigs.\n\n'And you too Mr. Trump, you terribly undermined our court systems by name calling our judges and undermining our court systems, it seems like you're hellbent in creating lawless societies and a criminal empire for you and your extended family.\n\nIf you'd ever known the views of most of the true patriotic Americans like me you'll understand that although your bunch of crooked,fake and totally unpatriotic Republicans who always repeat your famous mantra,\"America First\", they're not going to take any actions to punish your campaign staffers who're nothing but our country's traitors.\n\nKnowing fully well through Mr. Comey's first testimony that you and your campaign staff indeed asked and accepted Putin and Russia's personal help to defeat Hillary in the last election, what credibility do have now ?\n\nWho's going to trust you ? Nobody. \n\nEven your buddy Putin acknowledged the other day that some Russian private citizens helped you out of their patriotic instincts which is nothing but a bull as Putin knows in his heart of hearts that those people like Guccifer 2.0 who hacked into Hillary's computers were not private Russian citizens but full time Russian Intelligence Service members from G.R.U. and also from F.S.B.\n\nSo, given so much of evidence of your lawless character by which you're breaking our 'Emoluments measures' written very clearly in our Constitution by our framers that is very clearly stated in gold letters 'that no president or any government officials will accept any gifts or make any monetary transactions with any foreign govt. entities. Period.'\n\nDo you know why ? \n\nBecause they were so afraid of a situation like what you Mr. Trump brought in this country by having a foreign hostile govt. like Russia trying to influence our election mechanism and put their puppet that is you in the White House instead of Putin's personal enemy, Hillary.''\n\nSo as we can see that Trump not only helped the Russians subvert our sovereignty but also made huge amounts of illegal money by milking the presidency irrespective of the clause that I mentioned above when he accepted on the Inauguration night money worth $10,000 a night for his hotel rooms from the foreign govt. entities.\n\nActually he didn't stop there but still accepting hundreds and thousands of dollars on a daily basis which tallies up to millions of unreported windfall from the foreign dignitaries who stay in his hotel in Washington and also in Mar-a-Lago club in Florida beside golfing in his clubs and resorts in New Jersey and all over the world.\n\nWith the recent revelation that the Saudi Govt. paid him $250,000+ on behalf of their efforts to stop the 9\/11 families suing their Government for the massacre in New York and elsewhere as per 24 pages of recently declassified Congressional 9\/11 Commission Report.\n\nIt should be noted here that Trump cut a deal with the same Saudi Govt to thwart any attempts by the 9\/11 victims families to collect any reward money that they're genuinely worthy to claim as  those 24 long missing pages clearly revealed that it was not Afghan or Iraqi hijackers who caused the deaths of almost 4,000+ of our bravest people but the criminals from Saudi Arabia who formed the first 16 hijackers and 1 each from Egypt and 2other midle eastern countries out of a total of 19 animals who were wined and dined and bedded by the Saudi Diplomats operating from their embassy in Washington with full backing of their Ambassador who took his direct orders from the Saudi Royal family in Riyadh. \n\nBefore I conclude let me also state that Trump also broke our \"anti-nepotism' Act of 1967 passed by President Johnson to stop presidents and other govt. officials from appointing their next of kin in any governmental positions. \n\nBut the criminal Trump did just that by illegally hiring his own daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner under the federal payroll in spite of the fact that Jared lied in his security clearance form under perjury of law that he never met any foreign govt. employees in the last 20 years.\n\nWe all know now that was a lie as he met the Russian spy cum plus its Ambassador to U.S. MR. Kislyak 3 times, the same number of times that our current A.G. Jeff Sessions met but perjured himself criminally by stating in his Security clearance form that he never met the Russian Ambassador.\n\nWe all know that was a lie as we all saw what he did on national tv., where he was getting chummy by sitting next to Mr. Kislyak at the Republican Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSo its really totally unfathomable that the Republicans will keep mum about the whole sordid affair where Trump committed a crime but will get away as the Republicans will not impeach Trump knowing that Trump is nothing but a criminal like Nixon was in 1974."},{"author":"captainamericasbutt","created_utc":1496761713,"title":"Can The Trump Brand Win State Elections, Too?","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"konorM","created_utc":1496764135,"title":"Maddow returning to airwaves Tuesday night","num_comments":17,"description":""},{"author":"gloriousglib","created_utc":1496766874,"title":"Women shape 2020 Democratic field","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"PinkSlimeIsPeople","created_utc":1496769128,"title":"It's Not How Many They Are But Where They Are Many","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1496778142,"title":"Sen.

Mr. Jeff Sessions right after meeting Trump in an one on one meeting in a dinner setting in the W.H., the invitation for which was widely seen by everyone on national tv, when Trump made the invitation in Mr. Comey's ears the very first time they met each other right after the election.\n\nWe can also guess what Trump told him in a whispering tone : \"Thank you for making me win with that very destructive email that you sent to the Senate to take all the oxygen out of Hillary's campaign\".\n\nBy the way we must also hear here about what was Mr. Sessions' answer to Mr. Comey's request : \"Sorry, I cannot guarantee you that you'll never meet Trump ever again in any one and one setting\".\n\nNow this case can easily be compared to not so far away time when the Kings used to use their harem girls through their madam and one of the girls asking the madam not to leave her alone with the King again.\n\nBut we're dealing with a situation which is not from those times but the year of 2017 where a sitting president who just won his election through totally scrupulous way mainly with the help of the Russians but also with the same F.B.I. Director who quite unnecessarily sent that damning email to the Republicans in Congress just 11 days before the election which literally ended Hillary's campaign for presidency right away as it gave so much ammunition to dirty minded Trump to tell his supporters literally that if Hillary won she'd have to go to jail right away for that stupid laptop belonging to the totally stupid and a pedophile called Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Hillary's aide Huma Abedin, that was later found to have nothing incriminating to prosecute Hillary.\n\nSo go ahead Mr. Comey, throw up as much as you can like you said in that Senate Judiciary Committee hearing  that the idea that you ruined Hillary's chances in her election, \"makes me nauseating, to put it mildly\".\n\nNow let us all hope that Mr. Comey will not throw up anymore by doing the right thing this time by hurting Trump's reputation very badly tomorrow as much he hurt Hillary's reputation on September  29th last year.\n\nYes, Mr. Comey can make all the Democrats like us and also the liberals and progressives to smile again after that terrible defeat of our candidate in the last election by helping to end Trump's presidency at his hearing tomorrow in the same Senate Judiciary Committee by telling the truth and nothing but the truth that only he knows and that is that Trump told him in a very clear and certain terms to end his pursuit of truth by ending the inquiry on Mike Flynn whom Trump just fired the day before his dinner with Mr. Comey after illegally waiting and stalling for 18 days till the Washington Post broke the story.\n\nSo go ahead Mr. Comey, amend your mistake from last year by doing something good for this country by helping us to remove a Russian mole or Putin's spy called Trump sitting in the White House just like the honest federal investigators like you did by helping to remove the crooked Nixon in 1974."},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1496840223,"title":"Quitters.","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1496840314,"title":"Failure To Launch.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"bcechman13","created_utc":1496842516,"title":"Who is our Leader?","num_comments":10,"description":"So who is our leader now?

Director who in turn told everything to Mr. Mueller that he knew about Trump and his campaign team's connection with the Russian Intelligence Services through the Russian Ambassador to the United States Mr. Kislyak. \n\nAnd that is the reason why Trump is so upset with Mr. Sessions because he literally nailed Trump presidency's coffin shut by allowing his Deputy A.G. Mr. Rod Rosenstein to appoint Mr. Mueller to do the Russia inquiry as well as an inquiry on Trump's personal involvement with the Russians beside his Campaign team's direct engagement with the Russians which most probably will be revealed by Mr. Comey tomorrow at his grilling in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee's gathering.\n"},{"author":"FieldVoid","created_utc":1496855196,"title":"Was Berniecrats\u2019 choice to lead California Democrats cheated out of the chairmanship?","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"DDF770","created_utc":1496857110,"title":"Eric Trump Says Democrats \u2018Not Even People\u2019 Amidst Reports He Scammed Kids With Cancer","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1496859232,"title":"Comey to Tell Senators Trump Pressured Him to Say He Was Not Under Investigation","num_comments":19,"description":""},{"author":"BigLove99","created_utc":1496859467,"title":"New Solar Milestone Has Big Consequences [ A utility signed a power deal at the lowest price ever recorded in the U.S., and prices are likely to keep falling. ]","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BigLove99","created_utc":1496860087,"title":"COMEY's [ Statement for the Record Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ] PDF.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"spanishboyalej","created_utc":1496862370,"title":"Read James Comey\u2019s Prepared Remarks for Testimony","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"UtahAffairsMan","created_utc":1496868972,"title":"Everything you need to know about Utah's largest Trump resistance group","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1496871297,"title":"Senator Angus King not taking any B.S. - \"Why Are You Not Answering These Questions?\"","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"BumBiddlyBiddlyBum","created_utc":1496875574,"title":"Senators try to quiet Sen.

Director today, Trump fails to resign or just ignores the whole thing to stick to the power so that he can make a couple of hundred billion dollars as he is doing right now directly by not divesting any of his business adventures and as well as through his 2 sons and daughter and his hiding son-in-law Jared Kushner's family members, then the Republican Party can surely expect to see a stunning defeat by the beginning of November next year when the results of the mid-term polls are declared.\n\nSo, if this is if what the Republican party stalwarts other than John McCain, Lindsey Graham and others who hated Trump from the core of their hearts for all the foul languages he used against them last year, do not follow up with by literally threatening Trump that if he didn't resign today, they'd start the impeachment proceedings right away, then they'd be acting like real fools forfeiting their long held majority in the Congress.\n\nBut knowing Trump that we all came to know since June of 2015 when he announced his very violent and very degrading campaign to become the president of this country by insulting all the Mexicans for bringing drugs and raping women and killing Americans which we all know are being done by only a handful of Mexicans, we can only expect the reverse of all the efforts what the Republicans will try to do now asking for his quick resignation.\n\nThat is the reason why the Republican establishment leaders must be very forceful to Trump today by making it very clear to his very stubborn head that if he fails to heed their calls for him to resign in a very civil manner and try to make any attempts to stick to his illegally obtained power that he gained only through our staunch enemy for over 50+ years Russia's help, then maybe their party has to take same very harsh and extremely difficult measures to remove him from power as they cannot afford to see the dissolution of their party founded by their great president Abe Lincoln and few other wise men.\n\nSo go ahead Mitch and Paul,remove this cancer from your party before Trump devours your party and exterminates G.O.P. from the face of this earth."},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1496920041,"title":"Jill Stein Says Nothing Happened at Her Dinner With Putin - The Green Party candidate says no money\u2014or even words\u2014were exchanged.","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1496920390,"title":"Next time a conservative says fake news, remind them of Stephen Glass.

Bush and Obama.\n\nHe told the Senate Committee yesterday that after what he encountered in the W.H. that particular day of January 27th this year and especially later on in the Oval Room where Trump kept on asking him to let Mike Flynn's investigation go away.\n\nSo no wonder Comey got scared wondering if he could keep his job as the F.B.I.

So help the God and our Democracy\".\n\nBut given Trump's basic dirty nature, we can only hope and pray that someone up there gives him the proper guidance by telling to his very thick non-political brain \"Hey Trump, it's all over\". \n\nThis way the game, that Trump started playing since June 2015 when he announced his presidential campaign by foul mouthing and insulting all the Mexicans, will turn against him and make him the most hunted person in America with insults and ridicules being heaved on him on a daily basis until he resigns.\n\nSo help the God.

Headquarters in Watergate Hotel since the computers were not so advanced then as it is now that Trump and Putin's cyber hackers used in the most criminal way to extract as much campaign strategies as possible from Hillary's computers just like the campaign strategies that Nixon extracted through his opponent's phone conversations.\n\nSo now Trump's firing of Comey because he won't back down from Trump's goons' criminal activities is quite similar to what Nixon did by firing the Special Prosecutor, Archibald Cox before he resigned in 1974."},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1497011216,"title":"Democrat Jon Ossoff opens up a seven-point lead over Republican Karen Handel","num_comments":12,"description":""},{"author":"Hereissomeadvice","created_utc":1497012233,"title":"The democrats found their collusion proof.","num_comments":4,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"BigLove99","created_utc":1497013072,"title":"Offshore Wind Reaches Cost-Competitiveness Without Subsidies.

He's been around in politics for a long long time. So stop playing your games and stop trying to save your 'illegitimate president's behind\".\n\nSo as we can see a pattern emerging here with most of the Republican members of Congress trying to save Trump's behind by piling on Mr. Comey in the last Senate Hearing saying something like \"Mr.Trump didn't want to shut down the Flynn investigation.Did he ?\"\n\n\"yes, Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, Trump almost demanded that Mr. Comey shut down the Flynn investigation. Don't try to play around with Trump's words and Mr. Comey's notes\".\n\nActually this will be very interesting for all of us to note that as each day of the Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing is moving along under the leadership of a very impartial Republican Chairman Richard Barr, most of the Republican members of the Congress are not trying to condemn what Trump did but rather trying to defend his action where he literally sold our country to Russia.\n\nYes, these bunch of the Republican Congress members are doing nothing but trying to save Trump's skin from the possible fallout of the impending impeachment.\n\nNo wonder these totally shameless and completely unpatriotic Republicans are not accepting the fact that Trump more wittingly than not, invited our staunchest enemy for the last 70 years called Russia or the Soviet Union as they were called then and not only allowed them to interfere in our electoral system but was very glad when Putin accepted the offer and totally devastated Hillary's campaign by using some highly trained hackers like Guccifer 2.0 from the Russian Counter Intelligence Agency with the help of Mr. Kislyak their Ambassador and No.1 spy of the Russia Intelligence services with whom Trump's team and most probably Trump too standing in the background in the Trump Tower office where Trump usually sits, constantly chatted with our country's enemies about all kind of strategies to defeat Hillary in the last election in return for lifting all the sanctions that the Obama Administration imposed on them.\n\nSo now we know how Trump won.\n\nAnd it really shudders me and many of the Democrats,Liberals and Progressives when we think that most of the shameless Republicans are not condemning Trump's action but rather condoning it even though they know that Trump by accepting help for collusion with our cold war enemy against whom we fought so many shadowy or covert or proxy wars and our children did,\"Nuclear Disaster Drills in their schools in the 60's\" and our country built so many thousands of ''Nuclear Fallout Shelters'' all over the country with the total approvals from the Republican Presidents and the Congress members who hated Russia or Soviet Union then more than the Dem Presidents and members of Congress.\n\nAnd now the same Republicans are trying to play down the danger of Russia taking total control of our country's electoral system and not paying any attention to Mr. Comey's assertion in the same Committee hearing that \"They'll come back again\".\n\nThe most probable reason for that maybe the Republicans're trying to capitalize on Trump's 60+ million voters who might not vote for their candidates in the next congressional election next year if they say any words against Trump.\n\nSo this non-action and non-condemning part of those Republicans are nothing but the worst thing that can happen to our fantastic country whom Trump and the Republicans are deliberately trying to hand over to Putin's Russia only because the same Russian hackers will play the same hacking games with all the Dem candidates no matter they're big or small candidates before our elections on Nov 6th,2018.\n\nSo let's all say together who really love this country as true patriots,\"to hell with Trump and these treacherous Republicans who're ready to throw all of us under the Russian bus that will do nothing but trample our 350+ years of independence and sovereignty that we saved with our own American blood, sorrow and tears.\""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1497182590,"title":"Amid growing controversy, Sessions abruptly cancels public testimony - The sudden move comes as Sessions faces more scrutiny for his involvement in the Comey firing and meetings with Russia.","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1497182668,"title":"Conservatives want to restrict abortion so much they\u2019ll endanger their own health care bill","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"dillonban","created_utc":1497185246,"title":"\u2018Strange, Trump slams Qatar for \u2018supporting terrorism,\u2019 yet gives Saudis a blank check\u2019","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieDarwin2","created_utc":1497186538,"title":"Trump's strain with Obama marks departure from presidential fraternity","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"rieslingatkos","created_utc":1497187728,"title":"Why US surveillance bothers me \u2014 and should bother you","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Carmac","created_utc":1497192917,"title":"Can we stop the Circular Firing Squad? | \"The Democratic blame game over the 2016 election won't help in 2018\"","num_comments":118,"description":""},{"author":"sammicliiford","created_utc":1497195735,"title":"Democratic business leader Mike Collier running for Texas Lt.

Religious. Moral. With no human decency.\n\nOtherwise a party,which'd shown so much of flair for being the upholder of our country's independence, our sovereignty and above all 'America First' policies long before Trump stole it from them, is now hellbent upon giving away our country's greatest asset away that is our military might that was mainly built around crushing the Soviet Union's hegemony and the current Russia led by Putin's desire to go toe to toe or to override or trample our great country military adventures.\n\nSince Trump brought the Russians so close to our country's power center Washington's door, it seems like the Republicans' cool Mantra of 'America First' is not the same anymore. \n\nTrump literally brought the concept of 'America Second' and 'Russia First' after he won the election with Putin's help.\n\nWhy I say this ?\n\nBecause if we look at our foreign policy now we'll find as the days go by, all of our future military campaigns will be tailored around appeasing the Russians rather than punishing Russia even for their small infractions either in the middle-east or for the country of Kosovo whom we freed from Serbia which was a Russian ally after the Balkan War.\n\nBy the way it must noted here that  Russia still doesn't want recognize Kosovo as an independent country which they're for more than 20 years.\n\nWe should not also forget what Putin's Russia did with Crimea which they snatched illegally from Ukraine and annexed it.\n\nAt that time of Russian invasion of Ukraine 's territory, our country's Republican party was totally opposed to the Russian move and was ready to tell Obama to nuke Russia if they didn't have any nuclear bombs either.\n\nBut not anymore.\n\nUnder Trump's instructions,the same Republicans who hated Russia more than the Democrats are ready to apologize to Russia for our past actions against them and are very eager to do anything Trump says to please his behind so that Trump tells his 60+ million voters who voted for him and still supporting him for some stupid reasons and another 60+ million supporters who were not eligible to vote in 2016 but now are, to vote for all the down ballot Republican candidates beside voting for members of U.S. Congress.\n\nActually these bunch of cathartic Republicans have brought themselves to such a lower level that even a very respected Senator like Susan Collins from Maine suggested to Mr. Comey in last Thursday's Senate Intelligence Committee haring that it was our Ex-F.B.I. Director 'who had the precedent for one-on-one meetings with Trump when Comey pulled aside Trump to discuss the salacious ''pee-tape'' dossier\",as per an article in NYT today. \n\nYes, it's really very sad to see these 'America be damned. Just think of winning the next election'' Republicans are showing such a horrible example of no national pride and trampling on our 350+ years of independence by openly supporting a man who they themselves are quite sure by now that Trump did indeed take the help of Russian Intelligence Services' to win the last election.\n\nBut what are these treacherous buffoons in the Congress are doing : They're sincerely hoping that Trump will deliver them the Senate which most probably they'll keep in their hands after the next election in 2018 as well as the control of the House which is very vulnerable with very enthusiastic and energized Democratic machinery.\n\nThese treasonous Republicans took the prediction of Mr. Comey that \"They (Russians) will be back\" in the same Senate hearing, not as a threat to our country but as a very welcoming and promising sign that the Putin's Russia will help them to keep control of the 3 branches of the govt. again like what they did in 2016's election which was Hillary's to win and Democrats to take control of the Congress but Trump's very close buddy Putin turned the result completely in the Republicans' favor by putting Trump in the White House and the Republicans are in complete control of the Congress.\n\nYes, under a Trump hegemony the same Republicans who at one time hated Russia more than the Democrats, are ready to appease and apologize to Putin personally and to the Russian citizens in general by lifting all the sanctions that Obama and all other presidents ever imposed on them just because Trump is urging them to do for all the favors to Putin in exchange for what he did to Trump and all other Republican candidates who won only because of the immense damage that the Russian hackers did to all the down ballot Democrats beside annihilating Hillary's campaign by using huge firepower from hundreds of hackers beside Guccifer 2.0  who was Putin's main ace hacker.\n\nGo figure."},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1497268814,"title":"Just tuning in to Virginia governor\u2019s race?

Some nerves.\n\nSo if we really compare Nixon's scandal which ultimately deposed him through his own resignation before the impeachment proceedings could begin,Trump will never face the grilling as long as the Republicans remain his partners in his crime by either remaining totally silent. \n\nOr by giving direct and indirect support to him by saying something like \"Trump is new in this game\", like Paul Ryan said or by insinuating like Senator Susan Collins of Maine did by accusing Mr. Comey directly and indirectly that he is the one initiated the dialogue desiring to haven a one on one meeting with Trump in the White House to blackmail him with an expose or a dossier regarding 'Golden Shower' by a score of prostitutes in the same bed in a hotel room where Obama stayed with Michelle a just a few months' back before Trump rented the same room intentionally to defile Obama's presence there and thus getting a certain satisfaction of vilifying a President whom he hated from the bottom of his heart just because Obama was black.\n\nNow if this man is not the most racist person in this world at this moment, who else could it be. \n\nIf anybody can name some other person who's more racist than Trump is, I like to hear."},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1497284849,"title":"What Nietzsche's Philosophy Can Tell Us About Why Brexit And Trump Won","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Thunderpick84","created_utc":1497286105,"title":"Why FBI Can\u2019t Tell All on Trump, Russia","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1497290914,"title":"The US Government Cannot Be Trusted So Long As Donald Trump Runs It","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1497295310,"title":"\u2018This is unreal\u2019: Senate GOP slammed for hiding \u2018secret\u2019 Obamacare repeal bill from the public - \u201cI admit being kind of stunned that the US Senate healthcare bill is a SECRET,\u201d Canadian author Guy Gavriel Kay writes. \u201cAmerican Constitution actually allows?

Some pull quotes....\n\nWhen asked what the future for the Democrats is:\n\n>29:54: The Democrats have been engaged in an orgy of self-flagellation that is completely uncalled for. [...] My biggest hope in terms of the next election is that the absolutely incredible inspiring multi-faceted diverse resistance that Trump's election has generated -- I mean the day after his inauguration, I woke up and I was just overwhelmed with what this said abotu the future. And I do think the future is in the hands of the next generation, and I think they're up for it. \n\n>I'd like to see more understanding on the part of the Democrats of the importance -- and this is something that Hillary always emphasized, you know they criticized her for not having a message, but the fact is she always emphasized the importance of human right's, whether they be reproductive right's, children's right's, women's rights, immigrant's rights.... and what happened was, in my estimation, we kinda fell into a stupor. There was Obama, this generous, wise, feminist man, and I think we began to feel that these things are safe now. [...] And there's a kind of like collective sleep that the day after the election we all woke up from.\n\nOn why Clinton or the Democrats didn't more strongly call out the Clinton-hate that had been going on for decades:\n\n>34:24: The Democrats have really never learned to 'go low' in an effective way, and this has allowed them to get trampled by the GOP.  I mean, what was our response to this election? 'Mea culpa! What did we do wrong!?' And what that translated to was 'SHE was involved. The Witch. She's the one who led us into this, and her campaign.' [...] Not that I want them to play dirty, right, but there is a certain kind of... I would have liked some different response to what was going on that was stronger. \n\nOn the media's role in this:\n\n>35:20: It's not because I think the media are devils; I don't see them as an opposition party. I want to distinguish myself from Trump on that very clearly. But I think because of what mainstream media has become, there's very little one can do to create another narrative. Once they have their narrative going, it just barrels forward, and nothing is allowed to interfere with it.\n\n>A good example is that exchange. [Comey's interrogation by the House in July about the FBI's decision on Clinton's emails.] I mean, when I saw that I thought 'oh my gosh, in the evening news tonight we're going to hear that Comey admitted tonight that Clinton didn't lie.' But no, we never heard that.\" \n\n>So it was a constant taking of what she had to say and taking a piece of it -- this was a constant since the beginning of her time as the First Lady in Arkansas - giving us a piece of it and not the rest. Like the \"deplorables\" comment. What could she do? What can you do to counter a media that WILL NOT take the full explanations and present them to the public? So I think the media is very powerful and very culpable in this.\n\nIn response to a \"Hillary supporter from the beginning\" who went to law school with Hillary asking why she didn't go after Wall Street like Bernie did:\n\n>36:54: She did! She did. Those speeches were not covered. Having watched it, what was covered were the mass rallies in which Bernie shouted his message to thousands of people. Every time Clinton gave a policy speech that was critical of mass incarceration, Wall Street, it never got covered. Never got covered. \n\n>There's another thing to mention in this all which is what do we value and look for right now in a leader? It seems as though - and okay, these are gross generalizations - it seems as though the more 'feminine' style of conversing, listening, trying to see the other side... what did we see in this election? Who came to the top in terms of popularity? People who love the adoration of crowds, people who love to speak to crowds, people who love to speak in short, declarative very macho sentences. \n\nTo the person who then replied \"So you think Elizabeth Warren is macho?\" \n\n>39:30: No, I don't. I think Elizabeth Warren, if she were to actually -- and you know, I like Elizabeth Warren a lot -- but I suspect that were she get into a position of actually running, we would see something very different coming from the press and from the people. We have some evidence for it. When she was running for Senator of Massachusetts, the press came after her.  She is strident, she is shrill.. when women do that, it reads differently than men do it."},{"author":"BumBiddlyBiddlyBum","created_utc":1497302667,"title":"The Confederate flag largely disappeared after the Civil War.

help from Putin and his Russian Counter Intelligence Services' help, is still not realizing that he cannot run this country with a terribly bigoted personality.\n\nWith 'a second federal appeals court of Ninth Circuit,ruling against his revised travel ban delivering on Monday the latest in a string of defeats for the administration's efforts to limit travel of 180 million people from several predominantly Muslim countries', as per an article in NYT yesterday, Trump should just shut up and put up with this judgement which also said that 'Trump had exceeded his authority Congress has granted him in making national security judgments in the realm of immigration without adequate justification', as per the same article.\n\nBut Trump being Trump, the most arrogant president ever, just cannot listen to any proper reasoning and still hoping for a favorable judgement from the S.C.O.T.U.S. only because his hard core uneducated and under educated and horribly lazy supporters who liked his every words with racist overtones in all his campaigns still wants him to ban all the Muslims coming to this country.\n\nBut what Trump has to realize by himself that although he won his election with the votes of millions of racist bastards, doesn't mean that he can use his presidential power to please his  blood thirsty supporters' hunger to discriminate people on the basis of their color of the skin,their cultures and their religious biases in this country and elsewhere in this world.\n\nTrump and his hard core racist supporters have to know that he's not the president of a banana republic.\n\nBut the president of the United States, a vast, modern and thoroughly diverse country of ours where every nationalities, cultures and religions play a role towards making this country the greatest ever, which we're.\n\nYes, this is the greatest country for ever and we'll not allow Trump and his 60+ millions of voters who voted for because of his bigoted views, to tear apart the very basic fabric of this country on which it was built on.\n\nWe are the true patriots of this country unlike the so called fake patriots like Trump and his Republican Congress members and all of their supporters.\n\nAnd we'll fight tooth and nails in the next election to take over the Congress and then impeach Trump for bringing the Russian hackers into our free country just to win the election and also for his hateful and totally racist sermons full of hatred for people who didn't have the same color of his skin and didn't speak the same language or didn't follow the same culture.\n\nAnd lastly the citizens and residents alike who didn't follow his and his religiously bigoted supporters' Judeo-Christian faith.   \n\nNot because of anything else.\n\nBut what Trump is still not realizing and trying to do,is instead of uniting this country with every possible way, he's trying to divide us all again and again by still trying to ban 180 million citizens of 6 or 7 predominantly Muslim nations from the Middle east and Africa only on the basis of their religion only which is totally against our Constitution as the religious persecutions was one of the solid reasons why our settlers came here from many different countries of Europe where they were first hounded like dogs and when captured, were tortured like anything that any human beings ever seen before them.\n\nAfter those horrible tortures were over, they were killed by fire while still alive. \n\nSo whenever they escaped from the hands of those religiously bigoted absolute tyrant Kings and Queens and their pure animal like henchmen, the first thing they wanted to do after the birth of this great nation was to write about religious tolerance in the Constitution so that no body ever suffers like the way they suffered in their departed countries of Europe.\n\nBut it seems like Trump who never read our Constitution wants to scrap everything that is written in our Bill of Rights, and pass his own authoritarian rules and regulations and take away all our freedom to do anything in this country except holding our guns and ammunition.\n\nWhat a sick guy

Convention in Cleveland, OH ,last year. \n\nWe also came to know now that the same Russian Ambassador visited him one more time in Mr. Sessions office near the Senate Chamber.\n\nWith also a very strong rumor circling around of a third visit in another setting between these two conspirators to upend our electoral process just to make Trump win, Mr. Sessions actually is in a very hot water which he perhaps know because of his offer to tender his resignation to Trump on a different subject of not filing for appeal to the S.C.O.T.U.S. for Trump's first ban of 7 Muslim country's people rather than the 2nd ban on 160 million citizens of 6 countries excluding Iraq.\n\nBut coming back to his very evading testimony yesterday at the Senate hearing we all think that Mr. Sessions should have been more forthcoming since he was under oath again just like last time around when he lied openly without batting an eyelid that if he ever met any Russia Govt. officials.\n\nWe all can bet our money that he knows the implications of lying under oath in any setting in this country as he was a prosecutor and also an active member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for long time about what it really means when anyone lies under oath.\n\nYes, he knows that it means a minimum jail sentence of 5 years \n or maybe more as per the discretion of the trial judge.\n\nAnd that is precisely the reason why I and many other concerned citizens of this country and the residents alike will urge Mr. Sessions to hand over his resignation to Trump with whom he's a wink-wink relationship like we saw yesterday when he didn't want to answer to the direct question about what he told to Trump about Mr. Comey."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1497440657,"title":"African-American Voters Will Be Democratic Kingmakers in 2020","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1497440836,"title":"196 Democratic Lawmakers, Including Pelosi, Sue President Trump","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"8rg6a2o","created_utc":1497441192,"title":"Bernie Sanders: How Democrats Can Stop Losing Elections","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Pazaj","created_utc":1497444736,"title":"Attorney General's Selective Silence Deafens Senate Russia Inquiry","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1497444860,"title":"Donald Trump Is Making Europe Liberal Again","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1497447409,"title":"Oh how cute.

U.S.'s decision to visit two cases brought before it yesterday is quite praiseworthy although it's verdict on the first case of 'free speech' is quite a stretch with all kind of offensive nicknames and monikers that now can be used by anybody or any team like 'Washington Redskins' to describe themselves with very offensive to other ethnic groups or Native Americans in this case without a fear of backlash or impunity.\n\nAnd what will that say about our societies ?\n\nWith insults flying and acute degradation of another American citizen or resident by a certain group to describe the members of their own like this Asian-American dance rock group called the 'The Slants' to mitigate the impact of the words.\n\nThe same way other ethnic groups calling their counterparts sub-humans will be allowed freely and openly after this verdict coming unanimously from the members of the Supreme Court who decided that any law that 'denies protection to disparaging trademarks violated the First Amendment', as per an article in NYT today.\n\nNo wonder this 'decision' was 'viewed by a lawyer for the 'Washington redskins' as a strong indication that the football team will win its fight now to retain federal trademark protection' as per the same article.\n\nYes, Washington Redskins can now use their name freely even though it's very degrading for the Native Americans, who owned this land for ten thousand plus years, who objected to this offensive name for quite some time with no avail . \n\nSince Justice Alito or Justice Roberts' and all the other members of the S.C.O.T.U.S's. current families or their ancestors settled in this land let's say only about 4 hundred years ago from some impoverished European countries, they had no feelings or respects for these Indian tribes who still are actual owners of this land where we're all living.\n\nOur govt. is still paying them mortgages every year for letting us use their land and this is how our nine Justices treated their sentiments. \n\nWith total contempt.\n\nThat is the main reason why I wonder what'll happen if a lawyer or the Solicitor General addresses Justice Samuel Alito or any another Judge in the bench by calling him or her \"a zombie\" or by any other derogatory and very insulting name ?\n\nWill that term also come under 'First Amendment' as these Judges described in their verdict yesterday ?\n\nOr will they use the power of the highest court of the nation and ask for the offensive lawyer or the Solicitor General's  imprisonment under the order of 'contempt of court ? \n\nMost probably as per their verdict yesterday they have to let it pass as an expression of 'free speech' under the Constitution .\n\nSo good luck to them and their version of the word 'free speech'.\n\nBut I and many other American citizens and residents alike  personally won't put up with the insulting tone of a person's personal hateful diatribes against us . \n\nWe'll react.\n\nMost probably in a violent way.\n\nIf Justice Alito or Justice Roberts want to put us behind bars, so be it.\n\nNow coming back to the other major issue that these same nine Justices are going to hear which had grown like cancerous cells called 'gerrymandering'.\n\nYes, all the Justices in the S.C.O.T.U.S. have a moral duty to root out this horrible disease in our political system once and for all so that no party can hang on to their power by just redrawing their districts as per their party's advantage and win all the elections fraudulently like the Republicans are doing right now not only in Wisconsin but all over the country just to stay in power.\n\nStay tuned ."},{"author":"discocrisco","created_utc":1497965611,"title":"Right-Wing Calls for Muslim ''Internment Camps'' Intensify in the US, UK and Germany","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1497966074,"title":"Turns Out Trump Voters Aren't the Same as 'Conservatives' - A new study shows Republicans are way more divided on economic issues than we thought.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1497966711,"title":"Supreme Court Will Decide the Fate of Partisan Gerrymandering - The court just accepted a blockbuster case that will affect elections for years to come.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1497966969,"title":"How 2 Common Medications Became One $455 Million Specialty Pill - After I was prescribed a brand-name drug I didn\u2019t need & given a coupon to cover the out-of-pocket costs, I discovered yet another reason why Americans pay too much for health care.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1497967074,"title":"Trump\u2019s White House Media Blackout Has Reporters Talking Mutiny - After Sean Spicer banned live broadcasts of press briefings, many long-suffering White House correspondents are openly wondering whether it\u2019s worth the hassle anymore.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"FWdem","created_utc":1497967696,"title":"The most profound gap between Clinton and Sanders supporters wasn\u2019t about policy","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1497967936,"title":"GOP sneak attack on health care nears a critical moment \u2014 & it\u2019s a total monstrosity - After all the blatant lies & incoherent tweets, the Republicans' secret deal is nearly done \u2014 & wow, is it ugly","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1497968702,"title":"TODAY is Election Day in GA-06.

Director Mr. Comey's clutches, showed a very common pattern of a guilty mind.\n\nIn this case it was Trump's guilty mind.\n\nHe knew throughout Flynn's ordeal that his National Security Council Member was involved in discussing the sanctions that Obama put on Russia for their hacking activities.\n\nTrump also knew that Mike Flynn had gone to Russia and sat next to Putin in 'RT'or 'Russia Today' tv channel gala and got paid a substantial amount of money for it. \n\nSo all these smaller revelations that Trump thought would never come out in the open and not threaten his presidency, is coming out in the open now and about to engulf him whether he knows it or not.\n\nAnd they're coming out real fast to snare him personally for a possible 'obstruction of justice' because he did tell Mr. Comey to end Mr.Flynn's ongoing Russia investigation by F.B.I. Director Mr. Comey's very personal involvement in the case .\n\nNow, nobody should listen to any skeptics right now and let Trump go off the hook after concluding their own investigations.\n\nThe investigators in Congress as well as those working under the 'Special Counsel' must've gathered enough evidence to at least nail Mike Flynn for 'obstruction of justice' as well as for 'perjury under oath' since he lied in his Security Clearance form that he never met any foreign govt. officials. \n\nWhich is a sheer lie since he met Mr. Kislyak at least twice and talked to him over the phones many times.\n\nSo let's all hope that this investigation concludes early and all the bad dudes go to jail and Mr. Trump goes back to his Trump Tower as a private citizen just like before he moved to the White House.

A week ago before the Georgia 6th election, Politico found that a bunch of Twitter bots had been tied to one account; I can't find the article at the moment, but what I'm trying to get at is is there anything being done to stop this? If not what should we do?\n\nNow I have no real experience with creating twitter bots; I simply report the ones I see. However, one report isn't enough to take down millions of them. I think we should figure out a short-term and long-term counterattack against twitter bots influencing users.\n\nPetitions are helpful, but does it really help? \nI'd like to hear your comments and ideas on how to address this issue.\n\nThank you"},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1498065693,"title":"That Jon Ossoff got so many votes in Georgia is damning for Trump","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"PuffingDragon","created_utc":1498066034,"title":"The Establishment's Russia Fixation Takes A Dark Turn: An Interview With Stephen F.

from 3 other middle-eastern countries to take down our buildings on 9\/11.\n\nBut instead of capturing them and put them behind bars and torturing them instead of those innocent people who couldn't confess because they didn't do anything on 9\/11, Bush chartered a commercial jetliner on 9\/12\/2001 to pick up all those masterminds behind the 9\/11 plot including each and every members of Bin

It was down-voted some, but I usually read these things because I find it interesting from a strategy point of view (how would a pro-life Democrat do in the South, etc.). \n\nAnyways, my favorite part of the article:\n\n>The party\u2019s latest setback has only heightened its internal tensions, with some calling for the ouster of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). But an even bigger challenge for Democratic leaders will be managing the intra-party fight between left-wing heretic hunters and more moderate forces hoping to rebuild Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s coalition of ideologically diverse allies. Roosevelt\u2019s melange of Northern progressives and Southern conservatives passed Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Civil Rights Act. It dominated Congress for most of the 20th century. Tearing down that big tent in favor of a more ideologically homogenized movement would be a recipe for political disaster. \n\n>Instead, to win nationally, Democrats must start thinking locally. Tip O\u2019Neill famously said that all politics are local, and the liberal Boston speaker of the House practiced what he preached. Because of it, O\u2019Neill\u2019s party dominated national politics for decades by recruiting conservatives in the South, moderates in the Midwest and liberals in large industrial states. That embrace of ideological diversity kept Republicans in the political wilderness for 40 years, and I saw the strategy\u2019s impact firsthand during my time in Congress, even during a period when Republicans were in control of the House.\n\n>In 1998, Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina and I traveled the country helping Republicans in tough election fights. One night we found ourselves in a conservative Kentucky district where the Republican should have been ahead by 20 points. I pulled the candidate aside and began peppering him with questions.\n\n>\u201cHow weak is your opponent on the Second Amendment?\u201d\n\n>\u201cOh, he\u2019s got a 100 percent rating with the NRA,\u201d came the response. \n\n>\u201cWhat about abortion? Any weaknesses there?\u201d I asked. \n\n> \u201cThe guy is pro-life.\u201d\n\n>I smiled, excused myself and walked over to Graham. \u201cEnjoy the hors d\u2019oeuvres.

Most of the Americans think he taped the entire conversation over dinner and then erased everything in it to thwart the subpoena issued by the Senate Intelligence Committee.","num_comments":0,"description":"Mr. Mueller, the Special Counsel should call upon a forensic speech and also language specialist in determining to figure out if Trump's latest revelations on Fox tv, that he didn't tape his conversation, was true or not. \n\nOr was it just to scare Mr. Comey from telling the truth in his Senate testimony as he led us to believe in the same interview.\n\nIt is also quite possible that the Ex-F.B.I. Director who's trusted by more Americans than Trump, was going to tell the truth in his testimony in the Senate whether Trump threatened him over a recording which most of us think Trump definitely used it for sure to record their conversations over the dinner in the W.H. and since erased the whole thing after he got the subpoena from the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating the Russian Counter Intelligence Services and their Ambassador Mr. Kislyak's role for possible collusion with Trump personally and his campaign team.\n\nEven Trump just admitted in a tweet feed that the Russians hacked into our country's computers as late as November last year but as his usual habit he blamed Obama in the same tweet for not taking action on that.\n\nTrump, who still haven't got rid of his hangover from Obama's rise to the presidency because of the color of Obama's dark skin which Trump hated almost from his birth to a totally racist father called Fred Trump who was a KKK enforcer or a butcher who nobody knows till this day about how many Black folks he lynched since his very young age, is at it again in blaming the same Obama whom he harassed for more than 7 years saying he was born in Kenya and not in U.S. and thus not eligible to be our president which he knew is not true as anyone with one U.S.Citizen parent can become the President as they're also called,'Natural Born Citizens' too although not very clearly articulated in our Constitution.\n\nWhile writing the Constitution our framers never thought about a situation where John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate in 2008 who was fighting against Obama, who was born in Coco Solo, Panama on a destroyer which was cruising along the country of Panama's territorial waters while his father the captain of the ship was debating whether to dock the ship in one of Panama's port so that his wife could give birth to John McCain Jr. in a Panamanian hospital or not.\n\nBut it was too late as his wife had to give birth to our Senator from Arizona in the U.S.Destroyer that his father was in charge of in the Panamanian waters.\n \nBut the most racist person in America and the world at present  called Trump had nothing to say to McCain when he was running for president against Obama only because McCain is White and Obama is Black.\n\nYeah it's really a shame that a totally racist monster like Trump was allowed to win the last presidential election by our great nation with the help of the Russian Counter Intelligence agencies under Trump's best buddy Putin's help.\n\nAnd the so called patriotic Republicans are doing nothing to stop the Russians from coming back like Mr. Comey said in his testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThese Republicans Senators and Congressmen are just dragging the process instead of concluding right now with Trump's impeachment proceedings for collusion with the Russians. \n\nIt must be very clear to all the Americans that the Republicans in Congress who're controlling the Congress and won almost all the down ballot races including the mayoral and city council elections because of the heavy hacking by the Russian spies, are hoping for a repeat performance from the Russian Intelligence Services come next congressional election in 2018 as they know pretty well that without the Russian help they'd most probably lose most of the elections to the Democratic candidates.\n\nSo no one in this country should not have any illusion that the Republicans including Mitch McConnell and the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan have any interests in snaring any of Trump's associates for colluding with the Russians.\n \nThey'd rather be happy if Trump stays in Power at least till next election so that he can use his influence again and by using his personal charm with Putin will give the Republicans another miracle like last year and hand them over the control of the Congress and all the State Assemblies and the Governors' mansions, city councils  et Al.\n\nThey'll do it all at the cost of our country's security, our independence, our sovereignty and our almost 350 years of writing of the Constitution where the framers put the 'emoluments' clause deliberately so that no foreign powers, kings or kingdoms can make any influence in how we run our country. \n\nTrump broke that clause on the very first day of his presidency when he charged $10,000 per night from the foreign govt. officials  who came for his inauguration and also to cut lucrative deals for their respective governments with our govt., as well as with Trump Inc.\n\nThat was one of the reasons why those foreign govt officials stayed at Trump International Hotel in Washington instead of staying in some cheaper hotels in Washington so that they could curry favor with Trump and his personal business empire.\n\nAnd what did our so called very Patriotic Republican Congress members did : Nothing.\n\nWhy ?\n\nBecause they know Trump's money and his rapport with the Russians will give them the win next year without which it's totally impossible to hold on to their power over Congress.\n\nEven the total Russia haters like John McCain and Lindsey Graham's objections or their outbursts against the Russian hacking into our country's computers are almost mute.\n\nThey no longer object to Trump's belligerence and his sell out of our country to the Russians.\n\nIt's really a shame that none of the Republicans are showing any patriotic characters that they usually try to show to this total degradation of our country's sovereignty because of this very shame full act of Trump who already sold away our country to Russia once and for all.\n\nWe can only hope that the Democrats will muster enough strength to wrestle the power away from the Republicans next year against all odds and stop our great country from falling at the hands of the 'Russian bear' for good."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1498302110,"title":"This app

American businesses have now added 14.8 million jobs since private-sector job growth turned positive in early 2010. Twenty million people have gained health insurance coverage. The American auto industry just had its best year ever. And we are getting more of our energy from the sun and wind, and importing less oil from overseas.\n\n**But too many Americans have been left out and left behind. They are working longer hours with less security. Wages have barely budged and the racial wealth gap remains wide, while the cost of everything from childcare to a college education has continued to rise. And for too many families, the dream of homeownership is out of reach. As working people struggle, the top one percent accrues more wealth and more power. Republicans in Congress have chosen gridlock and dysfunction over trying to find solutions to the real challenges we face. It\u2019s no wonder that so many feel like the system is rigged against them.**\n\n**Democrats believe that cooperation is better than conflict, unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls.**\n\nIt\u2019s a simple but powerful idea: we are stronger together.\n\nDemocrats believe we are stronger when we have **an economy that works for everyone**\u2014an economy that **grows incomes** for working people, creates **good-paying jobs**, and puts a middle-class life within reach for more Americans. Democrats believe we can spur more sustainable economic growth, which will create **good-paying jobs** and **raise wages**. And we can have more **economic fairness**, so the rewards are shared broadly, not just with those at the top. We need an economy that prioritizes long-term investment over short-term profit-seeking, rewards the common interest over self-interest, and promotes innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\n**We believe that today\u2019s extreme level of income and wealth inequality\u2014where the majority of the economic gains go to the top one percent and the richest 20 people in our country own more wealth than the bottom 150 million\u2014makes our economy weaker, our communities poorer, and our politics poisonous.**\n\nAnd we know that **our nation\u2019s long struggle with race is far from over.** More than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, more than half a century after C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, Dolores Huerta, and Larry Itliong organized, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind. **We must face that reality and we must fix it.**\n\nWe believe a **good education** is a basic right of all Americans, no matter what zip code they live in. We will **end the school-to-prison pipeline** and **build a cradle-to-college pipeline instead,** where every child can live up to his or her God-given potential.\n\nWe believe in **helping Americans balance work and family without fear of punishment or penalty**. We believe in at last guaranteeing **equal pay for women**. And as the party that created **Social Security**, we believe in protecting every American\u2019s right to **retire with dignity.**\n\n**We firmly believe that the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street must be brought to an end. Wall Street must never again be allowed to threaten families and businesses on Main Street.**\n\nDemocrats believe we are stronger when we **protect citizens\u2019 right to vote**, while **stopping corporations\u2019 outsized influence in elections**. We will fight to end the broken campaign finance system, **overturn the disastrous Citizens United** decision, **restore the full power of the Voting Rights Act**, and return control of our elections to the American people.\n\nDemocrats believe that **climate change** poses a real and urgent threat to our economy, our national security, and our children\u2019s health and futures, and that Americans deserve the jobs and security that come from becoming the **clean energy** superpower of the 21st century.\n\nDemocrats believe we are stronger and safer when America brings the world together and leads with principle and purpose. We believe we should **strengthen our alliances,** not weaken them. We believe in the power of **development and diplomacy**. We believe our military should be the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the world, and that we must do everything we can to honor and **support our veterans**. And we know that only the United States can **mobilize common action** on a truly global scale, to take on the challenges that transcend borders, from international terrorism to climate change to health pandemics.\n\nAbove all, **Democrats are the party of inclusion**. We know that diversity is not our problem\u2014it is our promise. As Democrats, we **respect differences of perspective and belief**, and pledge to work together to move this country forward, even when we disagree. With this platform, we do not merely seek common ground\u2014we strive to reach higher ground.\n\n**We are proud of our heritage as a nation of immigrants. We know that today\u2019s immigrants are tomorrow\u2019s teachers, doctors, lawyers, government leaders, soldiers, entrepreneurs, activists, PTA members, and pillars of our communities.**\n\nWe believe in **protecting civil liberties** and **guaranteeing civil rights** and **voting rights**, **women\u2019s rights** and **workers\u2019 rights,** **LGBT rights**, and **rights for people with disabilities**. We believe America is still, as Robert Kennedy said, \u201ca great country, an unselfish country, and a compassionate country.\u201d\n\nTwo hundred and forty years ago, in Philadelphia, we started a revolution of ideas and of action that continues to this day. Since then, our union has been tested many times, through bondage and civil war, segregation and depression, two world wars and the threat of nuclear annihilation. Generations of Americans fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of opportunity and dignity\u2014and we are fighting still.\n\nDespite what some say, America is and has always been great\u2014but not because it has been perfect. What makes America great is our unerring belief that we can make it better. We can and we will build a more just economy, a more equal society, and a more perfect union\u2014because we are stronger together."},{"author":"dammand32","created_utc":1498513706,"title":"Legal Expert Explains EXACTLY Which Law Trump Broke When He Lied About Comey Tapes","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"karmachanical","created_utc":1498513881,"title":"#the gop, is now called: Eugenics.","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"Zipo85","created_utc":1498516208,"title":"A Look At The Senate Health Care Bill","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Charingx","created_utc":1498522887,"title":"In 1990, Mitch McConnell Supported Affordable Healthcare for All","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"trevor5ever","created_utc":1498524531,"title":"Transgender Prejudice And The Belief In A Biological Basis For Gender","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"rieslingatkos","created_utc":1498528983,"title":"Trump\u2018s Bogus 'Red Line' In Syria","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1498531013,"title":"The \u2018Resistance\u2019 Lost On Health Care In The House.

Here's week 34: July 8, 2017","num_comments":8,"description":"This week Trump amped-up his assault on the media, including encouraging violence. With this, Trump has distracted the country and media, and taken back the narrative. In the atmosphere of chaos, this week also stands out for the number of important stories that received little or no media coverage\n\n1. As more and more states refused to comply with what Trump described as his \u201cvery distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL\u201d, he questioned, \u201cWhat are they trying to hide?\u201d\n2. By midweek, 44 states and DC refused to provide some or all of the voter roll data requested by Trump\u2019s Election Integrity Commission.\n3. States are denying the request based on concerns over privacy and federal overreach, and also concern that the effort of identifying voter affiliation will be used to purge Democrats from voter rolls.\n4. The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed a Hatch Act complaint against Kobach, saying he used Trump\u2019s commission to solicit political campaign money. \n5. A Maryland official, Deputy SoS Luis Borunda, resigned from Trump\u2019s commission.\n6. Several experts on the regulatory process told The Hill that Trump\u2019s commission may have violated the law by failing to submit the requests to states through OIRA, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act. \n7. A DOJ letter sent to 44 states\u2019 election officials on the same day Kobach and Pence made their requests, asks states to detail their compliance with the NVRA. This request also raised concerns about voter purging.\n8. At a rally in DC Saturday night, Trump continued his attacks on the \u201cfake\u201d media, saying, \u201cI\u2019m President and they\u2019re not.\u201d\n9. On Sunday, Trump tweeted a video created by a Reddit user from both his personal account and the official @POTUS account, showing him violently wrestling down a person whose face is the CNN logo.\n10. The Reddit user was named \u201cHanAssholeSolo\u201d and his posts were full of anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic and other white supremacists materials.\n11. The Reddit user later apologized, but Trump did not. The parents and wife of the CNN reporter who covered the story received around 50 harassing phone calls. Allegedly, CNN did not defend the reporter.\n12. As Trump continued his anti-CNN rhetoric, the cable network\u2019s anchors and executives received death threats and other harassing messages.\n13. Following Trump\u2019s tweet, three media watchdog groups have started to do something they never imagined: documenting violent threats and actions against the media in the US.\n14. Maine\u2019s Governor LePage said he makes up stories to mislead the press. LePage also called the media \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n15. NYT reported the Trump regime discussed using the pending merger between Time Warner and AT&T as leverage over CNN.\n16. On Thursday, Trump media ally Daily Caller reported the WH doesn\u2019t support the merger if Zucker still heads CNN.\n17. Trump ally and Bannon patron Bob Mercer bought 2.5mm shares of Time Inc., owner of Time magazine in the first quarter of 2017. Per Week 33, David Pecker, owner of National Enquirer is also interested in Time Inc.\n18. Maddow reported that TRMS was sent a forged NSA document. Maddow speculated this was an attempt to trick her show into reporting a false story, and hence weakening her credibility and dulling that storyline.\n19. Maddow said that other media outlets may also be receiving forged documents as well, citing recently retracted stories at CNN and Vice.\n20. POLITICO reported on the Trump regime\u2019s obsessive crackdown on leaks from the intelligence community, which has led to an \u201cincreasingly tense and paranoid working environment\u201d in the national security community.\n21. On Sunday, protestors gathered at rallies in dozens of cities around the country to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n22. NBC reported that in Trump\u2019s first 168 days in office, he spent 50 days at Trump properties and 36 days at Trump golf resorts.\n23. NYT reported that while working with industry players, not EPA staff, Pruitt has moved to undo, delay or block 30 environmental rules, a rollback larger in scope than any other in the agency\u2019s 47-year history.\n24. Several states sued over the EPA\u2019s decision to keep a Dow pesticide, which studies show can harm children\u2019s brains, on the market. Per Week 33, Dow spent millions lobbying and donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n25. The Wisconsin assembly passed a bill which would block students from protesting conservative speakers on college campuses.\n26. NYT reported the Trump regime\u2019s latest anti-immigrant tactic is to target undocumented parents suspected of having paid to have their children smuggled into the US.\n27. POLITICO reported that Trump insider Stephen Miller has been holding meetings with agencies on how to further curb the entry of refugees. Miller clashed with Tillerson, who demanded autonomy.\n28. A new law in Florida allows parents and residents to file complaints with school boards to challenge what\u2019s taught in science classes.\n29. Attorneys general for 18 states and DC sued DeVos and the Dept of Education over a decision to roll back rules put in place to help students who have been defrauded by their colleges.\n30. Devos\u2019s Dept of Education may stop publishing the list of college and universities in violation of Title IX for mishandling campus sexual assault. The Obama Administration started the list to hold schools accountable for an issue which impacts 1 in 5 college women and 1 in 20 college men.\n31. WAPO reported the WH gender pay gap until has more tripled under Trump, with female staffers earning on average 63% of what their male counterparts make. This is the biggest WH gender pay gap in decades.\n32. Female journalists were banned from the Speaker\u2019s lobby, a room area where reporters speak to members of Congress, because their sleeveless dressed were not viewed as \u201cappropriate attire.\u201d\n33. In a 53 page memo to the court, Trump attorney Kasowitz argued for the dismissal of a sexual harassment lawsuit against Trump, claiming Trump cannot be sued in state court while in office.\n34. The Auschwitz Memorial condemned a political video posted by Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, which the congressman filmed inside an Auschwitz gas chamber.\n35. At a protest outside Sen Portman\u2019s office in Columbus, OH, a woman in a wheelchair was pushed out of her chair to the ground by a police officer.\n36. The KKK plans a rally in downtown Charlottesville today, and warned that many of its 80\u2013100 members and supporters will be armed.\n37. Pro-Trump Twitter operatives are marketing their services to candidates and others, promising to mobilize their followers and networks for pay.\n38. Guardian reported investigators are looking into whether the Trump campaign and far-right websites coordinated with Russia in spreading fake news. Sen Warner noted key voters in swing states were targeted.\n39. Motherboard reported on an analysis of the Twitter bots that helped Trump, and found the same bots and alt-right narrative emerged in the French election against Macron.\n40. On July 4, NRP tweeted the Declaration of Independence, and was attacked by Trump supporters who called it \u201cpropaganda\u201d and \u201cspam.\u201d\n41. A new NPR\/PBS NewsHour\/Marist poll found Trump\u2019s net approval with Independents has fallen by 17 points since he took office.\n42.

Trump also caused alarm on both sides by raising the specter of firing Mueller and the possibility of pardoning himself and members of his regime.\nFor the first time this week there was bi-partisan reaction: there were resignations, and pushback from national security officials who called out Russia for election meddling. Also of major importance, Congress agreed on an outline for a bi-partisan bill to impose sweeping sanctions on Russia \u2014 a direct repudiation of Trump.\n\n1. According to a FEC filing, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign paid $50k to Donald Jr.\u2019s attorney on June 27, six days after Kushner updated his security clearance form to include the meeting with Veselnitskaya.\n2. WIRED reported that according to FEC filings, Trump re-election campaign has already paid out $600k to Trump-owned properties.\n3. Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, was the sole face for the Trump regime on all five of the Sunday shows.\n4. Sekulow suggested that US Secret Service would have vetted Donald Jr.\u2019s meetings. The USSS issued a statement denying they screened anyone: \u201cDonald Trump, Jr. was not a protected of the USSS in June, 2016.\u201d\n5. The US Women\u2019s Open, hosted at a Trump golf course, posted its lowest final round rating in at least 30 years. Trump had tweeted about attending the event.\n6. WSJ reported there were nearly 150k attempts to penetrate South Carolina\u2019s voter-registration system on Election Day, even though SC was not a competitive state. So far, there is evidence 21 states were targeted.\n7. TIME reported on a previously undisclosed 15-page plan produced by Obama\u2019s cybersecurity officials which shows how concerned the administration was about Russian hacking.\n8. The concern was so grave, on November 1, the Obama administration did a war-game, practice attack. Obama\u2019s NSC ran a fictional attack and rehearsed how federal agencies would communicate and respond.\n9. TIME reported concern was born over a California primary in which some voters were prevented from voting because their registrations had been altered. Russia was suspected of the hacking.\n10. A WAPO\/ABC poll showed Trump approval rating has fallen to 36% from 42% in April. His net approval fell from -11 to -22. Trump\u2019s support from Independents has fallen to 32%.\n11. A Monmouth Poll found that 41% of Americans support impeaching Trump, significantly higher than Nixon at the start of Watergate (24%).\n12. A PPP poll found 45% support impeaching Trump, and 43% are opposed.\n13. CNN tracked highlights of Trump\u2019s first six months: he passed no major legislation, held just one press conference, sent 991 tweets, golfed 40 times, and spent 21 of 26 weekends at Trump properties.\n14. Criticism of Kobach and the Election Integrity Commission continued from all sides as their first public meeting took place, with many calling it a veiled attempt at voter suppression and purging.\n15. Kobach responded to MSNBC when asked if Hillary won the popular vote, \u201cWe will probably never know the answer to that question.\u201d\n16. Daily Beast reported that Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.. Trump\u2019s air war has already killed more than 2k civilians.\n17. CREW won a legal battle to compel Trump to turn over the Mar-A-Lago visitor logs by September 8. CREW said they will make the information available to the public, when and if they receive it.\n18. Outgoing OGE chair Shaub told NYT that actions by Trump and his regime have created a historic ethics crisis. On the world stage, this has rendered US \u201cclose to the laughingstock,\u201d and it \u201caffects our credibility.\u201d\n19. DHS announced a one-time increase of 15k H-2B visas, a reversal from Trump\u2019s rhetoric as he launched Made in America Week. The change came after lobbying by industries that rely on temporary foreign workers.\n20. AP reported the Trump Organization has asked the federal government to grant dozens of special visas to allow foreign nationals to work at two of Trump\u2019s private clubs in Florida.\n21. Of note, this occurred during Trump\u2019s \u2018Made in America\u2019 week. Also of note, none of Ivanka\u2019s products are produced in the US.\n22. In a vote along party lines, the Senate confirmed political blogger John Bush, Trump\u2019s most controversial nominee yet, to the federal courts of appeal in Kentucky. Bush\u2019s blog posts disparage gays, women and people of color, and contain conspiracy theories and false information.\n23. Poland, the country chosen by Trump for a major speech en route to the G20, may be stripped of EU voting rights for the rightwing government\u2019s plan to abolish the independence of the country\u2019s judiciary.\n24. Former diplomats and national security officials urged Tillerson not to eliminate the State Dept\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM), citing \u201cprofound and negative implications\u201d of doing so.\n25. FP reported Tillerson is set to also shutter the State Dept\u2019s War Crimes Office, the office that for two decades held war criminals accountable.\n26. Christopher Painter, the top cyber diplomat, will leave his State Depart job at the end of the month. Painter has led the American delegations to international cyber meetings since 2011.\n27. US Treasury fined Exxon-Mobil $2mm, saying the company showed \u201creckless disregard\u201d for Russian sanctions while Tillerson was CEO.\n28. House Republicans will seek to defund the Election Assistance Commission, the only federal agency that exclusively works to ensure the voting process is secure.\n29. The defunding comes as the Election Assistance Commission is working with the FBI to examine an attack late last year on the agency\u2019s computer systems by a Russian hacker.\n30. Manafort filed reports with the DOJ showing his firm received nearly $17mm for two years of work for a Ukrainian political party with links to the Kremlin \u2014 more than the party\u2019s operations reported spending.\n31. Manhattan\u2019s DA office subpoenaed Federal Savings Bank, a Chicago bank run by Steve Calk, for records on a $16mm in loans made to Manafort in November and January. At the time, Manafort was underwater on loans to a Brooklyn townhouse and a family investment in CA properties.\n32. The loans to Manafort represent 24% of the bank\u2019s reported $67 million of equity capital. Calk was a member of Trump\u2019s economic advisory panel, and had expressed interest in becoming Army Secretary.\n33. On Tuesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Rybakov said the Russian government is \u201calmost\u201d at a deal to get their seized compounds returned.\n34. On Tuesday, Trump again tweeted his demand that the Senate must change its rules to make repealing Obamacare easier.\n35. In a memo sent to station news directors, Sinclair\u2019s VP of News defended the company from charges of being biased. In Week 35, Sinclair has mandated segments by Trump ally Epshteyn.\n36. Sessions said he would be issuing a new directive aimed at increasing police seizures of cash and property.\n37. Sen Paul called on Sessions to stop, tweeting, \u201cAsset forfeiture is an unconstitutional taking of property without trial.\u201d\n38. After Republicans failed in their repeal and replace, and then failed again at repeal, Trump said Republicans should \u201clet Obamacare fail,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m not going to own it.\u201d\n39. CNN reported Trump aides could face scrutiny by Mueller over their role in strategizing with Trump to craft the initial statement issued by Donald Jr. as the NYT story broke about the June 9 meeting.\n40. AP reported that according to Akhmetshin, Veselnitskaya brought a plastic folder with printed-out documents thought to be damaging to Clinton to the meeting with Donald Jr., Kushner and Manafort.\n41. WAPO reported the eighth person in the Donald Jr.\/Veselnitskaya meeting was Ike Kaveladze, who attended as a representative of Aras and Emin Agalarov.\n42. Kaveladze\u2019s attorney said he had received a phone call over the weekend from a representative of Mueller, asking to set up an interview.\n43. Kaveladze was once the focus of a Congressional money laundering probe involving Russian oligarchs.\n44. On an interview with Charlie Rose, Ian Bremmer said Trump and Putin had a second hour-long private meeting on sidelines of the G20.\n45. Trump\u2019s WH was forced to confirm the meeting Tuesday, as reports surfaced that some guests had been surprised that it occurred.\n46. Trump\u2019s WH sought to minimize the disclosure, claiming in a statement the private meeting was \u201cjust a brief conversation at the end of dinner.\u201d Spicer said of the meeting, \u201cIt was pleasantries and small talk.\u201d\n47. Daily Beast reported that after being sent a secret document by officials in Moscow in April 2016, GOP Rep Rohrabacher, a long-time Russia advocate, aimed to alter the Magnitsky Act.\n48. Without stated rationale, Trump ended a covert CIA program to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels battling al-Assad, a victory for Russia.\n49. The day after a shocking announcing he had been diagnosed with brain cancer, McCain issued a statement condemning the Trump\u2019s action in Syria, saying this is, \u201cplaying right into the hands of Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n50. Reuters reported that Russia says it is in talk with the US to create a cyber security working group.\n51. Trump gave a bizarre, wide-ranging interview to the NYT, which made it apparent he believes he is accountable to no one, and has full control over who occupies positions of power.\n52. Trump said he would never have hired Sessions if he knew he would recuse himself from the Trump-Russia probe. Expectations for Sessions resignation followed, but Sessions said he would stay on.\n53. Trump started to diminish Deputy AG Rosenstein for appointing a special prosecutor, saying, \u201cThere are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any. So, he\u2019s from Baltimore.\u201d\n54. On the topic of his private conversation with Putin at the G20, Trump repeated Donald Jr. initial false claim: \u201cWe talked about Russian adoption. Yeah. I always found that interesting.\u201d\n55. Trump also claimed he spoke to Putin because he was seated next to the First Lady of Japan, and didn\u2019t have a Japanese language interpreter. Videos surfaced of Akie Abe speaking fluent English.\n56. Trump also opened the door for firing Mueller, saying the special prosecutor would cross a red line if investigations delve into Trump family finances unrelated to Russia.\n57. Bloomberg reported Mueller has expanded the probe into Trump\u2019s businesses ties to Russia, including Russian purchases of apartments in Trump buildings, Trump SoHo, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, and Trump\u2019s sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch.\n58. Mueller\u2019s team is also absorbing the money laundering probe of Manafort, started by federal prosecutors in New York.\n59. WSJ reported the Senate and House Intel Comm are also investigating Manafort for possible money laundering. The Senate committee received reports by the Treasury Depart\u2019s FinCen unit which track Russian ties.\n60. Manafort has borrowed and spent tens of millions of dollars over the past decade to finance real estate purchases in Brooklyn, NY and CA.\n61. NYT reported Deutsche Bank is under investigation by regulators for their lending relationship with Trump. The bank is also likely to have to provide information to Mueller as part of the Trump-Russia probe.\n62. As per Week 19, Deutsche Bank recently paid a $630mm settlement over charges of laundering $10bn for Russia from the bank\u2019s Moscow office.\n63. In the past six years, Deutsche\u2019s private wealth area financed three Trump deals, lending $300mm. \n64. The commercial real estate area, which would typically lend for such transactions, would not finance the deals. It is also highly unusual for a private wealth area to lend such a high dollar amount.\n65. NYT also reported that Deutsche Bank was the referenced European financial institution that had partnered with Russia\u2019s Prevezon, the massive money laundering tax fraud mentioned in Week 35.\n66. Prevezon\u2019s case was settled by Sessions\u2019s DOJ two days before trial.\n67. AP reported Trump repeated overtures towards Russia are increasingly putting him at odds with his national security and foreign policy advisers. The second meeting with Putin at the G20 exacerbated the rift.\n68. AP reported it was highly unusual for only Tillerson, but not McMaster to have attended the meeting with Putin at the G20. McMaster has been warning Trump that Putin is not to be trusted.\n69. The legal team defending Trump in the Russia probe had a shake-up on Thursday, with long-time personal attorney Kasowitz leaving. Mark Corrallo, a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s legal team also resigned.\n70. Spicer resigned Friday after Trump appointed New York financier Anthony Scaramucci to communications director. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was named his replacement.\n71. Senators Cardin and Warren have pushed for an investigation into whether Scaramucci\u2019s company, SkyBridge Capital, violated sanctions against Russia.\n72. On Friday following Spicer\u2019s resignation, Sanders held an on-camera press briefing, the first one since June 29 (22 days ago).\n73. Breaking from Trump, CIA Director Pompeo, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, and WH Homeland and Counterterrorism adviser Bossert said they believe Russia meddled in our election.\n74. Reuters reported Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Jr., had Russian spy agency FSB as a client.\n75. After interviewing Susan Rice as part of the Senate Intel Comm, Republican chairman Burr commented, \u201cThe unmasking thing was all created by Devin Nunes.\u201d\n76. Michael Flynn opened a new consulting firm, Resilient Patriot, LLC. Flynn\u2019s new firm will advise private equity firms. \n77. Trump named a temporary director, Apol, to replace Shaub as head of the OGE as he seeks a permanent director. Watchdogs groups expressed concern that Trump bypassed Shaub\u2019s designated successor, Finlayson. \n78. WAPO reported some of Trump\u2019s lawyers are exploring ways to limit or undercut Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia probe, building a case around alleged conflicts of interest of Mueller and his staff.\n79. Sekulow said Mueller investigating Trump\u2019s business dealings, including transactions like a Russian oligarch\u2019s purchase of Trump\u2019s Palm Beach mansion, \u201cis far outside the scope of a legitimate investigation.\u201d\n80. WAPO also reported Trump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides, family members and himself.\n81. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intel Comm, warned Trump that pardoning targets of the Russia probe would be \u201ccrossing a fundamental line.\u201d\n82. Trump loyalist Newt Gingrich told FoxNews Friday, \u201cThe Mueller investigation has so many conflicts of interests, it\u2019s almost an absurdity.\u201d \n83. A New Republic op-ed titled, \u201cWe\u2019re on the Brink of an Authoritarian Crisis, cited Trump\u2019s NYT interview, information on efforts to attack Mueller and questions about issuing pardons, as cause for concern.\n84. WAPO reported Kislyak told his superiors he discussed campaign-related matters, including policy issues important to Moscow, with Sessions. The conversations were intercepted by US spy agencies.\n85. In March, Sessions had said he never had meetings with Russian operatives or intermediaries about the Trump campaign. He also lied under oath during the Senate confirmation hearings about the meetings.\n86. WAPO reported Sessions had three meetings with Kislyak including at his Senate office in September, at the Republican National Convention in July, and at the Mayflower Hotel in April.\n87. Kushner agreed to testify in front of the Senate Intel Comm next Monday, and the House Intel Comm on Tuesday.\n88. Bypassing Tillerson and the State Dept after a contentious meeting, Trump assigned a WH team of loyalists to review the Iran Nuclear Deal and give him the option to say Tehran was not in compliance.\n89. WAPO reported late Friday that Kushner filed a revised financial disclosure form, showing he had failed to disclose dozens of financial holdings that he was required to declare when he joined the WH.\n90. Of note, Kushner had failed to disclose a $285mm loan that his company received from Deutsche Bank one month before the election. \n91. A separate form filed Friday showed Ivanka has personally profited by as much as $5mm since Trump took office from her outside businesses, despite a promise to distance herself from her private holdings.\n92. Also late Friday, a deal between Donald Jr., Manafort and the Senate Judiciary Comm was announced, in which the two will provide records and be interviewed in a closed-door session to avoid being subpoenaed.\n93. On Saturday morning, starting at 6:30 a.m EST, Trump sent a bizarre litany of tweets on topics ranging from his usual trashing of the media, Hillary and Comey, to the topic of pardons and Mueller. \n94. Trump continued to tweet, despite a new ABC\/WAPO poll that showed 67% of Americans disapprove of his using Twitter, including 68% saying his tweets were inappropriate, and half said his tweets were dangerous. \n95. Saturday, in a repudiation of Trump, Congress reached a deal on sweeping sanctions to punish Russia for election-meddling. The legislation will limit Trump\u2019s ability to suspend or terminate sanctions.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Amy_Siskind\/status\/888861746362023936"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1500760777,"title":"Five poll numbers that should make Democrats uneasy","num_comments":3,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1500760848,"title":"The Media MUST Fight Back","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1500763524,"title":"Trump officially nominates climate-denying conservative talk radio host as USDA\u2019s top scientist","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1500776358,"title":"Justice Department\u2019s Demand for Extreme Secrecy in Reality Winner Trial Shows How Snowden Would Be Railroaded If He Returned To The United States","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Alfred3000","created_utc":1500778634,"title":"What would you ditch to keep or get rid of President Trump","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"pheonix200","created_utc":1500779756,"title":"Schumer: Dems, not Russia, are to blame for loss to Trump","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"rieslingatkos","created_utc":1500786400,"title":"Trump again seeking foreign workers for Mar-a-Lago","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"rieslingatkos","created_utc":1500793938,"title":"How Japan has almost eradicated gun crime","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1500794474,"title":"No, Trump's Base And The Republican Party Aren't Two Separate Things","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1500806324,"title":"Leftwing Breitbart?

I just made an accidental discovery while making a few twitter bots.\n\nBack Story:\n\nOk, so one day while I was at work, I decided I wanted to make a twitter bot.  I am a Computer Science student and have a pretty good amount of knowledge about software development.  So I sat down and made a few twitter bots that each did different tasks.  Later I decided to make a twitter bot that sent a tweet to every Donald Trump follower with a funny meme and a message that said \"Vote Bernie\".  So I did some research on the twitter API and found that if I started gathering his twitter followers it would take me about 390 days to get them all.  This is due to the amount of times you can get info from their servers every 15 minutes.  So I just decided to gather about 20,000 of them.  After the bot worked all night and ha;f the next day, I finally stopped gathering and started sending memes.  I sent them in 15 tweet bursts and I checked the bot account to see if it was working.  What I found was weird. About 11 out of the 15 accounts it tweeted at didn't have any tweets, likes, reply's, or even a profile picture... Weird.  So I set up a program that checked if the accounts I stored in a list had any data or not.  (Meaning didn't return \"[ ]\").  I then found out that out of the 20,166 accounts I pulled, 10,287 of them were blank accounts.  There were also 1,053 accounts that were \"Unauthorized Accounts\".  Again, I am not making any conclusions about this but I find it very strange that over half the accounts I pulled were blank. (DT has 33.7 million followers)  Comment about this and I will continue to do more research and testing of more accounts and add to my post!!!\n\nThanks!!!"},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1500835404,"title":"Sanders Keeping Door Open On 2020","num_comments":20,"description":""},{"author":"HondaAnnaconda","created_utc":1500836760,"title":"The Gentrification-to-Prison Pipeline - written by prisoner from Detroit doing hard time","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1500837225,"title":"huck Schumer owns up to Democratic Party mistakes before unveiling new economic platform","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1500837812,"title":"Hey, Donald!

I read it carefully, and it seems to be saying that because they are not the traditional base (old black women) we can ignore them.\n\nWe do that at our own peril. Speaking as a Bernie supporter who was a \"Hillary Girl\" in 2008, remember that very few of us voted against Hillary. A small sliver went to third parties or to Trump, and some just stayed home, but most of us held our nose and voted for the lesser of two evils.\n\nWe are still angry over what the DNC did to Bernie and I personally believe the conspiracy against him went much further. When polls show him winning a state by several points and exit polls and early voting shows him leading, then he loses by several points -- what would you think if the shoe was on the other foot? I think you would think what you do about those 70 some-odd thousand votes that elected Trump - that something doesn't smell right.\n\nDo not make the mistake of thinking that Berners are not watching very carefully. We will not support candidates who are just Hillary clones or worse. We didn't want Hillary and we don't want another corporate democrat. \n\nPay particular attention to women voters. This was played down, but there were a shitton of women who only voted for Hillary to get the first woman president.

Here's week 37:\n(July 29, 2017) - \u00a9 2017 Amy Siskind\nThis was a week of complete disarray within the Trump regime: firings, resignations, withdrawals. Trump distracted and played to his remaining base all week by targeting marginalized groups, and ramping up hateful rhetoric\n\nAlso of note, and a continuation from Week 36: Republicans are turning on Trump - this week, not just in words this week, but in actions. And in response, by firing Priebus and replacing him with a general, Trump seems to be preparing for an aggressive approach towards the legislative branch.\n\n1. On Sunday, Trump\u2019s comm director Scaramucci told State of the Union Trump is still not sure if Russia interfered in our election. This, just after Pompei, Coats and Dunford confirmed Russia meddled (Week 36). \n2. As Trump floated the idea of firing Mueller, Former CIA director Brennan said elected officials need to \u201cstand up\u201d if this happens. \n3. After Trump said, \u201cwe\u2019ll let Obamacare fail,\u201d Trump has taken several steps to sabotage ACA, and make that a reality. \n4. Since taking office, Trump has spent nearly 1 in 3 days at a Trump property, and 1 in 5 days at a Trump golf property.\n5. CNBC reported investors have dumped the majority of \u2018Trump trades.\u2019 Investors are no longer confident tax reform, deregulation and fiscal stimulus will happen.\n6. New Yorker interviewed a veteran ICE agent, disillusioned under Trump. The agent said they are explicitly encouraged to pursue undocumented as aggressively as possible, adding \u201cWe\u2019re going to get sued.\u201d\n7. He also noted agents no longer look at the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d and that it\u2019s not just the person being removed, but \u201ctheir entire family.\u201d\n8. Several people were arrested by ICE at the Houston INS office when they went for their marriage interviews for green cards.\n9. Pew Research found that 75% of Muslim Americans believe there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims in the US, and 74% believe Trump is unfriendly towards them.\n10. Thousands marched in Warsaw to protest their right-wing government\u2019s attempted control of the Supreme Court and judiciary. Trump chose Poland en route to the G20 to deliver a nationalistic speech (Week 34). \n11. On Monday, Trump continued to signal the possibility of firing Sessions, referring to him in a tweet as \u201cour beleaguered A.G.\u201d \n12. Trump floated the idea of Rudy Giuliani as a replacement for Sessions. WAPO reported replacing Sessions is viewed by some Trump associates as part of a possible strategy to fire Mueller.\n13. Trump continued to target Sessions on Tuesday, tweeting he \u201chas taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes,\u201d and asking on a phone call with an associate, \u201cWhat would happen if I fired Sessions?\u201d\n14. Trump continued attacking Sessions on Twitter Wednesday, questioning why he hadn\u2019t fired acting FBI director McCabe.\n15. WAPO reported Trump spoke privately with confidants and advisers about the possibility of replacing Sessions with a recess appointment.\n16. Grassley responded tweeting the agenda for the Senate Judiciary Comm is set for the rest of 2017, and would not have time for an AG nomination. Democrats threatened to block recess appointments.\n17. Breaking their typical silence, several Senate Republicans spoke out against Trump\u2019s treatment of their former colleague, Sessions. Sen Roberts (KS) said, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, it\u2019s disconcerting, it\u2019s inexplicable.\u201d\n18. Sessions told Fox News that Trump\u2019s attacks are \u201ckind of hurtful,\u201d but that he intended to stay on and serve as long as Trump will let him.\n19. In an op-ed, Yates warned Trump is trying to \u201cdismantle the rule of law, destroy the time-honored independence\u201d of the DOJ, and if we\u2019re not careful, \u201cour justice system may be broken beyond recognition.\u201d\n20. Yates cited as examples Trump\u2019s efforts to bully Sessions into resigning, his goading Sessions to re-opening an investigation on a former political rival, and his efforts to get Comey to back off from Flynn then firing him.\n21. NYT reported David Apol, Trump\u2019s choice to replace Shaub, has clashed with OGE employees over his efforts to roll back or loosen ethics requirements on federal employees, including those in the WH.\n22. The Center for Public Integrity reported Bannon is potentially violating the Antideficiency Act, by using an outside shadow press office not employed by the Trump regime, and providing services for free.\n23. In another blow to the credibility of Trump\u2019s Election Integrity Comm, a federal judge upheld a fine against Kobach, citing a \u201cpattern\u201d of \u201cmisleading the Court\u201d in voter-ID cases.\n24. A lawyer in West Palm Beach filed a lawsuit with a federal judge in FL, saying Trump is violating the Constitution by making money from renting rooms in his hotels or other buildings to federal agencies.\n25. According to Gallup, Trump\u2019s approval in underwater in 11 of the states he won in November, including NC (-11), MI (-10), WI (-9) and PA (-9).\n26. Trump\u2019s Boy Scouts jamboree speech turned into a political rally, as Trump led the crowd to boo Hillary and Obama, chided the \u201cfake news\u201d and Washington \u201ccesspool,\u201d and promised to bring back Christmas.\n27. Boy Scouts of America faced a backlash after Trump\u2019s speech, which some compared to Hitler\u2019s Youth. Former scouts called for a public denouncement, and called the speech \u201ca disgrace.\u201d\n28. Randall Stephenson, the national president of the Boy Scouts of America is also CEO of AT&T, whose pending merger with Time Warner requires government approval. In Week 34, the Trump regime discussed using this pending merger as leverage over CNN\u2019s reporting and president. 29. The day after reporting on Stephenson\u2019s role as CEO of AT&T, the Chief Scout Executive for the Boy Scouts of America issued an apology. \n30. After the State Dept\u2019s Cyber Coordinator resigned (Week 36), Tillerson plans to shutter the State\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Cyber Issues.\n31. The State Dept\u2019s head of diplomatic security bureau, Bill Miller, resigned. Miller is one of a long list of senior State Dept officials who have resigned since Trump took office.\n32. CNN reported Tillerson is considering resigning, citing his frustration and doubt that \u201cthe tug-of-war\u201d with the WH would subside. Tillerson is also upset about Trump\u2019s unprofessional treatment of Sessions. \n33. Many of State Dept\u2019s typical responsibilities have been re-assigned to the WH in a consolidation of power, including Kushner taking the Middle East, and in Week 36, the WH taking over Iran compliance certification.\n34. On Tuesday, Tillerson said he would taking time off. The State Dept refused to comment on if he is happy.\n35. Longtime chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell criticized the lack of transparency from and access to Trump\u2019s State Dept.\n36. Speculation grew that McMaster may resign. POLITICO reported on a meeting on Afghan policy, described as a \u201cs*** show.\u201d Axios reported McMaster is frustrated by the \u201cdisorganization and indiscipline.\u201d\n37. Scaramucci threatened mass firings, saying he will purge aides who are not loyal to Trump or leak. His first firing happened Tuesday: assistant press secretary Michael Short, who is close to Priebus and Spicer.\n38. Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the DOJ\u2019s criminal division, Brian Benczkowski, disclosed to Congress that he previously represented Alfa Bank, one of Russia\u2019s financial institutions, whose owners have close ties to Putin.\n39. The FBI is investigating data transmission between Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization\u2019s servers during the election, which may indicate back-channel communications.\n40. Benczkowski took on representing Alfa Bank after serving as part of Trump\u2019s transition team. He continued despite reports of the FBI investigation (Week 21), and continued until his nomination in June.\n41. A complaint filed by the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control alleges Trump ally Rohrbacher violated the Magnitsky Act by trying to get Russia\u2019s deputy general prosecutor removed from the US sanctions list.\n42. Ahead of his Monday, closed-door testimony to the Senate Intel Comm, Kushner publicly released the full text of his testimony in which he denied participating in, or knowledge about, collusion with Russia.\n43. After his Senate testimony, the WH set up a podium with the White House seal for Kushner to make his statement to the media.\n44. Kushner stood at the podium and said, \u201cI did not collude,\u201d nor did he know anyone in the campaign who did. He said his actions were \u201cproper and occurred in the normal course of events of a very unique campaign.\u201d\n45. On the June 9 Trump Tower meeting with Russians, Kushner claimed he was unaware of the promise of damaging information, despite the email subject line: \u201cRe: Russia \u2014 Clinton \u2014 private and confidential.\u201d \n46. Kushner claimed he met with four Russians but did not discuss specific policies, including US sanctions against Russia.\n47. Kushner also said, \u201cI have not relied on Russian funds for my businesses.\u201d \u2018Relied\u2019 seemed a carefully chosen term for its possibility to obfuscate. \n48. Guardian reported Kushner bought part of the old New York Times building from a Russian oligarch, Lev Leviev, known as the \u201cking of diamonds,\u201d for $295mm in 2015.\n49. Kushner\u2019s recently disclosed $285mm loan from Deutsche Bank was used to refinance this deal. The purchase is part of Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump-Russia ties.\n50. Leviev also sold properties to Prevezon, the Russian company represented by Veselnitskaya: apartments at 20 Pine Street in NYC. The property was subject to a money laundering case.\n51. The Prevezon money laundering case, originally brought by Bharara for $230mm before he was fired, was settled by Sessions two days before trial for $6mm. The 20 Pine Street apartments were also released.\n52. Mother Jones reported on Monday, former senator Carl Levin sent a letter to Mueller about his 2000 investigation of Kaveladze, who he described as a \u201cposter child\u201d for Russian money laundering. \n53. Levin said Kaveladze circulated more than $1.4bn through US bank accounts. Kaveladze was Aras Agalarov\u2019s representative at Donald Jr.\u2019s June 9 Trump Tower meeting.\n54. Ivanka hired a defense lawyer to represent her in the Russia investigation. Donald Jr. hired an additional lawyer with congressional experience to his legal team.\n55. On Tuesday, Manafort testified in front of the Senate Intel Comm on the June 9 meeting at Trump Tower. Tuesday, he was also subpoenaed by the Senate Judiciary Comm to appear.\n56. On Tuesday, Kushner testified behind closed doors for the House Intel Comm. Democratic leader Schiff said Kushner had agreed to come back.\n57. On Thursday, Bill Browder, founder and CEO of Hermitage Capital Management which was looted by Russian kleptocrats in a case that gave rise to the Magnitsky Act, testified in front of the Sen Judiciary Comm.\n58. Browder testified he believed there was more than one meeting between Veselnitskaya and Donald Jr., Kushner and Manafort, and that Veselnitskaya\u2019s goal would be to repeal the Magnitsky Act.\n59. Browder also testified that Russian intelligence knew about the June 9 meeting in advance, and that he believes Fusion GPS \u2014 the firm behind the Russian dossier to get dirt on Trump \u2014 was hired by the Russians.\n60. On Tuesday, by a vote of 419\u20133, the House passed a Russian sanctions bill, punishing Russia for election interference, and curbing Trump\u2019s power to roll back sanctions.\n61. Russia warned of a \u201cpainful\u201d response if Trump backed the sanction bill, calling it \u201canti-Russian hysteria.\u201d\n62. Weekly Standard reported their interview with Vladimir Kara-Mirza, a Russian journalist, politician and filmmaker, started late because he was in the hospital being treated for poison, again.\n63. Buzzfeed filed a lawsuit to compel the release of information on the death of Putin\u2019s former media czar, Mikhail Lesin, who was brutally murdered in DC the night before a planned meeting with DOJ in November 2015.\n64. The Senate passed a motion to proceed on healthcare Tuesday with no input, no debate, no CBO score, and without knowing what they would be voting on once the motion passed. 13% support Obamacare repeal. \n65. The vote was 50\u201350, with Pence casting the tie-breaking vote. After the passage, uncharacteristic chants erupted on the Senate floor of \u201ckill the bill,\u201d and \u201cshame, shame, shame.\u201d \n66. Ahead of the vote, reporters were blocked from the Senate halls where protestors were being arrested. Reporters were told, \u201cno photos. Delete your photos.\u201d\n67. A hot mic in the Senate captured a conversation between senators Reed and Collins, with Reed saying of Trump, \u201cI think \u2014 I think he\u2019s crazy,\u201d and Collins responding, \"I\u2019m worried.\u201d\n68. Trump's s actions have galvanized many who care about health care, climate change and research funding to run for office. A PAC called \u201c314 ACT\u201d (named for pi) was set up to recruit and assist scientists to run.\n69. At a rally in Ohio Tuesday, Trump said he could act more presidential than any other president except, \u201cthe late, great Abraham Lincoln.\u201d He also joked he should be on Mount Rushmore.\n70. Trump also told a graphic tale about illegal immigrants slicing up beautiful teenage girls with knives, \u201cThey don\u2019t want to use guns because it\u2019s too fast and it\u2019s not painful enough.\u201d The story is a lie.\n71. WAPO reported between the Ohio and Boy Scout rally, Trump made 29 false or misleading statements. \n72. On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted the US government would \u201cwill not accept or allow\u2026Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\u201d\n73. The Pentagon was not informed of Trump\u2019s announcement ahead of time, and was left scrambling with no plan in place for implementation, including how to deal with transgender individuals now serving.\n74. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees were also not notified. The committees were awaiting results from a 6 month review of potential impact ordered by Mattis in Week 33.\n75. On Thursday, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instructed the military policy on who is allowed to serve would not change until the WH sends DoD new rules and the secretary of defense issues new guidelines.\n76. Mattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted. According to the NYT, he was given only one day\u2019s notice about the decision, and per people close to him, was appalled that Trump used Twitter for the announcement. \n77. Even Republicans spoke out against Trump\u2019s plan to ban transgender individuals. Conservative Sen Hatch said, \u201cTransgender people are people, and deserve the best we can do for them.\u201d\n78. Trump\u2019s candidate for a senior position at the DHS, John Fluharty, withdrew from consideration because of Trump\u2019s transgender ban. \n79. Wednesday, in a second attack on the LGBTQ community, Sessions\u2019s DOJ filed a brief saying that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not cover employment discrimination \u201cbased on sexual orientation.\u201d\n80. Rep Farenthold said of \u201csome female senators from the Northeast\u201d who were against an Obamacare repeal, if they were a guy from south Texas, \u201cI might ask him to step outside and settle this Aaron Burr-style.\u201d\n81. Wednesday, Trump chastised Sen Murkowski tweeting she had let the Republicans and country down by not voting to repeal Obamacare. \n82. Later that afternoon, Interior Sec Ryan Zinke called both of Alaska\u2019s senators, saying Murkowski\u2019s vote would impact the Trump\u2019s administrations view on issues that are a priority for Alaska.\n83. Of note, all during the week, Republican men insulted and threatened their female colleagues for not supporting their healthcare bills. Male senators not in support did not face the same harassment. \n84. Graham said Thursday, \u201cthere will be holy hell to pay\u201d if Trump fires Sessions, and said if Trump fires Mueller without good reason, it would be \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n85. Later that day, Graham and Booker said they will introduce a bi-partisan bill next week that will limit Trump\u2019s ability to fire Mueller. \n86. On Wednesday night, Scaramucci accused Priebus of leaking his financial disclosure information, and said he would be contacting the FBI. Shortly after POLITICO indicated the information is public, he deleted the tweet.\n87. Scaramucci gave an interview to The New Yorker Thursday, saying of his colleagues, \u201cReince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock.\u201d\n88. Scaramucci also threatened leakers, saying, \u201cWhat I want to do is I want to fucking kill all the leakers.\u201d \n89. Later that evening, Scaramucci tried to shift the blame to the reporter, tweeting, \u201cI made a mistake in trusting in a reporter,\u201d but Lizza shot back saying he had a recording of the call which was \u201c100% on the record.\u201d\n90. On Thursday, the Senate passed a new sanction bill by a 98\u20132 vote, which would sharply limit Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to suspend or lift sanctions on Russia. With House and Senate passage, the bill now goes to Trump.\n91. On Friday, Russia retaliated, expelling a large number of US diplomats and seizing US diplomatic properties. \n92. Late Friday, the WH announced Trump plans to sign the bill. \n93. Trump encouraged officers to be rough with suspects in a speech to police Friday on Long Island, addressing the gang MS-13.\n94. Trump also used the speech to encourage Congress to find money to pay for 10k more ICE officers \u201cso that we can eliminate MS-13.\u201d\n95. After the speech, the Suffolk County PD tweeted, \u201cAs a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners.\u201d\n96. Later that evening, a second police department, Gainevilles Police (FL), also rejected Trump\u2019s remarks, citing \u201cThe @POTUS made remarks today that endorsed and condoned police brutality.\u201d\n97. The International Association of Chiefs of Police issued a statement Friday night countering Trump, saying officers are trained to treat all individuals \u201cwith dignity and respect.\u201d\n98. After all other versions of Senate healthcare bills failed, late Friday, the Senate voted on the \u201cSkinny Repeal.\u201d An 8-page copy of the bill was provided to Democrats at 10 pm Friday night, ahead of a midnight vote.\n99. The night prior, GOP senators Johnson, Graham and Cassidy announced they would only vote for the \u201cSkinny Repeal\u201d if House Republicans assured them that it would never become law. Still the vote proceeded.\n100. Ahead of the vote, Enzi filibustered the Senate floor for an hour. Democrats tried to interrupt and ask questions. Enzi told Murray, \u201cPerhaps your time might be better spent taking a look at the bill.\u2019\n101. At 1:30 am Friday morning, after over an hour spent by Pence and other Republicans to change McCain\u2019s mind, the Skinny Repeal bill was voted down 49\u201351: Collins, Murkowski and McCain voted with Democrats. \n102. After the failed vote, at 2:25 am, Trump tweeted, \u201clet ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!\u201d\n103. Trump also again pushed for the Republicans to end the legislative filibuster, a long-time norm in the Senate, so bills can pass with 51 votes.\n104. Trump unceremoniously fired Priebus, informing press and staff shortly after Air Force One landed in DC. WSJ reported that part of Trump\u2019s rationale was that Priebus did not fire back at Scaramucci.\n105. Priebus served the shortest time of any chief of staff in a president\u2019s first term since WW2.\n106. The WSJ Editorial Board excoriated Trump over the Priebus firing, writing \u201cthis shuffling of the staff furniture won\u2019t matter unless Mr. Trump accepts that the White House problem isn\u2019t Mr. Priebus. It\u2019s him.\u201d\n107. WAPO tracked the Trump regime\u2019s unusually long list of firings, resignations, and withdrawals from consideration. Trump also has far less appointed and confirmed candidates for key executive roles.\n108. Trump appointed General John Kelly, current Secretary of DHS. Kelly little political and legislative experience. One Ryan-Priebus ally said the next phase of Trump presidency will be warfare against GOP Congress.\n109. On Saturday morning, Trump tweeted attacks Republicans, saying they \u201clook like fools\u201d and that Democrats \u201care laughing at R\u2019s.\u201d\n110. Trump also commanded Republicans to change norms: \u201cRepublican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW!\u201d and he threatened if healthcare did not pass, he would end \u201cBAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress.\u201d\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Amy_Siskind\/status\/891374080141733889\n"},{"author":"Kinglens311","created_utc":1501437133,"title":"Experts in authoritarianism advise to keep a list of things subtly changing around you, so you\u2019ll remember.

Body shaming.\n\nTo stay away from circumstantial evidence I am going to point to the media. Both journalists like Joy Ann Reid\/Rachel Maddow(if they still count as journalists) and especially liberal comedians like Stephen Colbert\/Trevor Noah will rip to shreds and humiliate anyone who makes fun of a trans person or bullies a fat kid or body shames a woman. Then they will turn around and literally in the very next segment make fun of Trumps small hands\/small penis even though that shames countless other people who have done nothing wrong. Part of the POINT of calling out body shaming is because no matter how horrendous a person is or what they have done, their body\/culture and other aspects of their life are shared by thousands, millions or billions of others! By shaming a crap excuse for a human with a body issue instead of the facts you shame EVERYONE with that issue.  \n\nTrump is not alone in his tiny hands, nor are numerous other small minded\/evil people in having a big nose or dopey ears or looking like turtles. We liberals cant be taken seriously on body shaming or bullying when we are showing the EXACT same behavior in making fun of Republicans for issues like those regardless of who it smears. \n\nI know i am not the first one to make this observation, so not thinking I am brilliant here or anything. But from the far left like Jimmy Dore and the Young Turks to liberals who might as well be conservatives like Hillary Clinton or Samantha B, we are letting waaaaaaaay too many people not only be hypocrites, but also even profit off the hypocrisy(t shirts, fundraising etc). \n\nThis all reflects badly on Democrats. IMO its actually worse on our part since at leasts cons have the excuse of being born with oversized amygdalas.

The problem with the Democratic primary is that the deep south has so much power even though it is totally irrelevant in the general election. It's pretty much structurally set up that the African American candidate wins. Now, before you leave an angry comment, I'm quite a fan of Obama and think he was a fantastic candidate. Booker is very different though and not a good nationwide candidate no matter how much you like him. The issue isn't that he is black, the issue is that he has no idea how to talk to the white working class (who the Democrats need to secure at least a segment of to win). Obama knew how to connect with these people and didn't have a reputation (like Booker does) for being entrenched in identity politics and coastal elitism. Booker is disliked by the left, white workers AND soft-conservatives who may have flipped in 2016, he could lose spectacularly.

First of all, the term \"alt left\" is a lie and a false equivalency. This term originates to Donald Trump's alt right movement which is considered white nationalist and almost neo nazi. That's a pretty rough equivalency. Comparing those who want medicare for all to neo nazis of all people. However, here's why it's a lie. To marginalize and smear progressives as the equivalent to the alt right is false because a large majority of Democratic voters best align with those of progressive democratic politicians. Policies such as medicare for all, tuition free college, ending the interventionist wars, raising the minimum wage, an environmental revolution, universal basic income, and so on best represent a large amount of democratic voters rather then just a marginal alternative side of the party. The problem in my opinion is those certain personalities are the ones who benefit most from having a more conservative politician win over more left wing politicians. For example, right now on Twitter, certain news and political personalities like Joy Reid, Sally Albright, and Neera Tanden are smearing presidential candidate Bernie Sanders as an \"alt left sexist\" and that other candidates like Kamala Harris or Hillary Clinton would be better candidates for election. They've even gone as far to say that Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is pro Syria just because she said that US regime-change intervention in Syria's civil war is a source of the Syrian refugee crisis and met with President Bashar al-Assad during a secret trip to Syria. I asked some of my democratic friends online about this and one thing I heard was \"well of course she's pro Syria, she had no right to meet with Assad\" even though the trip was approved by the House Ethics Committee and she disapproved of most of Assad's wrong doings. Tulsi Gabbard is a phenomenal congresswomen and as a life long Democrat, it makes me sick to see good politicians who want to help lower wage earning Americans be smeared in such a way. Yeah sure Bernie technically isn't a Democrat but I guarantee he'd register as Democrat if he won the presidency. In conclusion, the term alt left is nothing more then a smear towards FDR style Democrats who don't take corporate money.

However, the Democrats as a party have done a very poor job of countering Republican rhetoric.  There are two areas where they have failed miserably:\n\na) The average American is convinced that the government couldn't manage a lemonade stand efficiently.  Since the Government needs to be heavily involved in most Democratic policies, that makes the policies look bad.\n\nb) The Democrats have let the Republicans demonize a lot of words related to liberal concepts.  The substance of the policies are lost when they are full of \"trigger words\" that starts the emotions flowing in the average American.\n\nThere are two things I thinkthat they could do still to counteract this stuff:\n\na) Make Governmental Efficiency a pivotal part of their platform, not only in name, but in practice.  Get some millionaire\/billionaire democrat businessmen talking about integrating business tactics into Government agencies to make them leaner, reduce red tape, increase quality of service, etc.  Try to make the point that there's nothing inherently preventing Government from being less efficient than companies as long as you set up systems to encourage\/discourage behavior similar to a free market.  And be persistent about it!  It should be a main focal point of the platform for a long time to come.\n\nb) Create advertisements for TV, internet, etc that champion some of the more advanced policies like Universal Healthcare and UBI.  The point isn't to advertise for the Democratic party, it's to make Americans comfortable with the idea and benefits of the more social policies.  Ideally, a superpac or non-Democrat-specific organization should do this.  I want to see a Cialis-like ad about an ex-Coal Miner in 2023 telling his daughter how UBI saved their family and allowed him to gain new skills to compete in a modern job market without anyone going hungry, and that the daughter will never have to worry about losing her house if she wants to chase her dream of being a Veterinarian.   Another ad with a couple of friends drinking coffee talking about how they don't know how they'll be able to pay their mother's medical bills, adding how Cousin So-And-So had a similar thing happen in the UK, but it was all paid for.  In general, keep it lite and don't preach.  Just say \"UBI is good (happy children)\", \"UH works (no stress)\", \"Alternative energy is cheaper (cute puppies)\", etc.  The idea isn't necessarily to win people's minds with well thought out argument, it's to add some emotions towards these subjects so that when people talk about it, they're instinct is that it saves coal miner's daughters, not that it's a sign of the apocalypse.\n\nIn general, highlighting efficiency attacks the real backbone of the Republican platform, and advertising counters their greatest tool of fear through ignorance.   \n\nThoughts?\n\n"},{"author":"dammand32","created_utc":1502490840,"title":"GOP Group Backed By Mitch McConnell Wants Kid Rock To Actually Run For Senate | THE POLITICUS","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"DownWithGab","created_utc":1502492690,"title":"FREE SPEECH FOR GAB","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"nationalistsareRINOs","created_utc":1502496918,"title":"Underrated Anti-Poverty Policies","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1502498294,"title":"Liberal Democrat Vs.

Those opposed to litmus tests of any kind, and who advocate for blindly voting for a politician with a D next to their name *even if* the candidate with R next to their name happens to be the one rare Republican whose platform lines up more closely with your own - what does \"party\" mean? If it isn't a set of core ideological beliefs which must be shared across the board and supported, then what exactly is it?\n\nInterested in hearing answers from both those opposed to, and those in favour of, ideology requirements \/ litmus tests.

I figured I would share this with you guys as well to get some other perspectives on the issue.\n\n>\n>The bigotry and racism that has been associated with the right, came to a deadly conclusion this weekend in Charlottesville, however, doxxing those who were associated with this event promotes more division and pushes more moderate Republicans into the arms of the white nationalists. This occurs for two main reasons.\n>\n\n\n>\n>First, the synecdoche of stating that white nationalists represent all Republicans causes those who are fighting against racism in the republican party to feel as though they have no allies to fight this onslaught. They often feel besieged and outnumbered by the belief that all Democrats hate them and that they are alone in their party in reviling the racism that they can see. This is the same reasoning behind why many Islamic extremist groups commit terrorist attacks. They know that if they can generate hatred against Muslims as a whole, more will be susceptible to polarization due to feeling under attack. Instead of seeing the extremists as the enemy, they see everyone as an enemy but the unifying identity of Islam can push them further towards the extremists who show them compassion rather than the hatred they see among other groups. In order to fight the polarization which we have seen in this country, we need to come together and show moderate Republicans that they are not alone and that while we disagree on other issues, we are united in fighting the extreme alt-right.\n>\n\n\n>\n>The second reason doxxing can have a negative impact is how often vigilante justice vilifies the wrong person with potentially harmful effects. We have seen this many times, as for example, during the Boston Marathon bombing when the crowdsourced investigation wrongfully identified Sunil Tripathi as the bomber. This led to death threats to his family who were in the process of mourning their son, simply because someone identified him as missing and everyone else went along with it, without fact checking themselves. I have many problems with the justice system in this country but I believe in the right of everyone, no matter how terrible their crime, to have a chance to defend themselves in a court of law before being administered justice. Doxxing has consistently, wrongly identified people as demonstrated by Jon Ronson in his TED talk \u201cWhen online shaming goes too far.\u201d Each time the left wrongfully identifies someone and destroys their life, it gives white nationalist groups anecdotes which they can use to polarize more moderate Republicans away from the center by saying \u201cthis could happen to you too.\u201d\n>\n\n\n>\n>While I completely understand your anger and frustration about this event, I urge you to consider doxxing as a step too far. Instead, put your anger to use by writing to congressmen who have stood up against the white nationalists and thanking them, even if you don\u2019t agree with many of their other policies. I disagree with almost all of the stances which Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) has taken but I appreciate that he was quick to call out the president and say \"This isn't a time for innuendo or to allow room to be read between the lines. This is a time to lay blame.\" This was key in forcing Trump to finally speak out against white nationalism. Expose those who are in power and who have allowed this bigotry to fester within our country but please avoid from giving them more power by lumping all Republicans together or accidentally destroying an innocent\u2019s life.\n>\n\ntl;dr: Doxxing makes it harder to fight racism in our country. Instead support politicians who denounce the bigotry and fight against those who fail to speak out."},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1502748958,"title":"George Washington Totally Predicted President Donald Trump and Fake News","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1502749882,"title":"VICE Special Report: A House Divided","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1502751042,"title":"The Racism of the Republican Party (w\/ guest Mark Potok)","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"executivemonkey","created_utc":1502767860,"title":"Under Armour CEO adds his name to those leaving Trump's manufacturing council","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1502768714,"title":"Trump And Charlottesville: Too Little, Too Late | The Resistance","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"TroeAwayDemBones","created_utc":1502769410,"title":"Trump's Manufacturing Council collapses, how bout some soup?","num_comments":0,"description":"Let's keep the ball rolling, be polite.\n\nCEO of Cambell's Soup. #NoSoupFromYou!\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Imperative\/status\/896114150069293056"},{"author":"executivemonkey","created_utc":1502769715,"title":"US government demands details on all visitors to anti-Trump protest site","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1502770042,"title":"In Charlottesville, Trump Fails His First Test Of Leadership","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1502773345,"title":"Jimmy Fallon Addresses the Events in Charlottesville","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Anticipator1234","created_utc":1502774219,"title":"Mike Judge: Trump Makes \u2018Idiocracy\u2019 Look 'Optimistic\u2019","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"PUZZLEPIECER","created_utc":1502774888,"title":"Thin blue line flag","num_comments":2,"description":"What's everyone's opinions on them?

It is an intoxicating ideal that people can realize in small measure individually, but finally a political party is born to realize it as a goal of all society.\n\nThis party, the Up party, imagines an unlimited universe growing in this new direction.  But as happens, conservatives and reactionaries resist in fear, demanding to preserve their Flat Earth.  In ultimate reaction, some even invert the philosophy of Up and insist that Down is preferable.  Up things must be torn Down, and even existing Flat things must be driven into the bowels of the world.\n\nBut Down is a fringe, and Up spreads across the flat world, exalted.  Higher and higher, buildings rise and minds with them.  But it is realized in practice that buildings need foundations some ways beneath the ground to be stable, so the Up party must in practice do a little bit of Down digging in order to achieve its goals.  Only the most extreme Up idealists object, but most are content with a little bit of Down to serve the general Upward direction.\n\nThen one foundation dig hits upon a rich seam of gold, and the Up party finds that this gold pays for them to build even higher than they had ever dreamed.  So in addition to building Up, they become adept at digging far Down in search of riches to fund the Upward drive.  \n\nSlowly, without realizing it, greater and greater proportions of the Up party's time are spent discussing, planning for, and undertaking Downward digs in search of the gold.  In the course of these digs, the thoughts and beliefs of the Down *misosophy* become seductive, and strains of their ideology and thinking infect the Up party.  \n\nAt first the digging is just a means to the Upward ends, but the longer they spend doing it, and the more personally rewarding the dig becomes, Up begins to seem  naive.  The members of the Up party start to see the dichotomy in increasingly relativistic terms, or even quietly subscribe to the Down, weakening the party's ambitions and diverting strength to the fringe Down until it is a powerful and mainstreamed political element.\n\nLess and less of the funds obtained from Downward digs go to building Up, until none of them do, and the leaders of the Up party tell those who would build Up that it's just not practical to continue funding them.  They must be \"self-sufficient,\" and justify their Upward direction on the basis of Downward objectives.  The Down party digs deeper, and faster, and in a world where half even of the Up party subscribe to their mad dogma, they become dominant.\n\nFew inside the Up stop to wonder at the name of the Up party and what it's *supposed* to mean, or if they do, just assume it is cynical rhetoric rather than a reflection of real ideas.  And pretty soon the Down is so powerful that they begin to attack the Up projects that were already built so long ago: So much raw material that could instead be recycled for digging even further Down.\n\nThe exalted Up society not only freezes its advance, but is increasingly torn down in a headlong rush.  Up idealists still versed in the Up philosophy condemn the reversal, but in their pious outrage they condemn even those few still committed to building Up because they dig foundations to support their buildings, and that condemnation sabotages those they should be supporting.\n\nSoon there is no Up or even Flat, but a world of smoking pits and jagged scars carved into the land, Up banned as heresy because of a double betrayal: The executors of the idea had lost the objective, and the guardians of the principle had lost its purpose, increasingly defending it as little more than cargo cult.\n\nIf you would achieve something with society...\n\n* Do not allow means to become their own ends.\n\n* Do not allow ideals to stand in the way of their own achievement.  \n\nIf you are a pragmatist, do not betray yourself into becoming someone who just follows the path of least resistance down into an Orwellian \"Up is Down\" world.  If you are an idealist, do not become an idle solipsist who considers practical achievement to be a defiling of your perfect ideas.\n\nLet there be a Democratic Party that is ever and boldly striving toward democracy, composed of democratic people who know our obligations to each other and the future.\n\n\n"},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1503234332,"title":"Republicans alarmed & \u2018taken aback\u2019 at White House\u2019s flaccid response to Bannon threats","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1503235857,"title":"How Evangelicals Support White Supremacy\u2014Even Though They Reject Racism - Many conservative Christians don't actually support racism in thought.

One of the Republicans Candidates  Augustus Sol Invictus has bragged in the past about horrifically murdering and sacrificing a goat. This should be key ammo for the Democrats to expose the fact that the Republicans is essentially letting an evil person run for them. This not Invictus  being a white nationalist is what is important. Telling people that they are 'white priviledged' doesn't make them likely to vote for you, it actually unsurprisingly alienates them. \n\nHowever, America is a Christian country so the fact that Invictus  conducted what is a Pagan ritual will be horrifying for most Christians Most people don't like to think of animals being tortured so sane people won't vote for   Invictus. Even the Alt-Right will probably disavow them (say what you want about the Nazi's but they did care for animals. Goering even had people who hurt animals sent to Concentration Camps) so even white nationalists may not vote for them either.\n\nThe white nationalist narrative is getting a bit tired in some ways because race is a toxic subject and has been overused (not saying that is right, just that it is not effective). However, if the Democrats focus in Florida on the fact that one of the Republican senators is basically a sick freak, and the Republicans have allowed them on their platform that might do considerable damage to the local Republican Party. \n\nCalling people racist tends to turn wider people off but the vast majority of people don't want to have anything to do with someone who would torture murder and sacrifice an animal. It might even do some damage more widely to the Alt-Right as many have turned to them to preserve Christian America, and are far more likely to be alienated by a candidate admitted to enjoying torturing an innocent animal(in a very unchristian ritual as well) than they are by someone who has been called racist in the past."},{"author":"penguincheerleader","created_utc":1503364998,"title":"Krugman: What Will Trump Do to American Workers?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Demonteddybear13","created_utc":1503365583,"title":"Al Franken for President 2020","num_comments":5,"description":"If the Government is going to be a joke then we should leave it to the professionals "},{"author":"Anticipator1234","created_utc":1503369670,"title":"Remember when people like Sarah Palin shit their pants when Obama traveled on the taxpayer's dime?

If you want to host your own voter registration guide, check out [this guide](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/BlueMidterm2018\/wiki\/registration). Here's an overview:   \n   \n* Find a high foot-traffic area and, if it's private property like a college campus, get permission to register voters during a set timeframe September 26th or the weekend before\n* Review your [state's guidelines](http:\/\/fairelectionsnetwork.com\/state-guides\/). **All states require registration drives to be non-partisan.**\n* Recruit volunteers--make a facebook event, contact your local indivisible chapter, spam your friends, and be sure to [post it here](https:\/\/actionnetwork.org\/event_campaigns\/create-a-national-voter-registration-day-2016-event?referrer=stevie-valles&source=widget). Work with existing networks--there is a lot of political energy to be harnessed out there right now, use it to your advantage.\n* Make your registration drive go smoothly: I recommend setting up a table with 2-3 volunteers but having a majority of your volunteers walking around with clipboards to engage with people and cover a larger area. If you tape a piece of paper that reads \"Register to vote here\" on the back of clipboards, passerbys can quickly see that you're not trying to sell something, and can let you know if they're already registered.

We need to talk. \n\nI feel exactly the same burn from what\u2019s been happening as many of you do. No, maybe not the pepper spray, but that deep burning in my soul that makes me want to do something devastating to the right wing groups that have surfaced and tarnished the country. For my purposes, and anyone else\u2019s, I believe that the white nationalists, the KKK, the neo-Nazis, and anyone who would stand with them can rightfully be referred to as white supremacists, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do here. \n\nIn the past, there were public figures who led the charge against these types of sewer cretins that the public has to deal with today. These public figures used comedy as their weapon of choice. During the Bush and Obama administrations they helped us boil their idiocy down to quick quips and analogies that helped the whole world see their greed and laziness past their tactical obfuscation. It was very cathartic to have people that we all respect so much providing us some relief. Jon Stewart was a priceless left hook to right wing gaps in thought. Colbert\u2019s show on Comedy Central was a crushing straight right. The guys from Southpark were incendiary. The list goes on. \n\nToday the landscape is different. A lot of these outspoken heroes aren\u2019t as effective for one reason or another, and some have chosen silence. SNL is less popular than it\u2019s ever been in my perception, although they seem to be making an effort. The numbers might say otherwise, but it\u2019s just not the meeting place of cyncism that it\u2019s ever been in the past. \n\nMatt Stone and Trey Parker have mysteriously decided to bow out of the current conversation in an effort to not be like CNN, they\u2019ve said. Has that been their true purpose all along? To simply avoid being like CNN? Is that really what keeps them from doing the smashing down of ridiculous thinking they\u2019re so capable of? Is that really ever how they\u2019ve chosen their subject matter? If CNN gets there first, is that what tells them something doesn\u2019t deserve coverage? I\u2019ll never understand. \n\nColbert\u2019s late night show is no where near as effective as the fake right wing persona he embodied on his Comedy Central show. It\u2019s good, but on CS he was truly great. \n\nKevin Hart has publicly announced that he won\u2019t make fun of Trump. \n\nThere\u2019s much less public rebuttal to soften the blow of the white supremacists with these soldiers deciding to not show up to battle in the way the public had once trusted they would. \n\nWhat\u2019s left is CNN and Antifa getting most of the attention for the country\u2019s image of resistance to the blatant stupidity of these White Supremacists. For the purpose of giving the public hope, you and CNN are unfortunately very ill-equipped to take on that responsibility by using the tactics you so far have. \n\nI am an ethnic Jewish American. I\u2019m bothered by many aspects of the state of Israel because I see what\u2019s being done there as fascist in nature in many respects. Fascism and fascist tactics are objectively wrong. When fascists and Nazis use violence I believe I can support the use of violence in return, but Antifa has too often used fascist, terroristic tactics, as well. Fire can be fought with fire only when you\u2019re actually fighting a real forest fire. These White Supremacists are home-grown. They\u2019re here, enjoying all the liberties that are afforded to every American, so it\u2019s not like we can bomb them without hurting ourselves. It simply isn\u2019t World War 2 even though you\u2019re in the right. \n\nA very smart guy I know, a really brave and intelligent man, said that you can do some pretty terrible things when you think you\u2019re in the right, and you should think deeply about that. \n\nTo use force to apply a political ideology is fascist. You all have to come to Jesus on that. \n\nI fully support resistance. I fully support using every constitutionally protected right we have to that end, but to try to rationalize violent acts is a massive error. It\u2019s been shown to be as much, and we need to talk about how to do things in a more effective way going forward, you and I. \n\nWhat\u2019s missing is the comedy. George W. Bush is, without a doubt, cemented in history as the dumbest president that this country has ever seen before Trump came into the picture. The evidence is overwhelming. Why do we know? We know because the soldiers of truth used the sharp swords of mockery to get us all to laugh him and his out of power. We laughed until we had an opportunity for change. When that opportunity arrived we were engaged and we all knew what we were going to do and we elected Obama. While there are plenty of reasons to critique him, as there are any president, Obama was far and away the best president the country has had in a very long time. That was a battle fought correctly.  \n\nWe can\u2019t instill hope by giving in to the burning carnal desire of violence. That\u2019s the absence of hope. It\u2019s cornered animals that fight. Only weaponless rabbits who can\u2019t escape, the ones who\u2019ve given up hope, resort to lashing out physically. No one is really worried when they do. \n\nWe need to find the Mel Brooks in our rebellion. We need to find the ways available to us to expose the truly laughable, bed-wetting embarrassment these white supremacists are to the rest of the world. \n\nWatching you kids go out there with no combat training, with sticks and your doughy bodies clacking together with other physically unfit people, with the toothless hillbillies who\u2019ve roused themselves from their pathetic, immasculated lives of hot-dog preparation, is unspeakably cringe-worthy. It would be comedy if you all weren\u2019t turning it into a battle royale of all the kids who failed high school gym class and actually hurting each other.\n\nYou aren\u2019t a fearsome army. Neither are they. You\u2019re all just a bunch of nerds who could very much be using your greater strengths in far more intelligent ways. \n\nReason is on our side. That means comedy is, and comedy is the fuel for the greatest rebellions as we\u2019ve seen throughout the last years of government overreach and bar-lowering media like Fox News.\n\nPut down the goddam pepper spray. Leave your sharpened broom-handles at home. Don\u2019t you remember how hard the world laughed at that kid spinning around in front of a camera with his stick? Don\u2019t you remember the liberating laughter that provided the world? Well, I hate to have to be the one to tell you, but both you and the White Supremacists are all that kid, but worse. You\u2019re literally trying to do it for real and it makes me want to run and hide. You\u2019re doing no justice and you look just as ridiculous and pathetic as the supremacists. \n\nSo let\u2019s rethink this thing, huh? Let\u2019s try some new tactics. Let\u2019s really try to work from our strengths. We don\u2019t need Comedy Central. We don\u2019t need Kevin Hart. If they want to sit this one out I think it\u2019s a mistake. I think it\u2019s a level of complacency that\u2019s somewhat ignorant, but it\u2019s okay because fuck \u2018em if they don\u2019t want to take a side. We can do it ourselves, but we really have to wise up. \n\nI\u2019ve got ideas. Hit me up if you want to win this thing the right way.

I can say \"The apple is red\" without being an apple, having any connection whatsoever to apples, or any agenda regarding what color an apple is.  It's just an observation.\n\nBut the Trumpish mind is not capable of that.  There is no apple, there is no color red - there are just various aspects of the Self and how the world causes them to see that Self.  If you say \"The apple is red,\" or \"The sky is blue,\" or \"It's hot today,\" their brain does not process the statement as a normal person's would, as statements about the outside world - there *is* no outside world to them.  \n\nNo matter what you're saying to them, **what they hear is a bunch of associations to their identity**, however tortuous and irrational the connection is.  \"The apple is red\"...an apple is a fruit...fruit is a word for gay, so agreeing with a statement about a fruit might bring my sexual orientation into question!  \"The sky is blue\"...blue means Democrat...fuck them libruls...I ain't admittin' the sky is blue to no goddamn Democrat!  \n\nThat sounds (and is, utterly) insane, but realize that they say and believe things every bit as crazy every day, and that make no sense unless you realize that they see everything as a statement about their identity.  Once you do realize it, then the way that Trump - which is to say, Putin - seems to control their minds like a bunch of Orwellian automatons makes a lot more sense.\n\nThe idea of a vast immigrant conspiracy to \"take Murca away from us\" doesn't require evidence, because the right-wing mind doesn't speak to any external reality, only to internal emotions about identity. The claim therefore is judged based on how it makes the solipsistic right-wing personality **feel about itself**, nothing else.  And what it feels is (a) I possess something valuable that others envy, and therefore (b) I am superior.  \n\n**The bigoted conspiracy theory is like crack to such a mind**.  No fact can penetrate it, because facts are not part of the syntax of fascistic thought in the first place.  **Only identity exists**.  \n\nGratification of that identity is the only test of reality.  If their identity is gratified by a statement, then they will defend it to the death - specifically *your* death, if you persist in confronting them with a reality outside themselves.  The solipsist considers such information tantamount to an existential threat, because it violates the basic structure of their thought.\n\nAny fact that is unflattering to their identity is false by definition in that system, and asserting it is a direct attack on them.  To assert that they are not even an element of the topic - that a fact is true or untrue irrespective of them - sounds like complete nonsense to them, and would slide in one ear and out the other as if you were speaking an unintelligible foreign language.\n\nThus, tyrants like Putin and his tool Trump simply structure their statements such that everything they oppose is an identity attack on their followers, and everything they support is a gratification of that identity.  \n\nThe fact that this leads to belief in contradictions is irrelevant, because there is no contradiction possible to a totally self-absorbed mind reducing all human communication to a One or Zero, \"Like\" or \"Dislike\" binary - something that can easily be hacked and reprogrammed by a malicious agenda.\n\nLittle surprise then that such brains are the native habitats of tyranny, bigotry, and eliminationist ideologies, since even the basic shreds of reason would otherwise be a hostile environment for them.  They are \"enclosed in a nutshell and consider themselves kings of infinite space.\"  Fascism addresses itself to the interior of the shell and denies that an exterior even exists.\n\nThis alone is what makes Newspeak possible, and is why every species of politically-motivated Denialism is endemic to this mentality: Holocaust denial, Climate denial, evolution denial, every form and manifestation of narcissism-driven history revisionism, etc. etc.\n\nSo that is basically what right-wing language is: A diarrhea of identity-gratifying falsehoods from people whose minds are simply lacking basic human communication tools.

If I am shown a 1 min video about a sad story about an immigrant family and child, MOST or EVERY Human will feel emotionally connected and have some sense of morals overcome them, But the issue with morals is that it undermines the entire Immigration process. There are millions of sad stories about immigration but The US needs to have some value to its LAWS. Unfortunately I don't hear liberals telling me their Immigration POLICY because they don't have one. *The Goal is to deal with the immigration Problem, Not Ignore it.\" DACA has surly helped out many immigrants whose parents put them in this situation but that shouldn't undermine the fact that their illegal ALIENS. My Family are Democrats (I am first one to lean republican), but in particular, they came here Legally from Pakistan. It's understandable to help young immigrant children, but by doing so, what happens the the laws, if we give Illegal immigrants opportunities, it only encourages more to come illegally. Despite a growing border security system, we are only able to catch 30% of border crossing ALIENS and those who overstay their visa's only add to our crippling Immigration Problem. I don't blame the Right at all because NO ONE HATES THE IDEA OF IMMIGRATION THEY HATE THE IDEA OF *ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION*\n\n\n\nThis whole talk about immigration policy always gets hated on by liberals but they never seem to have a policy themselves.

The agreement is widely seen as giving a stronger negotiation position to the Democrats come December. What is preventing McConnell and Ryan from refusing to add the 3-month debt limit and 3-month funding to the Harvey relief bill in Congress? Isn't there a way of the Republican leadership to convince the White House that the President is making a mistake and that the Democrats will fold and vote for a separate 18-month debt limit extension?\nI am asking because from what I have been reading it almost looks like once the President has made the deal with the Democrats the Congressional Republicans have to go along.

Republicans control the overwhelming majority of states**.\n\nThat means they control the election infrastructure going into the next season.  That's bad enough under the best of circumstances, but in the total absence of a federal authority forcing them to obey civil and voting rights laws, those laws simply will not be in effect.  GOP officials in at least 30 states will act with impunity, on an effectively third-world level.\n\nThis is what *will* happen if the Democratic Party does not radicalize immediately and begin dismantling Republican power.\n\n**II.  The Sessions DOJ will not enforce civil rights or voting rights laws.**\n\nWhen a law is not enforced, no such law is present.  And with the Arpaio pardon, the Trump regime demonstrated its willingness to hold its criminal allies above the law when they violate court orders, so anything ordered by a federal court is already effectively null and void.  Rulings from judges will simply be ignored, and any attempt to take it to the Supreme Court will be futile because of illegitimate plant Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThis is what *will* happen if the Democratic Party does not radicalize immediately and begin dismantling Republican power.\n\n**III.  Republican local governments will act tyrannically to suppress votes and defraud elections even beyond the standard set by GOP state officials.**\n\nWho is going to stop them?  If anything, local right-wing police departments will be acting under the orders of Republican state officials, if not with the full encouragement of the Trump regime to act as militias preventing \"illegal alien voting\" (i.e., voting by non-whites or anyone who seems liberal) at gunpoint.\n\nThey will commit the entire spectrum of stereotypical third-world election-rigging activity: Roadblocks in minority areas, mass-arrests in minority areas, falsifying voter registrations, stealing voting equipment away from Democratic areas and delivering it to Republicans, and probably just outright ballot-box stuffing.  \n\nAgain, who is going to stop them?  The laws against these acts are federal, which means Jeff Sessions would have to enforce them.  HE WILL NOT.  So they will occur on a mass-scale with impunity.\n\nThis is what *will* happen if the Democratic Party does not radicalize immediately and begin dismantling Republican power.\n\n**IV.  Russian hacking and propaganda has not been addressed, and will only get worse from now on.**\n\nThe Kremlin owns the White House right now, and effectively has full security clearance into American federal institutions.  Only clandestine groups within institutions are perhaps keeping some secrets in defense of the republic, but that is trivial compared to the information now completely at the fingertips of Vladimir Putin and his hackers and trolls.\n\nThey now have vastly more information than what they needed to rig the 2016 election in key states and districts, and have effectively turned off the US government's defenses of American election infrastructure.  We are either completely transparent right now, or effectively so.  \n\nSince Democrats have been deprived of legislative power through gerrymandering and vote suppression, there will not only be no legislative address of Russian power over our elections, but the GOP will *continue* to actively and treasonously collaborate in the dismantling of the Republic.  And the same goes for the state and local level.\n\nThis is what *will* happen if the Democratic Party does not radicalize immediately and begin dismantling Republican power.\n\n**V.  Democratic officials continue to pretend all is normal.**\n\nIf that does not change - if we do not radicalize immediately and begin dismantling Republican power, not just doing the same old things with more emphatic rhetoric - we will become a token, rump minority party demonized by a monolithic State-run media (the Sinclair-Tribune colossus Trump intends to permit) and routinely trounced in farcical Middle East-style \"elections\".  \n\nAnd *that* future is the optimistic one where the GOP does not simply declare a formal, China-style One-Party State where anyone other than Republicans are not permitted in government, either simultaneous with or shortly after declaring martial law. \n\nDonald Trump is in open, daily violation of the Constitution, and the probability of Republicans impeaching him for it is zero.  That means the Constitution is defunct, and their power will continue to increase with time the longer we passively wait for \"elections\" whose rigged outcomes have already been decided if we continue like this.\n\n**This is what *will* happen if the Democratic Party does not radicalize immediately and begin dismantling Republican power.**\n\nThis state of affairs is not a democracy right now, nor even a limited Constitutional republic.  We are being held hostage by an **absolute oligarchy** that is still growing into and testing the full limits of its power, and sooner or later it will get around to all the things we've been warned of repeatedly: The tanks in the streets, the mass-roundups, the murdered journalists, on and on.  \n\nBut we have this chance now, while they are in chaos, to recognize the situation our country is in and act accordingly rather than *pretending* we are still what we were before.  The institutions that protected us before **do not exist right now**.  There will only be elections **if we insist**, and they will be free and fair only to the degree we insist.\n\nResist.  \n\n#INSIST."},{"author":"weev1","created_utc":1505065887,"title":"Biden's daughter: I hope he runs in 2020.","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"UtahAffairsMan","created_utc":1505073120,"title":"The website of the Republican candidate for Utah\u2019s open congressional seat is nothing but a home page.

The stakes are too important. \n\nWith Senator Bernie Sanders announcement that he will sponsor the Medicare for All legislation in the Senate, many progressives found it amusing how Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gilibrand and Cory Booker who many in our party call \"Corporate Democrats\" I personally started sensing a great amount of fear regarding how split the Democrats truly are, and think it wise that the Party start figuring out how to address this problem asap. After all, agree with this or not- Hillary did in fact come to a defeat PARTIALLY because many Bernie supporters could not vote for her in the General Election. This type of attitude I don't think we can afford again. \n\nRight now Bernie Sanders I feel has a presumptive lock on the nomination for 2020. Still Senator Kamala Harris appears to be the Hillary supporters as well as Democratic donor favorites. In the hypothetical world where Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic nominee for President, can Berniecrats not only support her candidacy but also go out and vote in record numbers to secure the White House?

Despite the fact that, according to a June 2017 Quinnipiac University poll, **94 percent of Americans support comprehensive background checks for gun sales, including 92 percent of gun owners**, many politicians have shied away from taking on the NRA. The vocal minority of voters against gun safety laws have historically been more organized, better funded, and more willing to be single-issue voters.\n\nIn the 1990s, my husband fought hard to pass both a ten-year ban on assault weapons and the Brady Bill, which, for the first time, required background checks on many gun purchases at federally licensed firearms dealers. In the years since, that law has blocked more than two million purchases by convicted felons, domestic abusers, and fugitives. **The NRA funded an intense backlash to the new safety measures and helped defeat a lot of Democratic members of Congress in the disastrous 1994 midterm elections**. Then, in 2000, the NRA helped beat Al Gore. \n\n---------\n\nPage 182\n\nWayne LaPierre helped make the NRA one of the most reactionary and dangerous organizations in America. Instead of being concerned with the interests of everyday gun owners, many of who *support* commonsense safety protections, **the NRA has essentially become a wholly owned subsidiary of the powerful corporations that make and sell guns.** Their bottom line and twisted ideology are all that matters to them, even if it costs thousands of American lives every year. \n\n---------\n\nPage 183\n\nAfter the massacre of nine parishioners at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, my team focused on **why the twenty-one-year-old white supremacist killer was able to buy a gun despite having an arrest record that should have been flagged by the required background check. We found that, under the current law, if a background check is not completed after three days, a store is free to sell a gun with no questions asked.** This is the result of an amendment the NRA designed and pushed through Congress during the debate over the Brady Bill in 1993. **Experts say that more than fifty-five thousand gun sales that should have been blocked have been allowed to proceed because of what we started calling the \"Charleston loophole.\"** I made closing it and other gun loopholes a major part of my campaign.\n\n---------\n\nPage 185-186\n\nGuns became a flash point in both the primaries and the general election. **Bernie Sanders, who loved to talk about how \"true progressives\" never bow to political realities or powerful interests, had long bowed to the political reality of his rural state of Vermont and supported the NRA's key priorities, including voting against the Brady Bill five times in the 1990s.** **In 2005, he voted for that special immunity law that protects gun makers and sellers from being sued when their weapons are used in deadly attacks**. The NRA said the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act was the most important gun-related legislation in more than twenty years. Then-Senator Barack Obama and I had voted against it. I couldn't believe Bernie continued to support the law ten years later when he ran for President. \n\nI hammered him on the issue every chance I got. We had a revealing exchange in a town hall debate in March 2016. A man stepped up to the microphone to ask a question. His fourteen-year-old daughter had been shot in the head during a shooting spree outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant. After a few scary days on life support, she pulled through and ended up being the lone survivor of the attack. The father asked what we were going to do to address the epidemic of gun violence stalking our country. \n\n\"I am looking at your daughter, and I'm very grateful that she is laughing and she is on the road to recovery,\" I said. \"But it never should have happened.\" I told him about some of the steps I wanted to take to keep families safe, including repealing the immunity protection for gun manufacturers. The moderator then asked Bernie his thoughts about a new lawsuit challenging that corporate immunity. **To my surprised, the Senator doubled down. He argued passionately that people like me who talked about suing gun makers were really talking about \"ending gun manufacturing in America.\"** To him, the idea that a manufacturer could be held liable for what happens with its gun was tantamount to saying that \"there should not be any guns in America.\" I couldn't have disagreed more strongly. **No other industry in our country has the kind of protection he supported for gun manufacturers**. And **in every other situation, he was the loudest voice in the room calling for corporations to be held accountable for their actions. Why was this one issue so different?** As I told the crowd, it was like he was reading straight from the NRA's talking points. After months of pressure from activists and victims' families, Bernie finally said he would reconsider his vote. \n\n\n-----\n\nPage 188-189\n\n**All told, the gun lobby spent more than $30 million supporting Trump, more money than any other outside group and more than double what it spent to support Mitt Romney in 2012.** About two-thirds of that money paid for more than ten thousands negative ads attacking me in battleground states. The organization didn't have the guts to take on my specific policy proposals - which were widely popular, even with a lot of gun owners. Instead, it went for fear mongering and demonizing. In one ad, a woman is alone in bed when a robber breaks into the house. \"Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone,\" the narrator warns, suggesting falsely that I would have stopped law-abiding Americans from having guns. \n\nI'm sure that some of my fellow Democrats will look at this high-priced onslaught and conclude, as many have in the past, that standing up to the NRA just isn't worth it. Some may put gun safety on the chopping block alongside reproductive rights as \"negotiable,\" so as not to distract from populist economics. Who knows - the same might happen to criminal justice reform and racial justice more broadly. **That would be a terrible mistake. Democrats should not respond to my defeat by retreating from our strong commitments on these life-or-death issues.** The vast majority of Americans agree that we need to do more on gun safety. **This is a debate we can win if we keep at it.**"},{"author":"exmuslimanonymous","created_utc":1506134285,"title":"What is an Ex-Muslim?","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mykle1984","created_utc":1506135827,"title":"Just when I thought r\/TheDonald couldn't be anymore insane...","num_comments":12,"description":""},{"author":"heqt1c","created_utc":1506139009,"title":"Senator Merkley Speaks Out Against Graham-Cassidy","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"heqt1c","created_utc":1506140892,"title":"Bernie: We are not going to let this horrific legislation pass.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"conuly","created_utc":1506140921,"title":"In Battle Over Tax Cuts, It's Republicans vs. Economists","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"GMapper14","created_utc":1506141266,"title":"I love when a religious \"celebrity\" tries to \"subtly\" slander LGBT rights.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieDarwin2","created_utc":1506163349,"title":"Russia turns on Morgan Freeman over election 'war' video","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1506171486,"title":"Gun Pimp Conditioning.","num_comments":53,"description":""},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1506171700,"title":"\"But but but I just couldn't bring myself to vote for her after the Vegas primary.

As has become obvious to many, the Republican party has no interest in governing this country effectively, so it has become impossible for me to identify with them any further.  That being said, I have the following concerns\/thoughts:\n\n1. Whatever amount of money the DNC is currently spending on marketing is not enough.  Despite 9 months of purely asinine hypocrisy, cruelty and racism from the Republican party, I think it is fair to say that on a national level, most non-Democrats would still not consider them a viable alternative.  Your brand is so terrible that even Donald Trump is all his idiotic glory cannot persuade others to vote for your candidates.  Yes, you have had limited success with some special mid-term elections.  Just think about that for a second... despite everything that has happened, despite watching a 9-year-old run this country and his supposed adult handlers tolerate it, these races are a close call.  Not a land-slide.  Not a huge epiphany for a large part of conservative America.\n\nOne could argue that there are several reasons for that.  Most Republicans would probably say that Trump does not represent \"True Republican Principles\", whatever those are.  Some just really, really hate the Clintons.  It doesn't matter.  What horrifies me more than Trump winning the previous election is the prospect that we could be dealing with exactly the same circumstances 3 years from now, and worse, Democratic leadership has done nothing to change the balance of the next engagement.  Pointing out all the insane things Trump does or says is not working.  Marching in LBGT parades is not working.  Now is the time to look in the mirror, kick some ass, fire some people, hire Apple's marketing team and do something that works.\n\n2. One of the overwhelming, fatal flaws with the Democratic brand is that they have no coherent narrative.  This is not the answer to \"What do you stand for?\"  In conservative America, it's \"obvious\" what you stand for: abortion, gays, more or less black people.  A narrative is this: in the history of America, we have only achieved greatness when we all worked together toward a common goal.  That we are a nation of immigrants and to denigrate immigrants now is to spit in the face of what our parents believed in.  That our government can protect us against large, monied interests.  A coherent narrative like this could have mottos like \"Better Together\" or \"E pluribus unum\".  \n\nBottom line, please get your shit together, DNC.  You are our only hope for unity in these dark times.  Do not blame Republicans for your inability to provide a viable alternative.  \n\n\n\nTL;DR  Triple the marketing budget of the DNC, or 2020 is going to be a repeat of 2016."},{"author":"Anticipator1234","created_utc":1506293821,"title":"Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner used a private email account to conduct White House business dozens of times","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1506295780,"title":"Democratic senators preparing bill to deal with online political advertising","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"TK2510","created_utc":1506296508,"title":"CNN Poll: Opinion of the Republican Party falls to all-time low","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1506302020,"title":"#TrumpIsWeak","num_comments":23,"description":""},{"author":"heqt1c","created_utc":1506307292,"title":"Poll: Majority supports single-payer health care","num_comments":35,"description":""},{"author":"thgntlmnfrmtrlfmdr","created_utc":1506307746,"title":"Unscrewing the Lid on Surveillance Capitalism","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"heqt1c","created_utc":1506310181,"title":"Obamacare Repeal Officially Dead After Cruz Says No","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"heqt1c","created_utc":1506323751,"title":"Americans Must Be Told the Cost of Our Wars","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"Warpimp","created_utc":1506341956,"title":"How open are Democrats on economic policy?","num_comments":19,"description":"I am done with the GOP.

I'm not a Republican. Who should I vote for?","num_comments":8,"description":"I'm voting in the Republican run-off, although I'm not a Republican. \n\nI'm considering Voting for Roy Moore for 3 reasons. \n\n1) he's much older. In Alabama, as with most places, Senators tend to stay in office until they die. By electing the older guy, it hopefully gives Democrats a chance sooner, rather than later. As in 9 or 15 years from now when Moore retires, maybe the politics of the state will have moved enough to the left to give a Democrat a chance in an open seat. Whereas with Strange, he's younger and could be in office a lot longer as an incumbent. \n\n2) maybe Moore is radical enough to actually give Doug Jones a fighting chance in December. While unlikely, Doug Jones would probably have a better chance against Moore than he would against Luther Strange. Or maybe if not this year, similar to point 1, maybe a Democrat will have a better chance in 3 or 9 years against an incumbent radical Roy Moore than against traditional Republican Luther Strange. \n\n3) both candidates will have similar voting agendas in Congress, so it doesn't really hurt the left having another crazy on the far right. If anything, maybe it helps having someone to antagonize Mitch McConnell from the right. Maybe it makes the Republicans look weak and drives independents to the left, just to get away from a crazy Senator like Moore. \n\nAm I off base here? While I think Strange and Moore are both bad for Alabama and America, I actually think Moore is less bad in the long-run specifically because he's so terrible. \n\nInput would be appreciated.

Not knowing that our Constitution says nothing like that but on the contrary says that a person has to be a 'Natural born citizen' with one parent born in America which Obama's mother was.\n\nSo all his actions now with the disaster in Puerto Rico is coming from his very bad blood that he inherited from his KKK father.\n\n\nHe doesn't care for the people who're not totally White or who're not Jewish nor Christians (although most of the people of PR are Christians. But for Trump they're not Christians enough just like the Mexicans are who're mostly Christians too).\n\nSo I'll blame Trump's supporters for the racist actions of Trump, because they voted for him knowing from the beginning like we the Democrats know that Trump is nothing but a thoroughly racist monster that was ever born in our country as well as in this world.\n\n\"So,Trump's supporters know fully well that anything bad that happens in this country you're to be blamed for voting for a totally racist individual called Donald J.

I have managed two previous writing websites which started out on the basis of free writing, then as it grew and sponsorships and ad revenue grew accordingly, writers were paid on the merit of their abilities.

So with the whole shooting in Vegas today got me thinking about gun rights in America. I come from a family who doesn't hunt so I don't have much background in it but this is my opinion. I think that all automatic assault rifles should be flat out banned from the U.S with two exceptions, one being the military and the other being at gun ranges. I say they should still be at gun ranges because gun nuts often say \"I like my ar's cause they're fun to shoot.\" This satisfies both sides with gun nuts being able to shoot and democrats getting ar's out of the U.S. Then some people may say they need it for self defense, but who in the right mind would use a ar for self defense and the odds of you ever needing a gun for self defense in your lifetime is slim to none. So with ar's out of the way let's get to hunting rifles. I think these should be allowed in the U.S because hunting is a big part of the culture here and we can't take that away. But, my idea with these rifles is to build shops that are built to hold these rifles in the off-season of hunting. So these buildings would hold people's guns for a small fee and doing this would first get guns out of people's hands, second create jobs in the U.S, and third create another source of revenue for the U.S because it will boost the economy. Then, for the gun nuts again who say they want their guns to shoot for fun, there will be shooting ranges at the gun holding facility so gun owners can pick their gun up on site (free of charge), go shoot for a bit, then return their gun back as simple as tat. Then with no guns being in people's hands you won't need them for self defense and such. This solution satisfies both sides of the spectrum because democrats get guns out of the us and republicans still get to shoot their guns. I know this may have many holes in it but I'm just a 15 year old kid who doesn't like guns and wants to share his opinion, thanks for reading!"},{"author":"KubrickIsMyCopilot","created_utc":1507004914,"title":"Beyond all politics: Yes, the Republican Party is responsible for the Las Vegas mass-murder.

On the second point, it seems clear that for the immediate future, our society as a whole lacks the ability to take steps that will reduce the likelihood and\/or toll of mass shootings (and of gun violence generally). That's why we need to immediately support mandatory firearm liability insurance that will help victims of gun violence and their families better cope with the financial toll taken by firearms. And for any \"gaps\" that firearm liability insurance would not cover, we should support a fee on firearm sales that would go toward a \"Gun Violence Victim Fund\" to defray the financial cost of gun violence. Democrats should work on all fronts to confront gun violence, but mandatory firearm liability insurance is something that can be done now to assist those impacted by gun violence.\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/tonytfornv.com\/news\/2017\/10\/7\/tony-t-smith-calls-for-mandatory-firearm-insurance"},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1507493820,"title":"Barack Obama candidates: Colorado has a swath of people running for office tied to the former president","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"spartan2600","created_utc":1507493985,"title":"Hillary Clinton Says It Is Her Fault Trump Is President","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1507495067,"title":"California Moved Its Primary Up.

There's a lot of FDR going on here\u2014[a lot](https:\/\/www.johnmoserforcongress.com\/who-am-i\/a-new-deal\/)\u2014and I often wonder on how to handle other Democrats.  I'm pretty good at handling Republicans, oddly enough, despite all the heavy progressive policies and stronger welfare programs.  The far-right conservatives hate me but eh, they hate everyone.\n\n**Corporate Income Tax Rate**\n\nThe fiscal responsibility angle is a core principle of the New Democratic Coalition, although I'm an odd case:  I don't care for corporate income taxes and would rather kill them just to put an end to the political noise.\n\nIn 2016, the Corporate Income Tax (at 35%) drew $299.6 billion of revenue out of a total $2,656 billion from incomes and FICA.  If my [Universal Benefit](https:\/\/www.johnmoserforcongress.com\/issues\/universal-social-security\/) had been in effect, that would be the 15% Universal Benefit tax plus $168 billion of Corporate Income Tax revenue.  Ineffective revenue source:  it's not chump change, but it's certainly not a hell of a lot.\n\nThe Republicans think repealing Corporate Income Taxes *creates* jobs; it doesn't.  It gives corporations *agility*:  when the market changes (e.g. technical progress), corporations can react faster.  You get lay-offs (unemployment) and you need to change (cost) to create the *new* jobs replacing the old.  In other words:  it matters when a recession hits or in rapid market growth; it doesn't really matter otherwise.\n\nConsumer buying power creates *new* jobs.  Consumers being able to buy more (without a change in technology) means you need new jobs to make more\u2014that happens when you reduce the taxes on lower- and middle-class individuals.\n\nSo I have no real hunger for a higher Corporate Income Tax rate, because it doesn't buy anything.  I can see an economic argument for less, although I bounded that against my new system which gives Americans a share of the economy\u2014a *dividend* off a small holding in our productivity\u2014because that's the only way to actually capture a (mostly-)accurate proportion of production.\n\nBesides, Franklin D. Roosevelt was pretty keen on American enterprise's entitlement to a fair profit\u2014I count by proportion, not by enormous flat numbers.\n\n**Public Healthcare**\n\nPublic option.\n\nMedicare-for-all is an expensive plan\u2014$1.8 billion in additional costs, given the cost of healthcare.  You'd have to bump taxes by some 85%, so a 40% tax rate on the middle-class, assuming you cut the effective tax rate down with my Universal Benefit first.\n\nYes, I said middle-class.\n\nWhen you exclude the non-production money (CEO stock options take money from people's hedge funds by essentially creating inflation in the currency of their corporate stock), big executives make less per-person the more they earn.  A small business with 5 minimum-wage employees ($18k) and a proprietor making just $50k has a CEO who makes $10,000 per employee.  The guy who owns Sinclair Broadcast Group makes $1,000,000 in total cash compensation from 8,400 employees\u2014$119\/year.  Mike Fields, CEO of Ford, makes $22.50 per employee per year, or $67.50\/year if you only count the American employees.\n\nCan you buy healthcare with that money?\n\nIt cost $9,024 per-capita for healthcare in the United States in 2016; employers averaged $6,690 per individual and $18,764 per family insurance.  With $368 billion of Medicaid money (I'm ignoring CHIP, so this is a low number), we can cover 55 million Americans with average employer healthcare, or just under 40.8 million at the full cost of healthcare (assuming no overhead).\n\nWith 70 million without private insurance, I have a $200 billion gap there I'd like to close.  A stronger mandate might help; so would finding ways to reduce our cost of care.  (I'm aware I said the $168 billion thing above was small and ineffective\u2014I also said it's not chump change.)\n\nI happen to favor a public option; the current disposition of the Democratic Party is for a single-payer system; and the Republicans just scream socialism and lobby to have the States implement healthcare *while cutting their funding for any form of healthcare assistance*.\n\n**Minimum Wage**\n\nI'm kind of keen on tying minimum wage to the Universal Benefit I designed.  That effectively means a full-time minimum-wage worker gets an $8.75\/hr wage in 2016, but takes home a little more than $13\/hr minus some change (taxes).\n\nThe Universal Benefit isn't subject to taxation (it's not counted as income\u2014or rather, it's counted as income, taxed, then collected and redistributed post-taxation) and only registered as \"unearned income\" for welfare calculation purposes (which immediately makes 100% of Americans ineligible for SSI, btw, because they have too much income), so that's actually a bit more take-home income than an *actual* $13\/hr wage.\n\nSo yeah, an income floor and a minimum income for the working-man, as well as a minimum compensation (wage) for working-hours.  There's a portion of that not being directly paid as wage, which segways to...\n\n**Payroll Tax**\n\nMy Universal Benefit grows faster than Social Security's benefits, and I made Social Security solvent by simply displacing those benefits:  if you were going to get $1,200\/month in retirement from OASDI, then you might instead get $800 from the UB and $400 from OASDI\u2014you know, $1,200, not a dime less.\n\nAt 5.15%, the Social Security Trust will be taking more in than it pays out by 2022.  As time goes by, the Trust will be growing *too* fast, and that payroll tax needs to come down.\n\nTo pay payrolls\u2014wages, taxes, and benefits\u2014a company needs revenue.  That means they need to charge a price covering the labor time worked to provide a good or service in order to pay the workers.  **Consumers pay wages, payrolls, and benefits**.\n\nCompetition increases as goods become cheaper to produce:  broader markets are available, the cost to enter is lower, and so the risk is smaller.  That means the profit margin on high-dollar luxury products is high, and on commodity goods it's low.  The rich, thus, buy goods and services (and stock market investments!) facing proportionally more profit and less labor:  payroll taxes are regressive.\n\nI have no love for payroll tax.\n\nPut that with the Corporate Income Tax observation above and you get an unfashionable position for a Democrat today:  it *looks* like corporations pay wages and payroll taxes, so people demand they pay.\n\nSo... now what?  I feel like I'm going to be an odd one even for the NDC."},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1508120258,"title":"Kevin de Le\u00f3n formally launches bid to unseat Sen.

Watson of the Federal District Court in Honolulu,HI, who's a million times smarter than Trump is, called this latest ban correctly like he did the last two bans that all Trump is trying to do is keeping his campaign promises to his supporters who're nothing but racist bastards like their leader is,\"to ban the Muslims coming to this country\" which Trump promised to do in a campaign in June last year when supposedly a Muslim couple gunned down 14 people in San Barnardino,CA.\n\nBut this racist president Trump had nothing to say to the slain shooter Stephen Paddock who gunned down our 58+ people and maimed more than 500+ fantastic Americans in Las Vegas recently.\n\nEven the fact that most of the Country Music Festival goers who were shot by this beast from the 32nd floor of his hotel room, voted for Trump in the last election and to the Republican candidates throughout their lives, didn't sway our thoroughly racist president Trump whose father was a racist bastard belonging to KKK all his life, and call this shooter a \"home grown terrorist\" just because he was a White American like our racist president Trump is and most probably Trump knows in his heart that this monster called Paddock voted for him in the last election.\n\nHope all the nine judges in the S.C.O.T.U.S. support the order given by this Judge in Hawaii and give a very clear message to our thoroughly racist president Trump that as long as he behaves like a racist monster he'll not get any support from any Judges in this country.\n\nAnd if Trump mocks the Asian look of this Judge Watson of Hawaii and says something nasty against his ethnicity like he said against Judge Curiel in his campaign stops on 2016 saying this very incorrectly, \"Judge Curiel doesn't like my building of the wall on the Mexican border because he's a Mexican\".\n\nThat statement was farthest from the truth as Judge Curiel was born and brought up in Indiana which probably was unknown to Trump or maybe he thought Indiana belonged to Mexico. \n\nAnd as we all know now that with Trump's shallow knowledge anything is possible. Even the location of Indiana.\n\nHe might even question Judge Watson's ethnicity since our favorite Judge from Hawaii looks different than Trump. \n\nOr maybe Trump doesn't even know that Hawaii belongs to our sovereign country. the United States of America."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508325720,"title":"Pages from 'How the People Trumped Ronald Plump'","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1508326626,"title":"Memo Undermines Russian Lawyer\u2019s Account of Trump Tower Meeting - It bolsters the case that she was acting on behalf of the Kremlin.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1508327211,"title":"'Our task was to set Americans against their own government': New details emerge about Russia's trolling operation","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508327947,"title":"Trump: Dem congresswoman 'totally fabricated' his remarks to widow of fallen soldier","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1508328187,"title":"Trump\u2019s 12 days of silence on the combat deaths of four soldiers","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1508328390,"title":"Team Trump & GOP Pals Pass Go, Spend $1.7 Million at Trump Properties - It\u2019s not personal.

Johnson was a White woman, Trump would've been much more courteous towards her spelling her White husband's name like a bird because of the sound of her White voice and accent which is the only voice he ever likes to hear in his life.\n\nYes, he would've been totally respectful towards her not like what he was with Ms. Johnson only because she was Black just like her slain husband.\n\nTrump would've also used totally different words using the innuendo to a White Ms.Johnson saying that her 'White husband died for the country not knowing what'd happen to him'.\n\nBut since Sgt. Johnson's widow was Black, Trump decided not to show any respect to her but told her point blank that her husband died because he knew what he was getting into when he joined the army.\n\nHis blaming of Obama for not calling General Kelly after his son died is another sign of this totally prejudiced man's actions as he forgot to mention that Obama called MR. Kelly and his wife for dinner honoring all the Gold Star families.\n\nAnd Michelle Obama sat right next to the Kelly family in that dinner and treated them like royalty which was much better than how Trump treated the Gold Star family of Humayun Khan who died in a an ambush trying to protect his fellow soldiers.\n\nBut Trump kept on calling ugly names right before the election to the parents of the slain soldier called Khizr and Ghazala Khan because they were from Pakistan with Muslim background which Trump hated all his life.  \n\nAnd his treatment of one of the most respected veteran called John McCain is quite well known as that is the worst treatment that any president ever treated a veteran who was captured by the North Vietnamese and tortured for many years. \n\nSo Trump can say anything to rebut these charges but his racist character will always come out and bite his butt.\n\nHe can never escape from this, no matter how he tries."},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1508415037,"title":"Senators target election meddling with new social media bill","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508416353,"title":"Trump Suggests \u2018Fake Dossier\u2019 Was a Conspiracy Between Russia, FBI, Democrats","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1508417225,"title":"Weakening Medicaid From Within - The Trump administration is poised to misuse its legal authority in an effort to cull people from the Medicaid rolls.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1508417674,"title":"Hail to the Queef.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1508417747,"title":"Kneels and Heels.","num_comments":89,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1508418399,"title":"Mnuchin Gives Away the Game: \"It's Very Hard Not to Give Tax Cuts to the Wealthy\" - \"Guy who wrote Trump's tax plan says that the laws of math basically forced him to give rich people a huge cut.\"","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1508418478,"title":"As $25k Unmet Offer to Family Exposed, Trump Told to \"Stop.

She really hits the nail on the head with her assessment. Brutally honest.\n\n>Well you can\u2019t make it the main focus, but you can\u2019t drop it off the table. You know, I beat Bernie Sanders by four million votes, okay. So that was a landslide by any definition. He was very clear that there was only one message, a single message about billionaires, you know, take back America from the billionaires, and he had ideas which were hard for him to explain but he never had to explain them except in one editorial board meeting with the New York Daily News. Otherwise, he could just hammer away. Now, he lost the Democratic primary, and so I\u2019m arguing that it can\u2019t be either-or, it has to be both-and. So when people say, you know, just give up on that civil rights stuff, don\u2019t talk about it. Look what Trump is doing. He\u2019s playing to his base by demeaning black athletes who are standing up against racism, or kneeling down against racism and injustice. **You know, what are the Democrats supposed to say? Oh, we don\u2019t want to talk about it, oh it\u2019s too controversial? No! Stand up for what you believe in and what you know is right. If it costs you votes, go find the votes somewhere else.** I didn\u2019t do a good enough job fighting suppression and finding the votes somewhere else.

Beck as the top deputy in the E.P.A.'s toxic chemical unit was the most toxic appointment that any E.P.A. chief ever made in the entire history of this famous organization. \n\nYes, this is for our record that E.P.A. has never appointed anybody in the famed organization as toxic and as evil as Dr.Beck who came to the organization after working as an 'executive at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry's main trade association' .\n\nSo it's quite obvious that unless and until Dr. Beck resigns from her post, our citizens will be always at risk from dying prematurely from unforeseen diseases only because of Dr. Beck's devilish actions of allowing our chemical industries to dump dangerous chemicals like ;cholopyrifos' blamed for developmental disabilities in children,and 'methylene chloride' found in paint strippers, and 'trichloroethylene' which removes grease from metals as stated in the same article in NYT.\n\nAnd as per the same report in NYT, \"The E.P.A.'s new leadership also pressed agency scientists to re-evaluate a plan to ban certain uses of the two dangerous chemicals\" which I stated earlier.\n\nThis action by the current E.P.A. management shows to me the worst mental capacity of a man like Scott Pruitt and also the E.P.A.'s dangerous chemicals removal unit's management which is nothing but \"extremely disturbing\" as per Ms. Wendy Hamnett, an administer in the same organization who received an order to reverse the proposed pesticide ban that she introduced under Obama administration.\n\nSince the E.P.A. chief and Dr. Beck or Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for E.P.A. before she was a spokeswoman for American Chemistry council refused to answer any of the valid questions put forward to them by the NYT, they must resign immediately.\n\nAnd it's our duty as the concerned citizens of this country to call the White House or send email to the W.H. email system asking Trump to fire these 3 people immediately with Scot Pruitt as the first one to go from the post of E.P.A. Chief.\n\nWe must let Trump know that we do not want an E.P.A. Chief who wants to take us on a suicidal path by exposing us on a daily basis towards the most toxic chemicals that hide in the pesticides that we use in our gardens and in our household paints that we paint our houses with and in our dry cleaning chemicals that our dry cleaning stores use to clean our clothes with.\n\nWe must let Trump know that these three people in E.P.A. has an agenda to kill us deliberately by putting us on a death trail by allowing these evil minded chemical industry executives where these three people worked in the Administrative positions in the past, are trying to destroy our lives eventually by a stated period of time by exposing us to the most dangerous chemicals of the world on a daily basis just to help their former industry buddies."},{"author":"getbannedredddit","created_utc":1508680754,"title":"FBI says emails reveal Bill Clinton met with Vladimir Putin before the Uranium deal, and after being bribed 500000","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1508680893,"title":"House GOP Fears Wave in 2018 as Money Woes Grow","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieDarwin2","created_utc":1508681301,"title":"Exclusive: Pentagon Document Contradicts Trump\u2019s Gold Star Claims","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508687676,"title":"Superdelegates: Here To Stay?","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"heqt1c","created_utc":1508687737,"title":"Superdelegates: Here To Stay?","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1508701627,"title":"Tom Hanks: Trump's call to soldier's family 'one of the biggest cock-ups on the planet Earth'","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508701721,"title":"Doug Jones has a chance to beat Roy Moore (crosspost \/r\/AlabamaPolitics)","num_comments":3,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1508702928,"title":"Report: White House Rushed Condolences To Gold Star Families","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"LiquidSnape","created_utc":1508708662,"title":"DNC chairman aims for diversity with delegate nominations","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"KubrickIsMyCopilot","created_utc":1508710948,"title":"Trump bans American-born man from reentering US who testified against him in Russia investigation.","num_comments":139,"description":""},{"author":"MatanKatan","created_utc":1508712599,"title":"After the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Donald Trump's accusers ask why he remains unscathed -- Yes!

And he'll never let the Black people have an upper hand against him.","num_comments":0,"description":"Trump who've denigrated women all his life by forcing his lips on unsuspecting women's lips or shoving his small hands inside startled women's dresses without even bothering to ask them if it was okay, is now on his old game of tearing apart the reputation of a Black Congress Woman called Ms. Wilson by calling her 'wacky' on twitter only because she called out his very racist call to a Black widow of a slain Black soldier who died in Niger recently.\n\n\"I'm a celebrity. So they never mind or say no to me.\"\n\nThat was his stock reply to Billy Bush, the reporter of \"Access Hollywood\" when asked if the women who're insulted by his sudden groping of their body, ever complain or object to him.\n\nSo,now in this latest episode where instead of letting go of all his White trash ego that he started on the phone call to a dead Black Soldier's Black pregnant widow by not even knowing her husband's name only because he was Black, telling her about her husband in a very insulting manner like \"Your guy did this. Your guy did that\".\n\nActually his totally prejudiced mind was trying to tell her this \"Your guy knew what he was doing. So now just shut up and put up with your guy's death.\" \n\nBut since he got caught up in his stupid prejudicial game by Ms. Wilson who was present when this stupid call from him, Trump is now using his small fingers on twitter to destroy any good things that Ms.Frederick Wilson did, only because Ms.Wilson decided to go public of Trump's very racist call to the widow of Sgt. La David Wilson.\n\nTrump and his Chief of Staff are trying to nullify any good things that Ms.Wilson did like bringing the F.B.I. office in Miami,Florida after pleading with the Republican Speaker John Boehner and other Florida Republican Congress members. \n\nTrump and Mr. Kelly are trying to tell everyone that she got the F.B.I. building in Miami only by pleading to Mr. Obama who was the president at that time.\n\nYes, for Trump and his coterie of White Supremacists working in the White House, including Mr. Kelly, only way Ms.Wilson could achieve that great act was by kissing the feet of her Black friend in the White House,which is totally untrue.\n\nThey thought very mischievously that since she is Black she cannot do anything great on her own. As such they do not want to give her any credit for the fantastic job she did with the F.B.I. building.\n\nFor them, as per an article in NYT today, most of the Black people are on welfare so they can never achieve anything good,which is farthest from the truth.\n\nAs per YouGov poll 'most of the Republicans wrongly believe that Black people are welfare's largest recipients' which is totally untrue as most number of people who're on welfare are White Americans, as it is pointed out in the same article in NYT.\n\nSo it is not surprising at all that the most racist,sexist,homophobic, islamaphobic and overall a horrible human being called Donald J. Trump, who became the president of our great country only with the help of the Russian hacking, will now denigrate a Black Congress Woman to show to his base of totally racist bastards that he still hates all the Black people.\n\nAnd through his twitter feeds he's letting them know that they can be rest assured that he'll never let them down by saying or doing anything good for the Black folks of this country."},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1508761663,"title":"Gold Star widow confirms Dem lawmaker's account of call from Trump","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1508761697,"title":"Can A Dem Defeat Moore In Alabama\u00e2\u0080\u0094By Running As An Actual Democrat?","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508763128,"title":"One of the architects of the GOP\u2019s gerrymandering strategy wants to run an entire state - Virginia's gubernatorial race will have big implications for GOP voter suppression efforts.","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508764163,"title":"Thoughts?....does the pain still burn \ud83d\ude02","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"PinkSlimeIsPeople","created_utc":1508764585,"title":"What Republicans Are Really Up Against: Population Density","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1508766483,"title":"Mark Cuban May Run Against Trump In 2020 As A Republican","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"JohnRandym","created_utc":1508768099,"title":"After One Thug Punched a Policewoman, He Gets What He Deserved!","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508771468,"title":"AMA in r\/FLGovernment today (Oct. 23) - \"Free Speech For People\"","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"gioraffe32","created_utc":1508772256,"title":"AMA in r\/FLGovernment today (Oct. 23) - \"Free Speech For People\"","num_comments":0,"description":"Hi all.

Building in Miami and he knew how the money for that building was secured.\n\nKnowing the truth about how that money was secured, Mr. Kelly  should've never accused Ms.Wilson, the Democratic Congress Woman from Miami, Florida, and insulted her with a racist term by calling her \"an empty barrel\".\n\nTo Ms.Wilson and to most of the the Black Americans that 'word' is nothing but a racist term which Mr. Kelly should've known since he was born and brought up in Boston, Massachusetts in 1950.\n\nAnd as per Kelly's main intention in using that derogatory term towards Ms. Wilson, MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell suggested that \"due to Kelly's boyhood in Boston neighborhood that was largely segregated, his choice of words to describe Ms. Wilson was intentionally \"dehumaniz(ing)\" to the Congresswoman.\"\n\nFor Kelly \"she was nothing but empty barrel to him. And he refused to give her the dignity of a name\" as per O'Donnell.\n\nSo it is now absolutely necessary that Mr. Kelly apologize publicly to Ms. Wilson for insulting her Black heritage and then deliberately lying about her achievement in securing $20 million for the F.B.I. Building in Miami through Obama.\n\nHe knew jolly well that she secured that money through the Republican Speaker then John Boehner and other Florida Republicans in Congress."},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1508845810,"title":"Russia\u2019s Favored Outlet Is an Online News Giant.

Mattis who still carries some respects among the rest of the population who're not as racist bastards as most of Trump's still supporters are, should stand up to his ground instead of acquiescing Trump's regular tantrums and very childlike pronouncements like he's going to destroy completely a nuclear bomb carrying nation like North Korea not knowing what are the consequences of dropping our nuclear tipped missiles or our hydrogen bombs on a country which has spread out their nuclear bombs and their own nuclear tipped missiles,out of the reach of our tactical bombers.\n\nMr. Mattis should remind the half-child,half-man Trump that no one could drop bombs on a nuclear powered nation without causing the 'nuclear fallout' that will spread all over the world by the 'chain reaction' from all the 20+ Atomic or hydrogen bombs that Kim Jong -un  possesses under his wing.\n\nYes, it is absolutely necessary for Secretary Mattis to put into Trump's very thick brain that using those childlike rhetoric against DPRK or it's supreme leader Kim will drag our country into an unnecessary nuclear war which will not only destroy our ally in the South China sea like South Korea and Japan but will put the entire continent of Asia and huge parts of the European continent especially countries of our allies like Great Britain, Germany, France,Italy et Al, under the mushroom cloud forever, depending on the direction of the wind which will carry the highly destructive and highly thick spores of radiation from one country to another.\n\nTrump should also know that these 'radiated' clouds can reach our continent and our country too depending on which direction the upper atmospheric wind blows."},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1508932576,"title":"We Still Need the Hopey-Changey Stuff to Survive the Trump Years","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508933196,"title":"Two-person energy firm's $300 million Puerto Rico contract raises eyebrows","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"DemforLife","created_utc":1508935134,"title":"Poll: A majority of Democrats want the party to move left and oppose its leadership","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1508935922,"title":"Two-person energy firm's $300 million Puerto Rico contract raises eyebrows","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1508940744,"title":"The Manhattan US attorney's office is reportedly investigating Paul Manafort for possible money laundering","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"PinkSlimeIsPeople","created_utc":1508942612,"title":"Paul Wellstone's Ordinary Life and Extraordinary Legacy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"em_kaib","created_utc":1508943006,"title":"The Problem Of Identity Politics","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1508947184,"title":"Watch A Democratic Senator Stand In The Halls Of Congress And Call Trump A Sexual Predator","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1508950260,"title":"Fox & Friends Can't Decide Whether Sen.

I've recently returned to the community and I've discovered I couldn't be more wrong. All the local Berners still wear Bernie shirts to every event- and not from the campaign, new ones- most insultingly 'hindsight is 2020' which is so ironic it makes me want to tear my hair out. I still hear the endless hagiography regarding St. Bernie, and I still get treated like I just threw up on them if I dare to dissent, or point out they're splitting the left, or most of all, point out that some of the Berner activism online was probably partially funded by Russian interests. They are just as intellectually disingenuous as the Republicans who refuse to look that likelihood in the face because they are benefiting from it. \n\nAt this point I deeply regret being so diplomatic and non-confrontational during the 2016 election, and I've decided it's time to fight fire with fire. If the Berners somehow manage to shoehorn Bernie into the nomination in 2020, I will not vote for him. This is the first time in my life I've seriously considered a protest vote. I don't believe in them, but at this point I see nothing to lose. I'm sure I'm not the only one. Any feminist has plenty of reason to give the Berners the side eye, despite their lamentations of their perfect objectivity and victimhood. They are not our allies, by their own choice. How do they expect to win when probably 50% of Democratic women voters consider themselves feminists? The answer is, they don't. They don't seem to understand that if you can't win races basically nothing else matters. These people are not Democrats- they are infiltrators trying to take over an established party for themselves. If another term of Trump is what it takes to drive their destructive influence out of the party so be it, I'd rather lose in 2020 than see these people ride roughshod over a political system they don't understand, gleefully breaking things as they go and sanctimoniously patting themselves on the back for losing another winnable race.  \n\nI'm willing to compromise. Right now my dream 2020 ticket is Franken-Gillibrand, a slate that should be acceptable to the entire left, and quite a few moderates. Will it happen? Hell no, because it's not Bernie. The attitude of the Berners toward the last election reminds me of cultists who become MORE committed to their cult after a prophecy fails to come true. They are unreachable through reason- I feel that we have no choice but to push back through blunt action. I've come to believe that a loud and strident #neverbernie movement is the only way to salvage the party and get it back on a winning track. I will lose 'friends' over this. I will have arguments over this. I will be called crazy by Berners AND the soft nougaty center of the party, who still believe that peace and love will win the day. It's worth it. I'm done sitting back and watching a bunch of fanatics neuter my party.\n\nEDIT: this comment is being manipulated to keep the score at 0, a tactic I haven't seen since the election. Kinda proves my point. EDIT II: 7 comments, still sitting on 0 up or down votes.

southern part of our country totally White by segregating and disenfranchising the Black and other non-White communities from all walks of normal lives through extremely harsh economic and other normal activities that the all the Whites of this country enjoyed without making any efforts.\n\nAnd by not allowing the Black Americans vote in any elections, those bastards, just like the current 'White Nationalist' bastards who vote only for the Republican political candidates in our time, stopped all the Black and minority Americans right at all the polling booths by asking the Black and other minority voters huge amounts of 'poll taxes' to pay before they could cast their god given right to vote.\n\nAlso by introducing various other horribly racist measures, bastards like Jim Crow and George Wallace of Alabama made the lives of the Blacks and other  minorities,'a living hell'.\n\nAnd now this totally racist monster called Trump, whose father was nothing but a racist bastard belonging to the infamous KKK, who entered the White House only with the help of our staunchest and the oldest cold war enemy Russia, has nothing to say against the 'White Nationalists' and alt-Right members who rampaged through one of the most peaceful cities of our country called Charlottesville in Virginia,chanting all kind of old time Nazi slogans like \"Blood and soil\", \"Jews won't replace us\" et Al.\n\nYes for Trump it's okay to say all types of White Nationalist slogans against Jews, Blacks, Hispanics and people of different ethnic nationalities because for him his White Nationalist members whom he'd never condemn cannot do anything wrong even if after one of them killed a peaceful protester by running over by his car, at the same Charlottesville, VA protest in August.\n\nHe also did not condemn when one of his voters called Stephen Paddock gunned down 58+ of his own supporters and maimed 500+great Americans in Las Vegas recently.\n\nLikewise he'll never call for death sentence for one of his 'White Nationalist' bastards called Dylann Roof even after he killed 9 Black parishioners in South Carolina church recently. \n\nOn the other hand he was quick to spend a million dollars to put up a full page ad asking for death sentences for very young children called 'central park five' even though it was proved that they were nowhere near the White 'Central Park jogger' who was raped and left to die by someone in the Central Park in New York.\n\nHe did it all that then and still want to put those children on the 'Electric Chair' only because these children who're young adults now, were Black and Hispanic children then on April 19,1989 when this alleged incident happened.\n\nBut on the other hand, he'll never call these 'White Nationalists' terrorists or never propose death sentences for these 'White Nationalist bastards', majority of whom possess 'killer's mentality'  only because they voted for him overwhelmingly in the last election.\n\nGo figure

Chief who should be fired by Trump instead of spending millions of dollars for his personal security, make adults like us fall sick with 'lung cancer and Parkinson's diseases' among many other illnesses deliberately, is beyond anybody's imaginations ? \n\nThese low lives from the current E.P.A.is making all of us live through the 'Flint',Michigan Experience' where the local residents were falling sick one by one by just drinking the lead contaminated water, just because nobody cared about them only because most of them were Black Americans.\n\nGo figure !"},{"author":"CaptainMeap","created_utc":1509283387,"title":"'\"Trump Approval Drops to Lowest Level Yet in NBC News\/WSJ Poll\"","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1509283715,"title":"Trump's Approval Rating Drops to Lowest Level Yet in New NBC News\/WSJ Poll","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1509295422,"title":"Fox News Host: Lock Clinton Up","num_comments":2,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"copper95b","created_utc":1509302311,"title":"\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5BREAKING\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5 Trump also is in collusion with \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf5 North Korea!!!

There are lots of working models of different sorts of electoral systems... and if these people do consider themselves to be scientists, they shoud be talking all about these things. The election of Donald Trump shows us how weak our own electoral system is. Interestingly enough, the election of Duterte in the Philippines shows the same thing. The Philippines is a former colony of the USA, and we gave them our electoral system when we left. As I see it, the problem is the founding fathers of the USA never had the intention to have government by the people and for the people. One important person of their number talked about that... but really the bulk of these people were rich businessmen who wanted to have business leaders in control of the politics of the USA. Think about how the American Revolution started with the rejection of unfair taxation from the UK (The Boston Tea Party) . So, the government is set up so that it is ensured it is run by business leaders.\n\nThe president has such overwhelming power in the USA - one person forms an entire branch of government, singlehandedly, starting on the day he is inaugurated... and it really is the ACTIVE branch. Capitol Hill can make laws, and the court system can form an emergency check on power... but the active branch is still just that. How is he really elected? It is through a popular vote. The problem with this, is the same one where parents give their children a choice between apple juice and orange juice. It's not really a choice, now is it? They're not giving them the chance to drink soda pop, or Tang, or anything else, right? This \"invisible hand\" of the business leaders became fairly clear in the 2000 election - where both Bush and Kerry had been members of the same secret society at their university - Skull and Bones. \n\nNow... how did Trump get elected? The same way Ronald Reagan did in 1980. Both people were considered to be impossible to elect. But guess what? CNN started the first 24 hour cable television news network in the summer of 1980. Journalists in the USA have gotten deciding who the president is going to be down to a science. All you have to do in such an odd election cycle is to take the unqualified clown and give him heaps of coverage... and then that person is elected. A popular vote for one president doesn't give individuals enough of a locus of control when they cast their vote. The effect of their vote is diluted among 300 million other people's votes. Therefore, people don't take their vote seriously. They don't think of their interests when they vote for president... they treat it like a popularity contest.\n\nIn my opinion, a parliamentary system is much more effective at getting the wishes and interests of various groups in the nation represented, and giving them each a place at the policy making table. This seems counterintuitive, because there the people don't directly elect the person at the head of the executive branch. They vote for their local representative to parliament, and then the party with the most representatives in the house will be given the chance to appoint the prime minister. This actually works far better for a couple of reasons: not only do people actually take their vote seriously when they are voting for someone from their community who will represent the interests of their community, but also this system prevents gridlock. The party in power can get a lot of important things accomplished, and then if those agendas turn sour, the voters can turf that party out at the next election.\n\n\n\n"},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1509377841,"title":"Read: Statement of offense, affidavit against George Papadopoulos","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Jfklivestoday","created_utc":1509379136,"title":"Mueller makes a blockbuster move on Russia scandal","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1509380932,"title":"Trump Adviser George Papadopoulos Pleads Guilty To Lying About Russia Contacts","num_comments":4,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"clive17","created_utc":1509388447,"title":"Democrats In Full Panic After One Of Them Is Busted As KKK Member, Tried...","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1509390149,"title":"US court bars Trump from reversing transgender troops policy","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1509393208,"title":"Stay classy, GOP.","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"MatanKatan","created_utc":1509397764,"title":"Talk about special treatment: Manafort, Gates Get House Arrest After Not Guilty Pleas","num_comments":44,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieDarwin2","created_utc":1509401125,"title":"Russian content on Facebook may have reached 126 million users \u2014 far more than first disclosed, internal document says","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"KubrickIsMyCopilot","created_utc":1509401620,"title":"Worrying signals: Prosecutors don't seek jail custody of Manafort, Gates, despite being major flight risks.","num_comments":15,"description":"**Edit: Brigaded**\n\n---\n\nIn prosecutions of politically connected figures, there are broadly two kinds of indictments: Ones that are meant to go somewhere, and ones that are meant to pacify and wind down before it could touch anyone who is supposed to be untouchable.  \n\nWhen Robert Mueller took up the Russia investigation to the largely unanimous applause of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, despite the latter's absolute intransigence against holding Trump accountable for daily crimes, my default conclusion was that this would be the second type.  \n\nMueller, as you may recall, was George W. Bush's appointee to run the FBI from 2001 onward - a period of utter criminality and infamy in the history of American governance, for which not a single person has ever been brought to justice.  He was a *law enforcement* appointee of a lawless and similarly unelected \"President\" (between '01 and '04).  But in lieu of anything more substantial happening, there was no reason not to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nHowever, for all the above reasons, I predicted that Donald Trump would not be part of the indictment, nor would any current appointee - no one, in other words, that would tangibly disrupt the regime's power.  That prediction played out.\n\nIf the interpretation is correct, the indictment is meant simply to weaken and embarrass the regime, giving Congressional Republicans additional leverage with which to increase their share of the spoils of the dead republic as the regime solidifies power.\n\nA chance remains that Mueller intends to go further, but nothing in his own history or the political environment suggests that.  Now that Manafort and Gates have been arrested, rather than being as aggressive with them as possible and seeking the pressure of custody, they have agreed to mere house arrest.  Why?\n\nWhat possible motive could there be go easy on two defendants who appear to be some of the biggest flight risks in the *history* of non-capital indictments?  The thing that immediately strikes is that the prosecutors are not acting the way they would if they intended to get anything out of Manafort or Gates.  \n\nAnother possibility is they see a line they don't want to cross with other people - perhaps Trump, perhaps the GOP, or both - who would (correctly) interpret custody as a signal that they intend to be aggressive, and do not consider this a limited effort.    \n\nAt this point we are left with the desperate rationalization that they are cultivating the appearance of softball in order to do the opposite later without interference, but that borders on wishful thinking.\n\nSo understand this reality: Mueller is not there to get Trump, and he will not do so regardless of what information he uncovers.  He is there to send a message from Congress by knocking down some Trump *associates*, but nobody actually in power.\n\nIf the case expands at all, it will expand to other associates outside the regime, exerting pressure on Trump to be more of a team player in the demolition of American democracy.\n\nIt will *not* result in his indictment or impeachment, no matter what is found, because what has already occurred *in public* would have been more than enough if that were the intended result.\n\nDo not be disheartened though, ever.

cooperating\", Trump has every reason to believe that his game is over as Mr. Papadopoulos who handed over thousands of Hillary's emails to Trump campaign after July while he was still wired by Mr. Mueller.","num_comments":0,"description":"Trump has every reason to be scared now after Mr. Manafort and his partner in high crimes and misdemeanor Rick Gates who laundered more than $3 million of his own money beside his boss's $18 million that Paul received just from his Russian\/Ukrainian connection,were arrested yesterday.\n\nBut the the biggest worry for Trump now is the arrest and confession of George Papadopoulos who joined Trump's campaign in early March as a foreign policy adviser but now ridiculed by Sarah Huckabee Sanders by calling him as \"Mr. Nobody\".\n\nWhat Trump and the rest of his campaign team do not realize is how much information George passed on to Mr. Mueller's team when he supposedly was wired after his arrest in July by the F.B.I.,who called him \"proactively cooperating\".\n\nSo it's my guess as well as many Americans who follow politics that Trump is almost on the verge of being deposed as a collaborator with the Russians as far as \"colluding\" with the Putin's team of hackers are concerned.\n\nThrough the Russian professor who had direct access to Putin and the Russian intelligence officials,Mr. Papadopoulos had acquired thousands of Hillary campaign's emails in London from the male professor and as well as a very politically influential Russian woman who had direct connection to the Russian president and his circle of advisers.\n\nThese particular emails that the Russian hackers stole from Clinton's computers mainly contained about campaign infighting between two main Clinton campaign advisers John Podesta and Robby Mook as well as some other incriminating documents that all the campaign teams in this world carry, mainly opposition candidates' research materials.  \n\nGuccifer 2.0 the most famous Russian hacker and his personal team of hundreds of Russian hackers very easily extracted all these research materials from Ms.Clinton's and the D.N.C. computers that both the Democratic National Campaign Committee and the Hillary team compiled against Trump's personal characters and his wild antics in a Russian hotel.\n\nThose particular stack of stolen emails also contained personal depositions from scores of women who spelled out in clear terms how Trump in all his encounters with women in U.S. grabbed those innocent women and kissed them on their lips never asking for their consents.\n\nSo as soon as Trump and his campaign team got hold of that huge trove of incriminating emails that was stolen from Clinton Campaign's computers, Trump knew as early as June of last year that he is going to win the election on November 8th,'16.\n\nWe also can guess quite easily that Trump chose most of the emails that contained the infighting among Clinton's advisers that was easily stolen from her team's laptops, to be handed over to Julian Assange of Wikileaks through their intermediary Roger Stone. \n\nHow do we know all that ?\n\nBecause Mr. Stone always told the reporters before hand that \"in 3 day's time, you guys will learn about the infighting in Clinton Campaign team\".\n\nAnd lo and behold, in exactly 3 day's time, Mr. Assange published all the materials that was handed over to him by Mr.Stone through his personal email account that he maintained only with the owner of Wikileaks.\n\nMany of us also know that Trump kept the rest of Hillary's emails to blackmail her during the campaign, which he did very frequently.\n\nSo now since we know that he did collude with the Russians to win the last election which was Hillary's to win since she won the popular votes by more than 3 million votes, there is absolutely no doubt to any of us about exactly what happened in our country's last national election where Russia used their own influence to put their own man in our country's White House.\n\nAnd those of us who understand politics in America, this is the worst thing that could ever happen to our great 'sovereign' country.\n\nYes, because of Russia's interference in our country's election where they made a fraudster called Donald J.Trump win and become our country's president, we're no longer a 'sovereign' country. \n\nAnd that really is a very sad news for all of us."},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1509453036,"title":"NY Daily News cover","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1509453687,"title":"CNN's Chris Cuomo

But he and the Republicans didn't talk about the killing of an unborn child which they always claim to protect from the abortion doctors.","num_comments":0,"description":"If most of the Americans are aware of what is going on in this country, they would be outraged at the amount of loss of innocent lives who were doing nothing wrong but sitting in a church singing hymns with other members of their congregation which they always did every Sunday.\n\nOr listening to a country singer singing their favorite songs at an open air concert like in Las Vegas recently.\n\nOr enjoying a late night movie in a theater in Colorado few years back.\n\nOr seeing children being shot dead at their schools in Sandy Hook, CT and also in Columbine High School,CO just a few years back.\n\nActually the list goes on and on with also the murders in the inner cities and thousands of murders and suicides happening all over the country where an American is dying every 15 minutes from a gun shot wound.\n\nAnd this is happening in a country where we take pride in our preservation of human rights and the 'pursuit of life, liberty and happiness' as written almost in gold letters in our Constitution.\n\nSo the next point that should come to everybody's mind is 'where is the desire of our elected leaders, mainly in the minds of the Republican Congress members and their president Trump who only talks about the mental health of these killers instead of declaring them terrorists just because these shooters belong to his 'White Nationalist' groups.\n\nPretty soon we'll find out that this diseased shooter in Texas whom Air Force deliberately didn't even register in a national data base as a convicted felon even after he broke the skull of his step child and also for beating up his ex-wife, just because he was a White guy with Christian faith unlike a Muslim American whom the Air Force and other authorities would've definitely tagged without any mistake as they said for this shooter in Texas.\n\nYes, this shooter is as someone who should never be allowed to buy any gun in his lifetime in America. \n\nBut this 'White terrorist' killer in Texas whose Christian name should not even be uttered by any decent American, was allowed to buy 3 guns using his real I.D. without any hesitation which he used to shoot 26 people in this Church in Texas including an unborn child.\n\nAnd that is the main reason why it's laughable when Trump and his Republican cohorts in the Congress always say that they want to save all the unborn children from the knives of abortion doctors all over the country, mainly from all the Planned Parenthood centers which actually saved millions of women's lives through guidance,counselling and by providing them with free medicines including contraceptives to stop unwanted pregnancies, something that most of the patients in those clinics couldn't afford to buy on their own because of their dire economic conditions.\n\nAnd at the same time these G.O.P. members who stopped or want to stop the entire funding of P.P. see nothing wrong in taking $3+ million dollars of contributions from N.R.A., which led to this carnage including this unborn child's death in Texas and also led to all the mass shootings in this country.\n\nTalk about fake human beings !\n\nWe should not look any further than looking at all the Republican members of Congress and their crooked president Trump who are totally under the control of N.R.A. who'll do nothing to stop any  mass killings in America because that will be end of all the campaign contributions from N.R.A. \n\nYes, these crooked Republican politicians know that without mass shootings of innocent people in America, no Americans will feel the desire to buy guns to protect themselves and their families from gun violence.\n\nN.R.A. and these heartless Republicans know that more carnage like the latest one in Texas mean more demand for individual hand guns and semi automatic gun sales.\n\nAnd more demand for all kind of guns means more gun productions which will surpass even the 300 millions guns that we know of after the last count done by fthe gun manufacturers.\n\nSo now we know why the G.O.P. will never do anything to stop the next mass shooting from happening as the huge profits from each gun sales that is spread all the way through N.R.A. to each and every Republican members in all the State Capitols of the country beside Washington D.C. \n\nIt's high time that we kick all of them out from the Congress and also from the White House in next year's national election just to protect our citizens and residents from the next mass murderers which Trump and the Republicans will never do because of millions of dollars worth of contributions that generate from the gun manufactures and handed over to every members in G.O.P. through the honchos sitting in N.R.A.\n\nWhat a racket !"},{"author":"bdnavalbuild","created_utc":1510061679,"title":"Can't we all just get along for

Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive who won the Governorship by talking against the same rhetoric that made Trump win last year and also the mayoral race in New Hampshire which a Democrat won against a dividing Republican candidate, shows very clearly that Trump's bullying days, that came only because of his campaign's direct 'collusion' with the Russian intelligence services, are over.\n\nAnd we the Democrats will win all of our country's elections from now on since all of our voting machines and our Democratic Party's computers will be free from Putin and his Russian Govt's direct interference."},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1510149275,"title":"Ohio mayor who left Dem Party to back Trump goes down in humiliating electoral defeat","num_comments":19,"description":""},{"author":"FWdem","created_utc":1510150108,"title":"The Fundamentals Favor Democrats In 2018","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"FWdem","created_utc":1510150141,"title":"Dems mull big changes after Brazile bombshell","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1510152997,"title":"The G.O.P.

About 2\/3 of people on the spectrum are estimated to be suicidal (cam). They're far more likely than neurotypicals to be bullied. Their unemployment rate is commonly estimated to be between 75% and 90% (theguardian). Their average income gap compared to neurotypicals is even wider than the average income gap between men and women (drexel). Even though the majority of young adults with language and learning disabilities do live independently, less than a quarter of young adults on the spectrum do (ncbi). They're also incredibly more likely to be socially isolated than not only neurotypicals but also other people with mental disorders. There tends to be more overlap between transgender people and autistic people (theatlantic). I have previously read that their issues are largely due to their difficulties in social scenarios.

Look up what positions people want you to have, check the boxes.  Vote for $15 minimum wage, block trade, raise taxes, medicare for all.\n\nYeah, no.\n\nI'm going to make Social Security solvent and put an end to homelessness and hunger in this country in one sweep with a Universal Dividend policy.  *That*'s largely a counter-proposal against poorly-formed proposals coming out of the Universal Basic Income movement\u2014policies that suggest cutting medicare, housing assistance, and retirement benefits to get the money.\n\nI prefer EITC over minimum wage expansion, and also have a [different approach to minimum wage](https:\/\/www.johnmoserforcongress.com\/issues\/minimum-wage\/) overall whereby I increase it whenever the measure of twice the annual Dividend exceeds the current annual full-time minimum wage.  The Dividend I designed grows with productivity, meaning it grows faster than cost-of-living adjustments and CPI inflation.\n\nActually, a great majority of economists prefer EITC over minimum wage hikes, once you get over $10\/hr.  EITC takes taxes\u2014we have a progressive tax system, and even a flat tax (very bad idea) takes more income from upper-income earners\u2014and distributes them along the bottom, whereas a wage causes an increase in revenues required to make payroll.  That \"increase in revenues\" means you need to charge a higher price to pay your workers\u2014it raises the basis of price\u2014and *that* mostly impacts the middle-class (right up to the upper-middle class making $150k and some change).\n\nWhy the pin on minimum wage to a faster-than-inflation increase, then, if it tends to reduce employment?\n\nEmployment opportunities are the thing economists miss when trying to figure out the largely-abandoned Malthusian theory:  the labor market (and the population) responds to employment opportunities as a proxy for general abundance\/scarcity.  This is important, because it firmly justifies policies like DACA and other [compassionate approaches to immigration enforcement](https:\/\/www.johnmoserforcongress.com\/issues\/compassionate-immigration-enforcement\/):  you're only losing job opportunities to the *inflow* of immigrants; the ones who have been here for 2-3 years have no current impact on the unemployment rate.\n\nSo it moves slowly enough to not create an increasing unemployment rate, and it moves faster than inflation.\n\nTrade and technical progress?\n\nSame deal with the impact on the labor force.  Here's the rub:  if you lose a whole lot of employment at once, you have a whole lot of unemployed\u2014and a giant recession.  If it happens slowly, you can generally re-allocate those folks to other opportunity; many of them just go into early retirement; students come out of college later under employment pressure, and reroute their careers when markets shift a bit; and, generally, you can take care of a slow change in the job market with a strong welfare state to let these changes clean it up.\n\nImportance?\n\nIf you're facing a *fast* change\u2014new trade deals or highly-disruptive technology\u2014you may want to implement controls to slow the transition, but carry it to its stable point.\n\nIf you're facing a slow change, you want to push regulations to *enable* technology so that you don't get a back-up of hundreds of thousands of jobs ready to be replaced with machines or outsourcing.  Think self-driving cars: slowly, over time, with growth, and start replacing the workforce hopefully as fewer teenagers decide trucking is a great career around which to base their whole lives.\n\nThat has major impacts on things like globalization.  Some parties have a rhetoric about outsource jobs and globalization being bad, bad, bad.  Meanwhile, if you do the math around e.g. imported Men and Boys's Cotton Trousers from China, you find two things:\n\n* If minimum-wage workers make the pants in America, given a total cost of $3.20\/hr Chinese labor, you're looking at American minimum-wage consumers working 1.8 hours today to buy Chinese pants, and 3.0 hours to buy American pants\u2014that means *poorer*.\n* With the lower capacity to buy in total, less stuff gets shipped, retailed, etc.  When you do the math, you quickly go from \"creating a few thousand American jobs\" to \"a net loss of tens of thousands of American jobs\" as you raise that income to something reasonable, like $15\/hr.\n\nThat's right:  rich people buy bespoke clothing made by Americans; everyone in the consumer class is buying clothing made at sub-minimum-wage, and you lose jobs by bumping the cost up.  We're looking at factory workers making up less than 0.1% of the total employed; even if it was 60%, arguments that \"they'd have more money\" don't work, because they'd still invest more of their labor time in purchasing those products than they would purchasing from China.  We're shifting to a lower buying power that way.\n\nPoint?\n\nHolding back globalization creates a huge difference in potential.  Eventually, something gives out, and you lose thousands or millions of jobs all at once.\n\nLetting it run freely isn't the answer; every time you do something, you need to look at how you're going to take care of the people who are in the path of progress\u2014**we owe them for our wealth**\u2014and how you're going to minimize the amount of pain and bleeding inflicted on the economy as a whole at once.  You have to safely move to the next stable point.\n\n... things a lot of people don't want to hear.\n\nOf course the GOP likes the market argument and hates the argument that just cracking the market wide open and \"letting the job creators trickle wealth down\" won't magically make everything happen in the best way.  You'll lose your job, then they'll blame you for losing your job.  I can't fathom how these folks maintain this mode of thought.\n\nMeanwhile, many Democrats like trade\u2014and many of *those* speak loudly against trade while working out new, more-open trade deals.  Why?\n\n*Because the unions have a serious hatred for and poor understanding of global trade.*\n\nThat's where I am as a candidate:  I find the problems people face, I look to solve them, but what they get as a solution\u2014while it *does* address the problem\u2014does not look at all like what they expect.\n\nI feel like I'm drifting off alone here."},{"author":"FLTA","created_utc":1510625790,"title":"Despite Recent Wins for Democrats, Gerrymanders Dim Hopes for 2018","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1510626672,"title":"The Trump Presidency: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"rhones321","created_utc":1510628109,"title":"Bill Clinton: A Reckoning","num_comments":43,"description":""},{"author":"data2dave","created_utc":1510632574,"title":"Doug Jones for U.S. Senate","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"SocialBrushStroke","created_utc":1510633570,"title":"\u201cI needed the money,\u201d @donnabrazile says, and waves her book at the audience.","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"someotherdudethanyou","created_utc":1510636321,"title":"Taxpayers for Billionaires","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1510637415,"title":"Dems: GOP tax reform a political 'gift' for Democrats","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1510641289,"title":"Note to Republicans - You Can't Boycott Something You Already Bought","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"Druidshift","created_utc":1510642881,"title":"The Alabama Special Election: Repeat after me....","num_comments":2,"description":"Your vote matters.

Sanders meant mainly Putin's actions when he said that.\n\nSo I, as a longtime member of the Democratic party and after voting for Hillary in the last election, strongly believe that Bernie Sanders who's a self-described \"democratic socialist\" and a \"New deal-era American progressive\" should use his influence to ask his followers to join hands with our Democratic party members to say in unison that Hillary lost her election last year because of Russian meddling in our electoral process beside whatever Bernie's supporters think about whatever she lacked as a candidate.\n\nSen.Sanders also must declare to his followers that the Russia investigation that is going through in the Congress and outside by Mr. Mueller should go through its full course until Trump is forced to resign from his presidency that he didn't deserve to win. Hillary did.\n\nAnd that statement by Mr. Sanders will definitely make us all in the Democratic party happy as we strongly believe like many in the Republican party's 'Never Trump' movement including Sen.

years that unfolded on Tuesday in the Senate was really a welcoming sign that our elected officials have finally come to their senses like most of the leading psychiatrists of our country have already concluded that Trump is a mad man who's delusional to the point of possessing the mind of a child of ten years when it comes to the point of taking an important decision to carry out a nuclear attack without any provocation from North Korea or any other rogue nation.\n\nSo it is really the duty of the Republican led Congress to pass this measure in both the chambers of Congress to take the power

I have watched America's political landscape get meaner every election.  Something happened in the wake of the Nixon administration that has been with us since, and some political operatives are willing to do anything to win an election - any representation of the actual citizens be damned.\n\nI doubt any of us here would agree with the trope some try to push that \"both sides are just as bad.\"  We know that's crap.  Do we have representatives that take money they shouldn't and so on?  Of course.  But the Democrat side doesn't heave near the rate of scandal that the Republicans do.  That's objectively true; I'm not going to debate that point.\n\nWhen it comes to the subject of sexual harassment, I believe a lot of us would agree that it's wrong, and we all need to be part of the solution.  \n\nI believe the woman who claims that Al Franken kissed her once when she didn't want him to, and of course the picture of him gesturing like he's grabbing her breasts is what it is.  It's clear he didn't grope her, though, so let's dispense with that exaggeration of hers; we can all see in the photo what happened.   I believe he drew devil horns on a picture of hers.  So, yeah, Franken was an asshole to her.  Since the unwanted kiss and the gesture were sexual in nature, we can even go ahead and call it sexual harassment.  \n\nHowever, (you could see this from a mile away, I'm sure) is it the same as someone who persists in unwanted lecherous behavior, and goes to the point of actual sexual acts, such as jacking off in front of someone to their horror, or truly groping them, or aggressively targeting underage girls?  I think they're different.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I shoplifted a pen because a group of kids were doing the same and selling them for almost nothing at school.  Fountain pens were a smallish fad at the time, and since this was a cheap and easy way to get one, it was a sign of how cool you were in school.  I was never cool, so when I tried to buy one, I was told I wasn't cool enough to have one.  Since I couldn't afford what they really cost, I shoplifted one.  I was happy for about a week until my conscience reminded me I wasn't that sort of person.  I'd rather be uncool than a thief.\n\nNow, was my teenage indiscretion the same thing as breaking into a house or store window and stealing a TV?  Kind of, but not really.  There is a reasonable scale that matches the level of the crime to the punishment.  Our justice system recognizes that with the gradations of  a misdemeanor vs. a felony, and even levels within those. \n\nTo me, Franken committed a misdemeanor as opposed to Ray Moore who should be in prison sucking cock. The Republicans are delighted that some Democrats are happily crowing that Franken is just as bad.  For good reason (from their perspective), because Franken is a good congressmen who has a high profile, given his past.  It would be wonderful for them to have him out of the way, as he's one of the best at calling their bullshit.   Dig a little into the past and politics of the woman who's accusing Franken, and you'll see she's most likely a paid operative for their party.   Why else would Roger Stone[ tip their hand](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/roger-stone-appears-to-have-known-about-al-franken-allegations-hours-before-they-went-public\/) 12 hours before the story broke? It was planned. \n\nSo, when [Kirsten Gillibrand](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/politics\/wp\/2017\/11\/17\/kirsten-gillibrand-says-bill-clinton-should-have-resigned-as-old-allegations-resurface\/) [[link 2](http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/11\/17\/politics\/kirsten-gillibrand-bill-clinton\/index.html)] and Matthew Yglesias call for Franken's resignation, I just shake my head in wonder at the lack of judgment on their part.  How could they be so daft?  We're clearly being played. \n\nGillibrand even goes so far as to help out the Republicans with their hate boner against Bill Clinton.  This week someone wrote in an article that his extramarital affair with Lewinsky was technically sexual harassment since he was her powerful boss.  Well, bullshit.  I mean, I understand how that can be and is the case in many circumstances when a boss says fuck me or lose your job.  That happened to my ex-wife, and he was a lawyer so she knew she had no legal recourse (and she didn't fuck him for those playing along, and yeah, she lost her job.)  It's a real problem.  But by her own admission and the fact that she kept the dress with the presidue on it (\"presidue\" was coined by Bill Maher),  this was entirely a consensual sexual relationship.  We harm ourselves and we dishonor Clinton and Lewinsky when we claim it was sexual harassment. \n\nAl Franken has apologized and moved to make the amends he can. He should not resign.  We should not ask him to.  If you live in Minnesota, I hope you vote him back in.  Leave the Clinton-hating to the wingnuts.  Show some intelligence and discernment.  Defend Al Franken for being the good if not great Senator he is.  Let wingnuts continue their sad, lost mission against Clinton with nothing but pity from us. \n\nShow some discernment and understanding of context, the facts, and how the Republicans use us against ourselves.  Let's not do that any longer. \n\ntl;dr: Al Franken's sexual harassment barely meets the criterion of the same by any reasonable standard.  To let the right use this against us is sheer stupidity on our part.   And to even mention Bill Clinton any more in a negative light is more stupidity.  In sum, he was a good president.  We should behave as such.  Support Al Franken against this disproportionate attack.

Assembly members give for these young girls carrying so many children even before they reached their puberty was just as scandalous as their entire preaching is.\n\nTheir only explanation for the abuse of these young girls is : Jesus said so. \n\nThat to me is nothing but totally bullshit after having read almost every literature on Jesus, not finding one instance where Jesus preached to his followers that these young girls who in some states like Alaska, Louisiana and South Carolina are as young as 12 years old, should be allowed to marry of their own choice often to much older men than them.\n\nAs per an article in NYT published in May of this year,\" an 11 year old girl who was refused to be married by a government clerk in Tampa,Fla, even though it was legal in the state, was driven to Pinellas County by her family as she was not allowed to drive, where the clerk issued her a marriage licence\", which to me is nothing but a crime which these Republicans in the Red states like Florida are committing with the full approval of their conservative priests and conservative preachers of their conservative churches. \n\nBut on the other hand just to maintain the purity of their White race, these same Republican lawmakers of the Red states along with the preachers and the priests of their Red leaning churches are making sure that no Blacks and other minorities live and vote in their states by disenfranchising them from the voter rolls on many pretexts like for having past felony charges.\n\nThese Republicans in these Red states try to entangle the Black and other minority state people into some trumped up felony charges even if those infractions stemmed from not being to able to pay the fake traffic tickets issued by the totally racists cops working in the Red states just to keep the Black and Brown citizens of these conservative states behind bars and not allowing them to vote on the stupid pretexts of them having felony records.\n\nThese Republican lawmakers in all the Red states also use their gerrymandering practices to keep all the Black citizens and other minorities living in their conservative states' counties and districts and cities to make sure the minority people's votes will not make any differences to make the Democratic candidates win even if these African-Americans and other minorities are somehow able to vote as per their constitutional rights.\n\nAnd that makes Democrats like us so mad when we find that our own Democratic members' votes have no value by the way these corrupt Republican politicians are disenfranchising our own Democratic voters with the help of their cohorts in the Conservative churches who're totally immoral as far as preaching by Jesus is concerned. \n\nHope they all burn in hell for what they do in their Red states to keep our men out of the polling booths and to keep their young girls into a life of slavery by making them pregnant when they're barely 11 or 12 years old just to gain political advantage over our Democratic politicians who depend solely on their Democratic voters."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1511103120,"title":"GOP Tax Bill Is The End Of All Economic Sanity In Washington","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1511103597,"title":"GOP Tax Bill Is The End Of All Economic Sanity In Washington","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"symonsymone","created_utc":1511106667,"title":"I Opposed Bill Clinton\u2019s Impeachment and I Don\u2019t Regret It","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1511110170,"title":"White House officials just called losing your health insurance a tax break: 13 million more Americans will be uninsured so corporations can get a tax cut.","num_comments":15,"description":""},{"author":"Anticipator1234","created_utc":1511110437,"title":"Come Back, Barack -

totally prejudiced president Trump plan to repeal Obamacare and replace with their own Trumpcare plan which is nothing but an evil exercise just to remove Obama's legacy from an important legislation only because it was passed by a Black president.\n\nAnd now with the estimate given by the Congressional Budget Office that 'eliminating Obamacare's individual mandate will cause 13 million more people become uninsured',as per a quote in an article in NYT today, should give the rest of the Republicans a pause.\n\nAlthough the same C.B.O. has indicated that they'd look into the estimate number again next year to see if they've made any mistake, doesn't give the Republicans any joy at the new lower figure of the number of people uninsured which might or might not come out after the new estimate is done in 2018.\n\nThe damage to our insurance market is already done with most of the insurers now saying they'd leave particular markets like in Nebraska where the premium for the single customers will rise by $600 per month, with \"the effect on their bottom line is more significant\" as per the same article, which I strongly agree.\n\nNo wonder 'Senators like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and other Senators whose votes may be needed to pass the tax bill, have some concern about the premium increases' as per the article in NYT.\n\nAnd that is the main reason why I believe this Republican health care bill should be scrapped before it comes to vote.\n\nThere is no need to waste the Senators' time and more money just to conduct any more exercise in finding the earlier estimate lower.\n\nThe Americans in general are totally tired of the Republicans in congress and their president Trump trying to dismantle Obamacare just because of our last president's color of the skin.\n\nIt's better if Trump and this Republican party members leave our great country which was turning more diverse than before when Obama was the president .\n\nThese low life Republicans and their president Trump who is nothing but a leech should take their racism out of this country and practice them in some European country if they find one.\n"},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1511187804,"title":"Roy Moore Accuser: \u2018This Isn\u2019t Political For Me, This Is

Meanwhile his defenders say \"we have no evidence, innocent until proven guilty. SAD!\"\n\nSo the strategy? find anybody who can get dirt on a democrat in Washington who has something damning and wait for them to say \"THIS IS FALSE!\"\n\nPretty clever actually. But Al Franken KNOWS this. \n\n\nI want to focus on the motives and strategy of the right, but i have to quickly address the evidence for both cases.\n\nPersonally, I don't think Al stuck his tongue down her mouth. I'll get to why in a sec, but while a practice kiss might or might not have taken place, i doubt she was hesitant, or i doubt she minded etc. Or it didn't happen, I don't know. \n\nHowever, the picture is pretty hard to get past. He is clearly holding his hands up an inch over her  1.5\" kevlar. She claims \"he groped me\". So my first reaction was \"well you can't see him groping her here but maybe he groped her a second after this picture\". Until she said she didn't know about it until she saw the picture... meaning she wouldn't KNOW she was groped. So the picture is literally the ONLY thing we have. There's some talk that the person who took the picture said she was aware the picture was being taken and she was posing, but its not confirmed yet so we can't trust it. \n\nBack to the point, she SAID she saw him a couple years later at an event... and that she was ghosting him and giving him the cold shoulder, and that he had the chance to apologize and didn't. How would he have the chance to apologize if she was avoiding him? \n\nFactor in Roger Stone AND sean hannity both alluding to this happening before it dropped.\n\nAnd now this new allegation. I'll get to why I don't believe THIS one either, but I have a couple friends up in minnesota. They've had some friends who say some group has been going door to door (they suspect its linked to breitbart but i can't confirm) asking anyone under the sun if they have any contact with franken and would be able to concoct an allegation. \n\nI looked at that picture of al with that girl. She looks happy as a clam. She's all close up against him, he seems pleasant but not particularly interested, and according to her, it only took about 3-4 seconds to snap the shot then they separated. Her claim that he grabbed her ass? i just honestly don't see it. I would only see it if he were making a joke. but in a crowded place? Not looking particularly joky? I just don't see it. \n\nBut anyway, i'm 100% positive the first accuser didn't think anything of it until her close personal friend sean hannity saw the picture and asked her to say something about it. \n\nSame goes for the trump voter who alleges he grabbed her. Did his hand fall to low? I can't really say, i've taken pictures where my hand was at the waist. And if he was doing it quickly, maybe it went a couple inches lower than intended. She described where his hand was and it seemed to me that it was just (according to her) a little ways off the mark. \n\nBut back to the topic. They got their couple accusers. But they don't plan on taking franken down. Thats not the point. He'll be replaced by another democratic senator. They WANT him to deny these accusations and give credence to Roy Moore. \n\nThey want him to say \"we don't have evidence\". \n\nBut al knows better than that. He apologized, and asked for an investigation. HE knows it will exonerate him as soon as the senate starts asking questions from people who took the first photo. but it will happen after roy moores election.\n\nPlease don't be fooled. He CAN'T defend himself without inadvertently denying moores accusers as well. And none of the other people on late night can defend him either. Seth meyers, colbert, trevor noah, snl. I know THEY all think he's innocent. but they HAVE to show we always believe the accuser FIRST. Its virtue signaling. \n\nDon't let them win.  #ImwithAl #StaywithAl #StandwithAl"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1511226775,"title":"The White House Statement on Roy Moore","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1511230237,"title":"Why the GOP's Wealthy Tax Giveaway Will Work","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1511232456,"title":"O\u2019Malley tells Dems not to fear Trump","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"amonhenweathertop","created_utc":1511237000,"title":"White house petition: Opposition to taxation of graduate student tuition waivers and remissions.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"BrianNowhere","created_utc":1511237988,"title":"There's a lot of feminists and SJW on the left calling for Al Franken to resign.

I've seen it all.\"\n\nNow which adult person will do that by walking into the green room of young underage girls unless they've some sinister motives like Trump and also Roy Moore had when he put his lustful eyes on a fifteen year old contestant in a beauty pageant and later on marrying the same girl who's still his wife standing shamelessly next to him, defending his gross sexual behavior with another 15 year old almost at the same time he put his sex hungry eyes on his wife when he was 30 years old.\n\nAnd this incidents are beside the accusations of a fourteen year old  girl then from Alabama who has no fear in saying openly on the national tv., that Roy Moore slept beside her while naked and fondled her while he was 30+ years and just out of the military.\n\nMy question to Mr. Moore is if he was a judge like we know he was, why he has not filed libel charges against these women so far ?\n\nWhat's holding him from pursuing legal courses against these women ?\n\nI like many citizens of this country are quite convinced that since there was no legal action taken by against any of these women by anyone, Mr. Roy Moore is guilty as hell just like Trump was when he abused hundreds of innocent women by his own account.\n\nYes, as per the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, he took full advantage of his celebrity status, touching in sexual ways all the unsuspecting women at his will and kissing directly in their mouth without bothering to ask for their permission. \n\nThat is the reason why I think both of these adult males, Trump and Roy Moore should be charged to the fullest degree of the law by our court system with Trump being removed from the office of the presidency through impeachment.\n\nAnd Roy Moore should be denied his chance to run for the senate seat vacated by another crook in the trump administration, Jeff Sessions who has courted our country's worst enemies of all time Russian Ambassador to the United States and all the Russian Counter-intelligence officials through Mr. Kislyak and allowed them to intervene in our election openly just to make a confirmed abuser of women called Trump become our country's president.\n\nShame on all three of these people I mentioned above for destroying our great country's integrity and sovereignty."},{"author":"monsoony","created_utc":1511357796,"title":"\u2018Trump is a stupid man\u2019s version of a President\u2019: Internet pelts Trump for \u2018poor man\u2019s Don King\u2019 attack on LaVar Ball","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"samitasarkar","created_utc":1511358212,"title":"Thoughts on Feminist Trump Voters, Elephant Trophies (Video)","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1511366030,"title":"In Trump strongholds, Democrats walk tightrope ahead of 2018 elections","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BumBiddlyBiddlyBum","created_utc":1511371390,"title":"The reality about net neutrality.

only the Blacks and minorities with the pretext of clearing the list of dead and absentee voters, as they know the Blacks and minorities vote mainly for the Democratic candidates.","num_comments":0,"description":"If Jim Crow was alive today, he could be the happiest man to see that the rules that he imposed starting in 1896 with a \"separate but equal\" status for African Americans in all walks of life in America, are still being kept alive and well today in 2017's America by the Republican party.\n\nBut the irony is, those rules were implemented by the White Southern Democrats in Alabama where Jim Crow was a Democratic governor whereas those same rules are being used by the members of the current Republican party who're implementing one rule after another to purge the voter rolls saying they're clearing the names of the dead people and the people who've moved out from their states.\n\nBut what they're not telling us that they're trying to purge from the voter rolls only the names of the Black and other citizens of this country in their Red states and not the names of any White voters.\n\nTo be absolutely clear here that not a single White voter's name  has been purged so far from these voter lists by the members of the Republican party.\n\nAnd the law that was implemented that mainly stated that \"no citizen with a past criminal record will be allowed to vote in any of our elections\", are solely being implemented by the current Republican governors and other lawmakers in the Republican controlled states like in Ohio as they know that it's mostly the Black and other minority citizens who're languishing in our jails because of the totally racist and very stringent laws supported and passed by the Republicans in congress in Washington.\n\nAs each of those ex-convicts who comes out of the jails after many years after his or her wrongful incarcerations on mostly trumped up charges filed by our racist cops, they lose their rights to vote even though they're still citizens of this country. \n\nThe Republicans in congress won't allow anyone with a past felony record to vote in this country as they know in their hearts that the most of these voters who would be either Blacks or other minorities, would only vote for the Democratic candidates. \n\nNo wonder the racist bastards in the Republican party want only the White votes as they do not consider the Blacks and the minorities as human beings and as such have no intention ever to court the Black and minority votes. \n\nYes, it is the same old Republican party, which fought the Civil War to repeal slavery from America under the leadership of the G.O.P.'s best president called Abe Lincoln, is now a party that wants to abandon all of their principles that their party was founded on.\n\nActually the current Republican party is nothing but a distant shadow of it's old self and in general have become the most intolerant of all the races in this country.\n\nFor these low lives, the color of a person's skin determines who gets to live in this country and vote as the Jim Crow laws are now the laws of the current Republican party under their illegitimate president Trump.\n\nAnd although Jim Crow was a Democrat but these racist Americans who're running the Republican party are enacting one law after another in mostly the Republican controlled states which are nothing but laws that would've made Jim Crow and George Wallace, another southern racist Democratic governor from the state of Alabama whose mantra was \"segregation now, Segregation forever\", very proud.\n\nBoth the above governors who believed in total restrictions on the Black and minority citizens of their states will be happy to see that the current Republican party is purging the voter rolls of all the \"minority,poor and young voters,who are disproportionately Democrats\", as it's written in the same article in today's NYT."},{"author":"VegaThePunisher","created_utc":1511704793,"title":"Happy Thankstaking.","num_comments":15,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1511713896,"title":"Showdown Over

A Republican Congress can be replaced, and legislation passed by it can be reversed...**or struck down by a law-abiding Judiciary.**  But once the courts are full of illegitimate judges - corrupt, fanatical insurgents foaming at the mouth to dismantle the American republic - none of that becomes possible.\n\nWhy?  Because...\n\n* They will make prosecuting Trump and his accomplices impossible, ruling in their favor on all matters until the law ceases to exist.\n\n* They will rule that anything Trump and his accomplices do is legal.\n\n* They will allow prosecutions of Trump's enemies for anything and everything, casting aside all precedent, procedure, and law for naked kangaroo court behavior, and wield the full extent of arbitrary judicial power against the American people.\n\n* They will strike down all laws Trump wants to be struck down, and issue totalitarian interpretations of ones that remain.\n\n* They will use their ability to interfere in the progress of other, more mundane cases as leverage against the remaining legitimate judges, threatening to bring federal jurisprudence to a screeching halt if their demands on political cases are not met.  They will blackmail real judges on some cases to force acceptance of their own illegal actions on others.\n\nBut there is another way - one that carries risk: **All proceedings set to occur before Trump-appointed judges must be boycotted as illegal.**    \n\nIt's justifiable within legal ethics because, frankly, **the outcomes are predetermined**, and attorneys must recognize that hard truth and loudly protest it by refusing to participate in the farce.\n\nAnd it must go even further than that: All rulings of theirs must be ignored as invalid, having no role in American jurisprudence; all summonses issued by them ignored; and all warrants issued by them refused in lieu of being countersigned by a legitimate judge.\n\nThis is an ugly and frightening reality, but if the American legal profession and people fail to offer this kind of resistance on a significant level, then there is virtually no possibility of avoiding outright dictatorship.  \n\nWith the Trump insurgency having a significant and growing presence on the courts, accountability within the existing structure would be impossible: The Constitutional structure would have been subverted in total, enforcement of any kind against them impossible, and **resistance of any kind to them criminalized**.\n\nBut there is a little bit of time left.  Time for attorneys with cases before these judges to save their profession and their country by refusing to attend proceedings before them; by stating categorically that these judges are not legitimate, carry no authority under the law, and will be rejected no matter what threats they make or attempt to impose by force.\n\nHere is a current listing of \"judges\" nominated by Donald Trump, showing which have already been empaneled and which are still in process:\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Donald_Trump\n\nThese are not judicial authorities.  They are insurgents, exercising illegally-obtained power through the auspices of an unelected tyrant.  And if their nonexistent authority is accepted by the legal profession, there is very little hope that the law will survive.\n\nThis is the stark reality we face.

Now, how do these facts connect into a possible Direct Democracy path toward Amendment?\n\nIt begins with the 18 states with initiative processes capable of changing the state constitution - i.e., the document that establishes the structure and obligations of its legislature.  **Article V of the US Constitution does not prescribe in what manner the legislatures decide on their vote**, so theoretically the voters of these 18 states can pass a resolution requiring their legislatures to refer the vote on a federal Amendment to a ballot initiative and then simply rubber-stamp the outcome in the legislature.\n\nIf this were done, the citizens of these states would have direct control of over 1\/3 of legislatures involved in the Constitutional process, or almost **half the way to passage**.  This would mean that, the citizens of these states together would directly hold as much power as 139 House Representatives and 32 Senators.\n\nLet that sink in.  The *citizenry* would hold this power.  **Direct power** over the US Constitution.\n\nNow, that is not enough to pass an Amendment by itself if the opposition in other states is strong, but you're **halfway there**, so with no other reforms in other states, you would have to convince 20 other legislatures.  That is still a tall order, but much more doable.\n\nHowever, we absolutely can bring more states into the fold - those with ballot initiative processes who don't yet give them authority over the state constitution can change that.  \n\nHalf (four) of these limited-referendum states are Blue states (Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, and Washington), and two of the remainder (Alaska and Wyoming) have idiosyncratic politics that sometimes favors devolution of power to the public.  \n\nBoth in the latter two and in the remainder, appeals to single-issue conservative constituencies (particularly social conservatives who think they would make greater headway via enhanced ballot authority) might be sufficient to push them to extend state constitutional authority to the ballot process, and it's an easier trip from there to binding the legislature to referendum results on a federal Amendment.\n\nThen there are the remaining 24 states with no ballot referendum process whatsoever.  It is a longer climb, but the same sequence of steps and tactics could bring along some of them, and there is nothing that *inherently* prevents all of them from being persuaded to have some measure of ballot process; then getting them to enhance it, or else (if configured to allow it) having the ballot process enhance its own power by referendum; and finally to pass the specific legislature-binding resolution.\n\nIf the 26 states with ballot initiatives are brought to full authority, only 12 more would be required for the citizenry (at least of those 38 states) would have **direct control over the US Constitution**, provided their majorities were unanimous on a question.  And lack of unanimity could be supplemented from among the remaining 12 unbound legislatures.\n\nTo summarize, these are the steps for the American people to obtain direct power over the US Constitution, and each step - in fact, each state that takes the step - makes the Amendment process more democratic in and of itself even if no further effort succeeds:\n\nOnly needs to pass a ballot initiative binding the legislature to a public vote on a federal Amendment:\n\nArizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, and South Dakota.\n\nMust enhance limited ballot initiatives to state constitutional authority, then pass a legislature-binding resolution:\n\nAlaska, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, Wyoming.\n\nOnly **12 of the following** required to enact some kind of ballot process, enhance it to constitutional authority if not already in initial implementation, and then pass a legislature-binding referendum:\n\nNew Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Kansas, Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama.\n\nOne modification might be useful in some cases: Instead of a resolution binding the legislature to refer an Amendment, the resolution could allow a legislature some flexibility - e.g., to pass an Amendment rejected by the voters given a supermajority, or to veto a vote in favor given a supermajority.  That might convince some skeptical states to move forward."},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1512149119,"title":"ABC: Flynn to Testify Trump Ordered Him to Talk to Russians","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"BriannaMaryrose","created_utc":1512149377,"title":"If you have ever wanted to ask a Millenial conservative a question, now is your time!","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Uhillbilly","created_utc":1512151434,"title":"How Millennials Are Trying To Revive The Labor Movement","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"KubrickIsMyCopilot","created_utc":1512151753,"title":"Steve Bannon and Members of Trump\u2019s Inner Circle Stash Investments in Offshore Tax Havens","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"1cognoscere","created_utc":1512153711,"title":"Honest question to Democrats: Do you believe Trump is guilty of treason?

And it ended proving Republicans bigger sexual predators than Democrats","num_comments":7,"description":"Republicans hated everything about Bill Clinton and tried everything to try and remove or drive him from office. As a radicalized NRA lobbied to allow inexpensive assault weapons to flood into the country from former Soviet block countries, militia groups began to form in the backwaters of ignorance and poverty. An endless train of ridiculous conspiracy theories concerning black helicopters carrying UN troops to enslave Amerika was spread by talk radio like Rush Limbaugh and Art Bell. An American Nazi blew up a federal building killing hundreds including children in a daycare. Maybe he thought it was a child sex trafficking ring, but I don't think the state of insanity had reached that level yet. And all without the Internet as we know of it most of that time. \n\nAnd still Clinton gave every indication he would remain in office. Then a series of mostly unproven allegations regarding real estate swindles (Whitewater) and a string of allegations of sexual impropriety followed. Some of these were proven and admitted to. Others were either disproved or never proved. They all hound Bill Clinton to this day but they were not, despite the expenditure of millions of tax payer dollars and long interruptions in governmental operation able to prove allegations and remove Clinton.\n\nTo make things worse, when the Republican congress tried to select prosecutors to impeach Bill Clinton, they only ended up exposing even more sordid lives of their intended henchmen. Bob Livingston, it was revealed had an affair while married. Clinton critic Helen Chenworth had her six year affair with a rancher neighbor in Oregon where she lived. Senator Henry Hyde was found to have had a 5 year affair with a married woman with 3 children that seems to have broken up the woman's marriage. Newt Gingrich, after dumping his cancer suffering wife for a younger woman. Shortly after remarrying Newt started an affair with a house staffer 20 years younger than him who he married after divorcing his second wife in the midst of the affair.\n\nThis series of affairs left the Republicans losing interest in further persecution or prosecution of Bill Clinton for fear what further moral outrages might be uncovered among their hallowed numbers. But the Republicans have never forgotten and have waited patiently for their chance to *get back* for all the embarrassment  that failed attempt at burning a Democrat president at the stake left them with.\n\nNow there is a campaign to unearth any stray hand placement or inappropriate peck or risque statement to hold Democrats to account for. The effect leaves me with the impression that something is selectively motivating these *MEETOO* women to come forth decades after their buttocks was touched or possible groping took place. We've already seen evidenciary proof that social media, sometimes using stolen voter databases, have been used to selectively influence individual voters to vote a certain way. It would not seem too presumptuous to assume the same people who engineered the social media voter influence campaign could have monitored social media for discussion of sexual misconduct, then had fake social media personas **\"friend\"** these people (known to have associated with Democratic office holders) and urge them to take the *METOO* challenge. Most people don't know how easy this could be done with enough trolling monkeys pounding away in some kine of *factory* somewhere say.\n\nThe timing of the release of the long, long standing Harvey Weinstein scandal is suspect as well.\n\nI do not intend to lessen the importance of the women coming forth to tell their stories of being sexually abused. I'm certain almost all of them are telling their true stories. I am only questioning whether some of the revelations are being slanted to benefit only one side of the political agenda. I hope the revelations continue - in an objective, unbiased manner."},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1512604370,"title":"Sen.

I've been a life-long Republican (mostly in name only due to growing up in an area that has been Republican since Reconstruction), but I don't know that I can continue to support them. But I also don't know whether I'd be welcome in the Democratic Party either if I didn't toe the line on certain issues.\n\n-- I consider myself a feminist (as a guy), because I want my wife and daughter to have the exact same opportunities in life as me.\n-- I support public education. I'm a product of it. I also support improving higher education. I'm a first generation college student from a low-income, rural Southern family who beat the statistics and now have a doctoral level degree. I think others should do be able to do that as well.\n\n-- I supported the ACA and its goals and think we should tweak it and potentially introduce a public option to improve the insurance market in general.\n\n-- I support immigration, I believe in climate change and am active in conservation issues, I support LGTBQ issues, etc. \n\nWhere I may differ: \n-- I consider myself pro-life. More specifically, whole-life. I don't particularly want to debate the abortion issue, other than to say while opposing elective abortion (with appropriate exceptions of the life of the mother, etc), I also support broader efforts to help women during and after the perinatal period both with insurance, in the workplace, and in educational settings to help them to achieve their goals. I also supported broader access to contraception. The original suffragists were almost uniformly opposed to abortion, so I believe there is a place for pro-life views within the feminist movement (as do a lot of others). I don't know if the national party would accept this view, however.\n\n-- I'm a moderate on firearms\/gun control. I'm supportive of closing the background check loopholes. I believe that those convicted of domestic violence should lose their ability to purchase\/own firearms. I would support a ban on high capacity magazines. I'm also a gun owner myself and a hunter. I'm skeptical of the effectiveness of \"assault weapons\" bans but open to them. \n\n-- I'm mostly supportive of free-trade at least ideologically, but I believe it must be tempered with judicious but fair regulation to prevent monopolization and oligarchy.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I would be interested in hearing the thoughts of active Democrats as to whether I would be welcome in the party. I don't put much of my personal identity into party allegiance, but it would be nice to feel as though some group out there aligned somewhat with my societal and political viewpoints."},{"author":"StompYouHard","created_utc":1512747790,"title":"The Republican War on Children","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1512749817,"title":"Email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents: Candidate Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and others in the Trump Organization received an email in September 2016 offering a decryption key and website address for hacked WikiLeaks documents.","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1512749903,"title":"Email shows effort to give Trump campaign WikiLeaks documents: Candidate Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and others in the Trump Organization received an email in September 2016 offering a decryption key and website address for hacked WikiLeaks documents.","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1512752391,"title":"1 The curious timing of Trump Jr.\u2019s first Wikileaks tweet: Donald Trump Jr. received an email offering a decryption key and website address for hacked WikiLeaks documents he claims to have no recollection of.

I was also adopted at birth. Abortion and adoption policies are deeply personal issues for me. \n\nOne the most frustrating aspects about the Democratic party is how they throw away millions of votes every election cycle because they embrace the false dichotomy that has become the abortion debate in America.\n\nDemocrats, it\u2019s ok to say abortion should be rare. It's ok to admit it's a morally difficult subject. You can admit those things and still be pro-choice and an advocate for women. \n\nAt the end of the day Dems, *we really want the same thing that the pro-life movement wants.* We should want to see abortion rates as low as possible. A high abortion rate is NOT an indicator of a healthy and prosperous nation. 75% of women who get an abortion live at or below the poverty line. *What are we about if not fighting poverty?!* \n\nWe can still advocate the necessity of woman's right to choose, while simultaneously making the link in voter's minds that progressive policies *as a whole* (single payer healthcare, safety net programs, funding higher education, increased contraception) would do more to reduce abortion rates than a Republican-proposed outright ban of the procedure. \n\nBut again and again, our party's leaders play into the same false dichotomy that has steered this debate for decades: that you are either pro-life or pro-choice. That you have to pick either women or the infants inside them. Republican leaders *love* this. They fully embrace this dichotomy, and reap the benefits from it. Meanwhile, we lose election after election to bullies and pedophiles. Many of the people who will vote for Roy Moore are appalled by him, but in their minds they think it is better to send a pedophile than a \"baby killer.\" That is OUR fault for not having better messaging. We have allowed Republicans to steer the course of the conversation, and we have played into it. \n\nWhat if we could convince single-issue voters not to vote Democrat *in spite* of their pro-life convictions, but *because* of them?\n\nWhen asked about abortion during the next presidential debate, what if instead of our Democratic nominee repeating canned lines about women's health in a tone-deaf manner that only plays to our base and turns off millions of voters across the country, our candidate said this:\n\n\"I have this discussion with myself every day. It's a difficult one to have. But at the end of the day, I ask myself this: Let's suppose I had to wake up tomorrow and choose one of two worlds to live in. In world #1, abortion has been outlawed, but nothing else has changed; meaning that many women still get abortions, just illegally. In world #2, abortion is still technically legal, but we have universal healthcare, increase access to contraception, increase the minimum wage, and increase access to higher education. Which of these two worlds would have a LOWER abortion rate? I am convinced it is world #2. And that is why I vote democrat, because I am pro-life.\" "},{"author":"KubrickIsMyCopilot","created_utc":1512775077,"title":"What forcing Franken out says to the American people.","num_comments":3,"description":"This is the message of Franken's resignation under pressure from fellow Democrats:\n\n* We care more about purging our Party of negative zeitgeist than about protecting your healthcare.\n\n* We care more about this than about your right to vote.\n\n* We care more about this than about your ability to breathe the air and drink the water.\n\n* We are willing to endanger all of it, **and all of you**, because otherwise Twitter pharisees will call us names.\n\nAnd worst of all, it says...\n\n* We think women are stupid enough to think this helps them, when all intelligent people can see this empowers those who see **The Handmaid's Tale as inspirational fiction.**\n\nThe stench of our weakness is thick in these developments, and Republicans smell it like a gourmet meal on its way.  \n\nGet this straight and get it good, because there is no question:\n\n* Not a single Republican will resign because of this example.  \n\n* Not a single Republican will lose election because of it.

Republican Senatorial candidate, then the outcome of the result might change by tonight's closing session. \n\nThe Evangelicals who provide a chunky size of voters among the religiously oriented voter turnout might turn the result in Roy Moore's favor by just showing up in all the polling booths. \n\nThe help that Judge Moore got from Trump in the form of his rally last week in Pensacola, Florida which is on the same media market as the state of Alabama is, beside the constant robocalls in the voice of Trump that the Moore campaign is playing round the clock in almost all the Alabama residents' homes, might help him in his race against Mr. Jones .\n\nBut the so called \"terrorist attack' by a poor resident from one of the poorest countries of the world called Bangladesh might turn off lot of voters against Judge Moore if they start believing the so called 'Fake News' that is circulating in the social media that Trump paid a huge amount money to the young boy's family to stage a fake terrorist attack to make Mr. Moore win by showing that a Senator Moore will be tough on terrorism compared to Mr. Jones. \n\nThe readers of 'Reddit' might recall the feelings of the french people when they ignored the terrorist attack in Paris this year right before their presidential election.\n\nSince Mr. Trump started denouncing all the Muslims there in France and also in U.S. by blaming that particular attack which also killed a french policeman that night, on the 'radical Islamic-terrorism' even before the french investigators started their preliminary investigation, most of the french citizens voted for the formerly socialist and independent party's member Mr. Emmanuel Macron and chosen him as their new president against Ms. Marine Le Pen of a right wing political party called National Front whose opinions of White Nationalism is aligned with Trump's White Supremacist views.\n\nThe french citizens was rightfully determined that our illegitimate president Trump was behind the terrorist attack in France that night just 2 days before a major and heavily contested presidential election there by providing huge amounts of money to that particular poor Muslim citizen of France to 'stage the attack and then kill himself' so that nobody knows the truth behind who actually inspired him to start the attack on a busy road in the french capital.\n\nNo wonder the french people feel justified in thinking that Trump's support for Ms. Pen made a poor french Muslim to start killing innocent tourists and french citizens and policemen so that Ms. Pen who hated the Muslim people of France as much as Trump hates all the Muslims of U.S.A. as well as of the whole world, win.\n\nThe french citizens still believe that Trump was going to gain a lot with Ms. Pen's win by lumping all the Muslims together with all the terrorists whom he still calls 'Radical Islamic terrorists and that way ban the entry of the all the Muslims to U.S.A. just to please his White Nationalist supporters.\n\nHe still denounces all the Muslims after each and every terrorist attacks even if those attacks kill only one American or no American at all like the one yesterday in New York, compared to 58 American citizens killed by one of Trump's voters in Las Vegas recently.\n\nGo figure

defend them somewhere other than the Vatican.  While under the control of the offender, the Church would call these others \"Antipopes,\" but to much of the Christian world, they were simply The Pope.\n\nThis comes to mind when dealing with someone as singularly illegitimate as Donald Trump.  Why - I ask you, **WHY** - do we not simply recognize someone else as President of the United States on our own accord, and let the raving lunatic **Russian spy** fail on his own demerits among his ridiculous followers?\n\n* He does not have the consent of the governed.\n\n* He is a traitor.\n\n* He is a criminal in countless ways even beyond treason.\n\n* He is hated throughout the country and the world.\n\n* He does not do the job he claims to possess.\n\n* Someone else was chosen by Americans, and would have been practically a unanimous choice without an enemy foreign power's direct and war-like intervention.\n\nSo I ask you, **why do we call Donald Trump President**, when he is not?  Why do we not call President the person we chose as President - or barring that, someone else?\n\nCould anyone else possibly fail against such an opponent, in a measure of actual support, if Americans took responsibility to say who was and was not President, and acted accordingly?\n\nTrump is not President.  He is as close to President as Caligula's horse was to consul - a sick joke of a depraved Russian tyrant, nothing more.  \n\nSo I ask you, who is your President?  \n\nWe would win any such contest, without question.  You do not know what freedom is built on if you think otherwise, and are of no use to us.  \n\nI await the inundation of the bot\/troll army attached to demoralize us - but you will not defeat us no matter what you do, employees of Vladimir Putin.

The world has changed and it has been left behind. Yesterday\u2019s Republicans need to adjust to a new political reality: Women are now allowed to vote. Minorities and millennials, too. The Republican strategy of winning 148 percent of its shrinking base will no longer cut it. In a connected world, the GOP needs to be the party that is going to open up the future for all Americans, an outsider\u2019s party that supports natural, organic economic growth, not old, top-down, political and artificial solutions from Washington. Somewhere, there is a Republican Party of the future that fights for a strong and powerful nation and its values, open to and shared by all Americans, whether they take an Uber or drive a Ford F-150. I doubt we will find that GOP before we are wiped out in 2018.\n\nThe GOP's problem is far bigger than this. Since Reagan the GOP has had a problem with the truth (I exclude Nixon because senators from his party were willing to impeach him, and ultimately chose Country over Party). Decades of GOP politicians, spokespeople, party officials, strategists, and donors have built an internal understanding amongst themselves that it doesn't matter what the objective, fact-based truth is, because their supposed and self-appointed First-Amongst-Equals relationship with God, Jesus, and The American Way mattered more than anything those sissy (weak on military issues), queer-looking Democrats had to offer.\n\nNewt's *Contract with America* was in fact the beginning of the **Deep State Conspiracy** (think *Vince Foster*). With the election of Dubya, the Christian Fundamentalist-Evangelical voters had finally realized their thirty-year goal of landing a Born Again Christian in the Whitehouse. (Prior to the late 70's \/ early 80's, Christians were formally discouraged from being involved in politics.) Whatever legit critique George earned through his own ineptitude, or that of his policies, was in fact an attack on his Christian values--*their* Christian Values. These unjust and ungodly smears reinforced their own belief that Satan was out to destroy them, and prevent bringing the Love and Light of Jesus Christ to all His Children.\n\nRacism and bigotry have never left Conservative America--they are as American as amber waves of grain. The Democrats owned their share of racism by being the party of slavery from before the Civil War up through at least Truman (and certainly instances later. I'm not saying the Dems excised it completely). During the 60's and 70's, there was a tidal change as Democrats became the Progressives, and Republicans became Conservatives. While it's true that the GOP has been fostering hatred and fear amongst its voters for decades (60's-70's), they didn't invent it. Racists and bigots have always felt comfortable in America.\n\nQueue Obama. Conservatives and Republicans have never felt comfortable with minority citizens, foreign cultures, odd ways of dress, and the like. With generations of hatred ingrained in their culture, ancestry, backgrounds, and family heirlooms, it was too easy (with a little help from the internet, smartphones, and social media) to believe that \"some guy from Chicago\" was in fact a socialist, Kenyan-born-Muslim determined to wreck America, someday inviting his foreign friends to impose Sharia Law on everyone.\n\nThis narrative cannot also forget to include the Republican War on Education. Since Reagan, the GOP has been systematically siphoning off federal dollars meant to help states fund their local school systems, and area colleges. As tuition costs rose, state and federal appropriations didn't keep up. Whenever a recession would hit the national or regional economy, respective (all, or local) state education budgets would get cut. As the economy recovered, state legislators failed to replace previous subsidies to colleges and universities. Higher education institutes had no choice but to raise tuition costs for their students.\n\nWe must also remind ourselves of the myriad other problems which beset education: school segregation is just as bad now, and in some places, worse than in 1954; the eroding of Separation of Church and State has allowed local, and state school boards to become infected with religious zealots who exercise enormous control over what is and is not included in history books and curriculums; teacher salaries don't attract star power; civics is no longer taught, so the average citizen doesn't understand that it's their responsibility to safeguard democracy.\n\nCombine these problems (and others not mentioned), and the result is: The Trump Voter. A person who combines some, or all of the following quantities: racist; bigoted; homophobic; poorly educated in matters of the environment, civics, world history, science, literature, foreign cultures, *et al*; a believer in conspiracy theories; a religious zealot; gun crazy; phobic of the federal government and federal law enforcement officers; etc.; etc.\n\nMcConnell and Ryan were simply the latest scientists working the levers of control over the Frankensteinian monster created by their predecessors. Only now, the monster has broken loose, managing to cage the scientists in their own laboratory. The Monster has gone on to spawn their own weaponized creations in the guises of Moore, Bannon, *et al*.\n\nThere is simply no way for McConnell, Ryan, or their successors, to back down from their unenviable position. Any attempt at rational discourse (*i.e.* \"Let's elect a moderate\", or as it has been labeled this week \"candidate quality\") will only be met by rage from The Monster who will see any attempt at corralling their behavior as (further) justification that **The Conspiracy** has finally co-opted them too, and that they need to be severed from the group before spreading the disinformation \/ fake news.\n\nThe Republican Party is dead."},{"author":"Druidshift","created_utc":1513276264,"title":"Ok, So Net Neutrality has been voted on.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"yosoybillbrasky","created_utc":1513277142,"title":"FCC just now voted out Net Neutrality.

(very long post)","num_comments":8,"description":"There is a fantasy among decent people, that the bell curve of decency occurs like a fractal in every environment: That you will find humanitarian philosophers, mediocrities, crooks, and a few actual monsters in equal proportions wherever you look - whether on the board of a university, the members of an extremist political party, or the citizenry of an entire nation.\n\nIt's one of the rare cases of projection reflecting well on the projector: Decent people, all the more aware of their own imperfections, seeing equivalent moral struggles in others wherever they go.  But it is not reality - it is a defense mechanism that protects sensitive, moral human beings from falling into the abyss they would otherwise observe in others.  \n\nUnfortunately, history sometimes confronts humankind with inescapable dilemmas, and defending humanity becomes incompatible with pretending that the most basic fidelity to the truth or concern for life is distributed evenly across all associations.  **We are confronted by precisely that dilemma today**, and so I will tell you some things I do not want to say and you do not want to hear.\n\n**Meet Bob**.  He is a Republican.  Not one those *crazy* Republicans you find on the internet, most of whom are Russian trolls anyway; no, Bob typifies the everyday reality of the GOP voter.  If you saw him in a crowd, you probably would not notice him: He's white, but not some *rootin'-tootin'* redneck asshole.  Affluent, but doesn't go around dressed like Gordon Gekko.  Religious, but not in the creepy, cultish sense.  And he considers himself a patriot, but was coincidentally busy with other things when the war (any war) he supported was going on.\n\nBob has all the superficial attributes that someone like Bob would consider definitive of a \"normal\" life: Wife, kids, car, job, house, church.  And if you looked at a slice of his life out of context, you might concede that he is \"normal,\" and take it as an excuse to fall back on the delusion described earlier - that Bob is like you apart from differing with your opinions.  But the closer you look, the more disturbing the impression becomes.\n\n---\n\nFor instance, Bob loves his wife.  Not his *actual* wife, of course - not the human being he married.  No, he loves the way he looks in photographs standing next to her.  He loves the envy he sees on the faces of other men, but not in the way that you might - not with a sense of being lucky and grateful.  No, the envy he sees is what he is *owed*, because Bob, as surely everyone can see, is Awesome.  \n\nBob also loves his kids.  Not his *actual* kids, of course - because, you see, the actual human beings he spawned are, to him, annoying, disobedient, and ungrateful drains on the money he Worked Hard^TM to \"earn\" (more on that later), so he prefers to leave it to his wife to deal with them.  By sheer coincidence, the more they annoy him, the more ardent his religious beliefs about a wife's proper role in the family become.  \n\nBut they too make him look good in pictures, and occasionally one of them does something that makes him proud.  Not proud of *them*, of course - who the fuck are *they* but fragments of himself?  His pride is in himself for having created them, and of his own superb parenting.  Bob, remember, is Awesome.  \n\nSometimes, however, his children fail him and diminish the rightful recognition of his Awesomeness in the eyes of others, and then he is angry.  But, for a change, this emotion is *not* directed at himself - how could he be angry at someone so Awesome?  No, his anger and other negative emotions can only go in one direction - at others, because they have failed him.  Failed to serve their proper function in his life, as ornaments on his perfection.\n\nBob doesn't hit them when he's angry, though not from any deliberate restraint on his part - he's just minimally smart enough to know that in this day and age, those *damned Libruls* at Child Protective Services might \"blow it out of proportion\" if he did.  And in those moments, he is filled with a sense of injustice at their *interference* in his authority.\n\nAfter all, his own father had been a violent drunk, but where is Bob's compensation for all that suffering?  At very least he should be allowed to mitigate it by inflicting it on others, according to his own instincts.  But a CPS record would taint his Awesomeness, so he controls himself and adds it to The List of Reasons Bob Is A Victim (e.g., #45792 being that the Mercedes dealership made him wait 15 minutes for a test drive on August 3, 1997 - a date that lives in infamy in his memory).  \n\nEvery time his wife or his children betray Bob's Awesomeness, every moment his List grows - and it grows on a regular basis - Bob thinks back to his gun collection and hopes against hope that they will never push him too far and *make him* use it.\n\n---  \n\nBut this is not something you would suspect of Bob, any more than it was suspected of the countless Bobs before him who have acted on those impulses - people who, if you look into it, have a striking tendency to be active political conservatives.  And who knows, maybe Bob would never actually do it - far more Bobs just take off when their families become too much of a burden than do anything extreme.  So, to his neighbors and coworkers, and probably even his family, Bob is at worst a mildly selfish dick.\n\nThat said, Bob certainly loves his job.  Not the *actual* job, of course - not doing something creative and beneficial to society while building his own skills and talents.  You can keep all of that touchy-feely librul mumbo jumbo, as far as he's concerned.  No, what Bob loves is the opportunity to get more money than other people - and not to *do* anything in particular with it, mind you; but just because making more money than other people reminds him (and others) that Bob is Awesome.\n\nUnfortunately, those *damned Libruls* (every generation of Americans since the Teddy Roosevelt administration) take a piece out of his paycheck in taxes against his will, and this both diminishes the triumph of making so much money and is a grave insult to his Awesomeness.  Who do those people think they are?, Bob wonders angrily.  Just because millions of people chose them to lead in a free and fair election limited by laws that protect his rights, do they think they have some kind of *authority* to regulate the finances of He, the Great and Mighty Bob? \n\n---\n\nWhich brings us to the most important fact - **Bob loves his country.**  Oh, not the *actual* country - not the 320 million human beings that collectively comprise the United States of America.  He can't even handle relating honestly to a single human being at home, so how could he possibly hope to understand an abstraction that massive?  And not even the abstract ideals that America has historically represented - a notion like equality is outright blasphemy against the Church of Bob.\n\nNo, Bob loves *his* country.  Not yours, HIS.  You see, America belongs to him, just like his wife and children belong to him.  Not in the sense of \"belonging together\" - in the sense that they are inanimate objects whose sole value derives from their being under his control and adding to his ego.  And as with his family, America's value to him diminishes radically the less power he has over it.\n\nTo \"improve\" *his* country, Bob is eager to vote for any politician who addresses some of the more painful items on The List of Reasons Bob Is A Victim, and having to pay taxes like a mere mortal in a republic of equals is near the top.  Bob has no theory for what the ideal tax rate should be - numbers and all that other intellectual mumbo jumbo is for Libruls.  No, Bob just knows that *his* taxes are always too high, no matter what the rate, because the money benefits *other people* in addition to himself.\n\n**Other people**...as if such a thing even exists!  Seen from the Bobiverse in which Bob lives, the money is basically disappearing down a black hole, annihilated.  Just as every dime he \"earns\" at his job wholesaling dangerous and defective baby furniture has been magically brought into being by the indomitable Will of Bob.  When something enters his awareness, it is He who created it; when it leaves his awareness, it no longer exists.  \n\nYou see, Bob's eyes and memory are omnipotent - they determine when a person or thing exists or ceases to exist.  Other people were once like Bob in this respect, when they were 3 or 4 years old, but they Lost The Faith (i.e., grew up) by starting to believe that other people than themselves exist.  So taxes were a disaster of epic proportions to him even before he learned where the money goes.\n\nOne day listening to the radio or watching Fox News, Bob is reminded for the millionth time that all tax money he pays is going to \"lazy minorities,\" programs to feed kids that aren't his property, and other things that are either anathema to the Bobiverse or simply not part of it (and thus completely irrelevant).\n\n---\n\nBob is not greedy, mind you - he doesn't care about money.  He just cares that whatever money he has is more than what *you* have, because otherwise his Awesomeness is offended.  And Bob is not a racist, mind you - he just thinks that if people who look different than him have the opportunity to achieve the same things he has, then his Awesomeness is diminished.  As any true believer in the Church of Bob would know, that can't be allowed.  \n\nSo it's very, *very* important - a moral imperative, in fact - that every last penny that comes into his possession remains under his own absolute control.  It's also crucial that people who are racially or culturally different from Bob know their place: Preferably somewhere he can't see them, and is never reminded of their existence unless he needs a handy scapegoat when his wife and kids aren't available for the role.\n\nBut don't get upset - it's nothing personal.  For it to be personal, he would have to see you as a person - and he doesn't.  You are merely an imperfection in the mirror that he considers every other living thing to be; a imperfect because you show him things that are not Bob.  Or worse, you show him things that are better than Bob, and such blasphemies - such atrocities against God - make The List of Reasons Bob Is A Victim expand very quickly.  \n\nRest assured though, none of this appears on Bob's face.  He is not a snarling right-wing lunatic - he just nods along to snarling right-wing lunatics, with the calm assurance that a decent human being would nod along to the sentiments expressed in the Declaration of Independence or the I Have A Dream speech.  His chaos and depravity are almost all internal, and only subtle whiffs of the decay and horror of Bob come out in the course of his daily life, in cavalier attitudes towards the well-being of others.\n\nSo when some snarling, right-wing lunatic running for public office promises to purge American society of minorities, crush the weak, start WW3, end democracy and Western civilization, and cut Bob's taxes, guess which one of those is the one he considers most relevant?  If another candidate promises all the same things but no tax cuts for Bob, guess who Bob will vote for?  \n\nSome of the lunatic politician's rhetoric is a bit much, Bob agrees - he prefers to keep things civil on the surface.  And he will concede if pressed that some of the lunatic's plans are not the most well-considered.  Bob doesn't want concentration camps or anything like that - he might be asked to pay for them, after all.  But you're missing the point - *the lunatic promised to cut Bob's taxes*.  **A lot**!  And he affirms the natural conclusion that people who look like Bob have more Awesomeness than people who don't.\n\nSo what's the big deal?  Bob is briefly confused by your outrage, until he decides you're probably just jealous of his Awesomeness.  What's the big deal if the raving lunatic formed an alliance with a Russian dictator against the United States - it was for a good cause: **Cutting Bob's taxes.**    \n\nWhy y'all so upset about the rights and lives of people who *ain't Bob* when Bob is on the verge of getting a tax cut?  \"Y'all are too self-absorbed,\" is probably something Bob would think, completely incapable of sensing irony.  \"Y'all need to spend more time thinking about how to do right by Bob, and less about your piddling non-Bob selves!\"\n\nSo then, because shit like this has happened before, and people like Bob have become the moral North Star of historical governments, horrors ensue.  It's not that he wanted those millions of people dead in that apocalyptic war \/ genocide \/ political purge, he just wanted all those non-Bobs to get out of his way (i.e., not tax him, require anything of him, hold him accountable in any way, or do anything that remotely inconveniences him).  So when he thinks about it, they kind of deserved it, didn't they?  Being all non-Bob, and yet still daring to impinge on both his awareness and his wallet.\n\n---\n\n**If you ask Bob**, old and decrepit in his taxpayer-funded nursing home decades later, about those days of horror his political behavior caused, he will say that he never saw it coming.  You can confront him with all the evidence to the contrary you like, he will not admit responsibility on any level.  \n\nHe will mouth sympathy for his victims if prodded, but will decline the invitation to attend the museums and memorials dedicated to the people whose existence meant nothing to him then and whose nonexistence means even less to him now.\n\nThat is Bob.  He is the smile and applause at public executions, the cheerful auctioneer at a slave sale, the flames engulfing buildings along with their sleeping residents so a developer can build condos.\n\nHe is your relative and your neighbor; he is your coworker or fellow enthusiast of whatever; he is the Republican voter.  He is the banality of evil incarnate.\n\n**And if you let him, he will write the future.**\n\nSweet dreams, America."},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1513385351,"title":"\"Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Murray (R), who is considering a run for governor, is accused by a former intern of wrestling her to the office floor and ejaculating on her stomach\"","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"sweetpoppi","created_utc":1513390488,"title":"Any elected Federal Democrat that votes \"Yea\" on the final Republican tax bill in either the House or the Senate will be targeted for removal from office by any means necessary.

The wealthy cannot create jobs in a vacuum. The laws of supply and demand drive job creation. You can't just increase supply and expect that demand will somehow materialize for your goods and services.\n\nBut the reverse is true. When you cause demand to go up, entrepreneurs will find ways to produce goods and services to meet the demand, creating jobs and gaining wealth in the process.\n\nSo to spur job creation you have to increase demand for goods and services.\n\nHow do you increase demand? Demand for goods and services go up when the poor and the middle-class have more money to spend. So to increase demand, cut taxes on the poor and middle-class and raise minimum wages. When demand goes up entrepreneurs will meet the demand by increasing supply, hiring more employees to produce more. This is what creates jobs, not tax cuts for the wealthy!\n\nHere's an example: Consider your local McDonalds franchise. If thanks to tax cuts for the wealthy, the franchisee has an extra $50K per year, is he going to make and sell extra Big Macs with that money? Of course not. The number of Big Macs he makes depends on how many people walks in the door of his restaurant. Given that he wasn't turning away any customers to begin with, he can't make more Big Macs unless more customers walk in the door. So the question is, how do you get more customers to walk in the door. The answer is, by giving tax cuts to the middle class and the poor. When they have more discretionary income they buy more Big Macs. Thus, the way to grow the economy is by giving tax cuts to the middle class and the poor, not the wealthy!\n"},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1513451769,"title":"Deficit Hawk Myth Dead as GOP Unite Over Morally & Economically Obscene Tax Bill - 'When Republicans propose deep cuts to Social Security, Medicare, & Medicaid for 'deficit reduction', we'll recall they raised the deficit by $1.5 trillion to give tax cuts to millionaires & big corporations.'","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1513452336,"title":"Hey Mainstream Environmentalists: If You\u2019re Not Embarrassed, You\u2019re Not Paying Attention","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"AngelaMotorman","created_utc":1513457827,"title":"How the Trump Resistance Went Pro in Alabama","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1513457975,"title":"Sen.

Can you guess what that question is?  That's right: **Are you fucking stupid or something?**\n\nYou do know what the word \"administration\" means, don't you?  It's not rocket science - the implication is right there in the word that it's a group of authorities who *administer* rules and laws.  Can you please point me in the direction of the rules and laws that Trump or any of his associates fucking *administer*?  \n\nAs far as I can see, the only things they administer or their own private interests, personal bigotries, and whims, which would make them *not* an administration at all.  There are, however, terms for such a collection of people wielding unchecked, illegitimate, and unhinged political power: **Regime** or **insurgency**.\n\nSo why the fuck are you saying \"administration\" when it's a regime?  Does it push your fear level past the red line to use language reflecting the reality of America's danger?  It damn well should, but you sure as hell should not respond to that fact by playing make-believe and comforting yourself with false rhetoric.\n\nIf you can't even use the *word* \"regime\" to describe a regime that's actively dismantling the country, you are the guy who is catatonic in the fox hole while his fellow soldiers get blown to bits.  Snap out of it or flee to Canada - those are your options.\n\n---\n\n* Corollary: Find new terms for institutions subverted by the Trump insurgency.\n\nThe failure to do this is more excusable, because it's much less obvious that an institution - e.g., the EPA - has been so subverted as to no longer perform its function or enforce the laws it's tasked with *administering*, it is no longer that institution at all.  And even less obvious why it's important to call it by something else when that happens.\n\nThere is no guidebook for such events, and we have no real leaders at the moment willing to provide one.  What should we call the Pseudo-EPA, the Pseudo-FCC, the Pseudo-White House, etc?  Merely adding \"pseudo\" is descriptive but weak.\n\nBut rather than working on something like this, our commentators just continue to call the institutions by the same names as always, as if the mummified corpse of a murder victim being puppeteered by its murderer in some horrific freak show should be addressed by the name of the person it used to be.  \n\n**They are failing to communicate the situation to the public,** as are we when we blindly legitimize the usurpation of those institutions by continuing to use their *former* names.\n\n---\n\n* Additional corollaries: Stop calling crimes \"policies,\" stop calling lies \"claims\" or \"opinions,\" and stop pretending that fully cognizant treason is mere incompetence. \n\n---\n\n* Ask your political representatives and journalists you read why they aren't following this advice - why, in fact, they are not the ones perpetuating it.\n\nI would specifically ask our political leaders this question (I promise it's a different question): **What don't you understand about the concept of leadership?**  \n\nWhy are you leading from behind, being dragged kicking and screaming to acknowledge realities only when our enemies have already goosestepped over America's battered body?\n\nWhy are you not out in front of the rest of us, lighting the way?\n\n---\n\nNow some harder ones:\n\n* **Democrats need to send parallel delegations to other countries as an alternative to Trump's in order to *genuinely* represent American interests and values**.\n\nYou might remember the recent farce of Trump's daughter being sent to represent the regime at a global economic conference.  His daughter, who has zero qualifications or experience other than *being* his daughter.\n\nOther countries obviously knew it was a sad joke, but if nobody else is there  to represent Americans, and the Trump regime might offer them some lucrative deals if they were willing to collaborate, then the politics of the situation would favor working with the regime.\n\nBut now suppose the Democratic Party had the *minimal balls* required to send our own delegations to these conferences, as the real and legitimate representatives of this country.  It would be a delicate matter for other countries to talk to us...but they would find a way.  They would cover their bases, because our presence there would be a statement of strength.\n\nThrough such actions, we would build relationships that could be useful - crucial even - if and when the situation deteriorates further and NATO allies become decisive in isolating the Trump regime from anyone but its Russian masters.\n\n* **Democrats need to appoint parallel administrative positions.**\n\nSince an insurgent *regime* is in power, Democrats need to appoint an *administration* of our own.  It would not have immediate power, but as its positions and choices attract more and more authority and respect vs. the unhinged Nazi chaos of the Trump regime, de facto power would accrue.\n\nAt some point, the Trump regime would either have to begin imitating the Democratic *administration* to retain its power, or would have to start making increasingly ham-handed and tyrannical moves to suppress it, which would further drive people away from it and toward the Democratic parallel.\n\nWorst comes to worst, America would have a readimade, law-abiding set of leaders and professionals in place and ready to *administrate* should the Trump regime cross the Rubicon and start a civil war (which is now quite likely).  With that kind of immediate backing, plus the diplomatic relationships established from parallel diplomacy, means America could avoid considerable chaos.\n\n---\n\nSo, there it is.  Some of those are things each of us can do individually right this moment, some require our leaders to grow spines, but any of them would help.\n\n"},{"author":"ginger_bredman","created_utc":1513471630,"title":"Corker says he hasn't read tax bill after saying he'd vote for it: IB Times","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"ginger_bredman","created_utc":1513476362,"title":"Trump transition lawyer accuses Mueller of unlawfully obtaining emails","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1513480792,"title":"Trump\u2019s Legal Counsel Claims Robert Mueller \u2018Unlawfully\u2019 Received Transition Team Emails","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1513481508,"title":"Senator Bob Corker Didn\u2019t Read the GOP Tax Bill He\u2019s Voting For: \u2018I Never Saw the Text\u2019","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1513483171,"title":"The Trump Campaign Claims A Federal Office Illegally Turned Over Transition Emails To The Special Counsel: In an interview, a senior lawyer with GSA disputed assertions made by the Trump campaign about the agency's decision to turn over emails from the presidential transition to Mueller.","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"rieslingatkos","created_utc":1513484065,"title":"Why Democrats failed to tank tax reform","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1513486045,"title":"2018 will be the year of women","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Barryallen125115","created_utc":1513492102,"title":"\"FAME WHORE\" Tucker Carlson RIPS Feminist Lisa Bloom TO SHREDS","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"onefivee","created_utc":1513498012,"title":"Trump Has Made History!

I just spent a wonderful year in a rural part of the USA. I saw how people there would and should be the natural allies of the progressive Left in the cities. They welcome broken people into the community, they support each other and it looked like a great place to raise kids. \n\nHowever, just now I\u2019m remembering time I spent in Oregon in the early 1990s in Springfield - a stone\u2018s throw from Eugene. Eugene is a university town.. and a bastion of left wing ideas, whereas Springfield at that time had a lumber mill and the whole town reeked from the air pollution that thing emitted. There was a big controversy early in that decade about the \u2018spotted owl\u2019. They were closing down forests all over Oregon to logging because of the Endangered Species Act. Something occurred to me that year. I think the tradition of family farming and authentic small town values really stopped during the Dustbowl. Afterwards, the economy had to change and what really became important was resource extraction. So, my model became that these people in Springfield were actually immigrants who were working for awhile, making their money and then leaving. That\u2019s why they wouldn\u2019t care about the air pollution and wouldn\u2019t have thought about ways to broaden the wood based economy and solve the environmental problems. In fact, they may have liked the stinky air, because it deterred left wingers from moving into town.. and all the problems that might bring.\n\nIn Germany, I\u2018m noticing that all of the villages across Bavaria are really wealthy and they all have a clean little unobtrusive factory. People live very well here. It\u2019s the richest province of Germany. People in these towns have big attractive houses and high end furnishings and it\u2019s a stark contrast to the poverty in small town America in this second decade."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1513512205,"title":"Jared Kushner Just Got The Humiliation Of A Lifetime On Live TV.

Let's call this **inverse-scapegoating**.  \n\nThis latter sort of behavior describes totalitarian personality cults, fundamentalist religions, and...anti-abortionists.  In the case of the former, there is quite a bit of cognitive dissonance to overcome, because a leader is conspicuously human, as are the adherents and preachers of a religion.  But a fetus is tabula rasa - it can do nothing, and therefore it can do nothing to impinge its reality upon any fantasy projected on to it.\n\nThe fact that the moment a fetus literally *does* become a baby and is born is the moment anti-abortionists lose all interest in its well-being, says a lot for this hypothesis.  Because an *actual* baby, an actual human being can be annoying, and costs them something to care about it.  But to ritualize the inverse-scapegoating of fetuses, all they have to do is reject the freedom of pregnant women - to take the position that **someone else**  should be forced to carry it to term, costing them nothing.\n\nAnd as there are two sides to every coin, the inversely-scapegoated worship object must have its scapegoate in contrast, and that is obviously women.  Not even specifically women who abort, but just women in general - the very concept of their individuality and being apart from their instrumental utility as baby factories.  \n\nAnyway, hopefully this thought process helps others with abortion-related arguments.

Paul Ryan is not going to gavel into order charges against Trump. \n2. If, for some reason, he did, any member of the House (read: Freedom Caucus) could call for a, \"motion to vacate the chair\", which would instantly call a new election for Speaker. The FC could call this motion to the floor everyday.\n3. Paul Ryan's days are already numbered. He is planning on an early retirement a short while after election day 2018. He didn't even want the job as Speaker, but Boehner convinced him to take it. He misses his family, and he is tired of \"herding cats\" to get votes. He doesn't want to run a re-election campaign wherein he would have to defend Trump to beat back a primary challenger, and then again to win the general. Whoever replaces him will be more conservative than he, just as he was more conservative than Boehner.\n4. As a borderline lame duck Speaker, his power is already limited. There are two factions within the House GOP that are vying to be his replacement, and they both have itchy trigger fingers.\n5. An impeachment trial could easily last months, or even all the way till the November elections. Not how Ryan wants to end his tenure.\n6. As long as the Republican party continues to deny that anything illegal happened between Trump and Russia, or that anyone in the administration tried to obstruct justice, or otherwise commit any other illegal acts, GOP members--and voters--can maintain plausible deniability, and insist that the Democrats, the media, and The Mainstream are on a partisan witch hunt.\n7. It's guilt by association. Everyday, Americans will read, hear, and watch about all the corruption that The Donald surrounded himself with. Any voter on the fence about supporting the GOP is going to fall on the Democratic lawn. Aside from the Forever Trump crowd, who wants to support the party that's being impeached? Trump IS the GOP. Moderates, Obama-Trump supporters, even some of his base will peel off.\n8. As soon as a trial of the President, his administration, and the Republican Party begins, the world will go ABSOLUTELY FUCKING BANANAS. The world media would be unable to talk about anything else, world markets will boil like a cauldron. Putin might even start some shit, like annexing more parts of Ukraine.\n9. Nothing else of significance is getting done by the Congress while an impeachment process is underway. No Transportation Bill, or any of the other important bills that the GOP wants to ignore, or spin up for the wealthiest 10%.\n10. Voters would want to blame someone in a big way come November 6, 2018. And the GOP would could lose in a landslide. Thirty-six governorships are up for grabs, and whoever holds the state executive seat, finalizes the maps for redistricting in 2020.\n11. Consider what happens if Trump fires Mueller, and the House Committees wrap up their own investigations into Russian Election Fixing. It all goes away. Democrats make a fuss, some of us are even going to take to the streets, where city police forces might try to crush us since Trump and his goons might see it as \"an insurrection\", but it'll die down eventually because people have to get back to work--bills gotta get paid.\n\nThe Senate\n\n1. Conviction in the Senate happens with a 2\/3 supermajority, or 67 senators, if all seats are filled. I have seen a lot of posts where people think it is a simple 60 votes. This is appalling, because a) these posters could have looked it up on Wikipedia, and b) they should have learned it back in History \/ Civics class.\n2. The Democrats have 49 seats, so someone list for me the 18 GOP Senators who are going to flip on their party and vote to impeach. This assumes that the Democrats vote unanimously, and someone like Manchin (D-WV) doesn't hold out. (Even if the Democrats win all 8 Senate seats currently held by the Republicans in the 2018 election, that's still 10 shy of 67, so Impeachment in 2018 doesn't seem likely either. While Schumer might take the Senate back, do you really think his party can make a clean sweep?--which doesn't solve the problem of how to convict, only makes it half as hard.)\n3. There's no point in the Speaker of the House holding a trial if the Senate can't convict, otherwise it was all for naught on the Speaker's part. The one exception would be if the Speaker truly believes that there is some sort of Constitutional crisis afoot, and they want their name as being recorded on what they believe to to be the \"right side of history\". We all know Paul Ryan has no ability, or interest in standing up against Trump, and his Welfare Relief Fund for Billionaires shows what he thinks of his name in the history books.\n4. The threat of Bannon & his rabid, diseased-minded supporters to primary any House or Senate member who goes along with Impeachment, has got to unnerve some people who in some other timeline [what's all this \"timeline\" talk about on these boards? Serious question] might have voted to impeach. I haven't seen any evidence that any member of the GOP is able to put Country over Party; why would anyone think they would put Country over Paycheck? Working for Congress is a good job, it pays 174k a year, plus benefits, and a [retirement](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Congressional_pension) which only gets better with the more time served.\n5. If Putin interfered in the 2016 election, why wouldn't he interfere somehow in the impeachment process? Buying off members of congress, threatening them with *kompromat* that's already in the bag, or ensnaring them in new self-scandals. How about declaring war on some other country--I bet that might interrupt impeachment.\n\nImpeachment isn't happening in 2018, and it might not even happen in 2019, or 2020.\n\nThe only bulwark against tyranny is US. All ya'll fuckers (I say that nicely) better get out and vote, and bring along two or ten other people who weren't \"going to make time for it.\""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1513682018,"title":"Ted Cruz Just Escalated His Public Feud With Luke Skywalker And Immediately Paid For It","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"randomaccessvagaries","created_utc":1513687551,"title":"Democrats in New York Can Already Hear Iowa\u2019s Siren Song","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"ihatejoemcCarthy","created_utc":1513689935,"title":"A real sick puppy Bob Corker proved that he has no character just like other Republicans who were promised of pocketing big money by Trump who's flashing millions of dollars in cash in front of those reluctant Republicans to get their votes on the tax bill.","num_comments":2,"description":"Bob Corker who'd shown some strong bones in his body earlier by feuding openly with Trump, has now reduced himself to a mere 4'11\" skinny lad with a hollow soul by asking his fellow Republicans in a conference committee negotiations that he'd not sign their tax bill if he didn't get a \"20% deductions on income he earns along with real estate moguls like Trump and his friends in the real estate business through limited liability companies,partnerships and other so called pass-through entities that do not pay the corporate tax\" as the article in today's NYT says.\n\nThe sick puppy and a real sell-out \"Mr. Corker who owns a real estate partnership in Tennessee, say the new loophole was not put for him.....\" as per the same article, is lying through his teeth because he knew his friends in the committee needed his vote badly and could never afford to lose his vote since John McCain is recovering in a hospital after his recent cancer surgery.\n\nIt should be mentioned here that Mitch McConnell and others in the committee did oblige him by \"airdropping\" the provision  immediately to please him and their president Trump so that they can go through the voting process this week .\n\nAnd Trump who always lies about everything is lying through his teeth again saying,\"this tax bill would cost me a fortune and my accountants are going crazy\" as per the same article, is spreading this \"fake news' again and again just like what he did to win his election.\n\nIf the Democrats in the congress want to stop this very dangerous bill that'll hurt the middle-class Americans in 2025 with a 39% tax hike again, they should mobilize at least a million democratic supporters in Washington and stop the Republicans from even entering the Capitol this week to vote on this horrible horrible bill that'll hurt the middle-class later on and help Trump and a very stupid Bob corker and 0.1% of Americans who're rich enough to pay $206,000 in taxes every year."},{"author":"chris_s9181","created_utc":1513690737,"title":"dear democrats SHUT THE GOVERMENT DOWN!","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"CharlieDarwin2","created_utc":1513692045,"title":"Public opposition to tax bill grows as vote approaches - \"President Donald Trump, the bill's salesperson-in-chief, lands at an overall 35% approval rating in this poll, his worst mark yet in CNN polling by one point.\"","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1513694657,"title":"Will Passing The Tax Bill Help The GOP In 2018?

On the other hand many of Trump's supporters knew exactly why they liked him over Clinton or the other Republicans. \nWhen Trump became President, a lot of people were willing to give him a chance to prove the media and his criticisers wrong, and his election only seemed like a nightmare scenario to the most balls out, far left liberals.\nHere we are now.

Even Dick Nixon who resigned in disgrace in 1974 proved to be a better White man than this White poodle.","num_comments":2,"description":"Right now the entire non-Whites of this country and also the whole world know how disgraceful a White man can be like our White president called Trump is.\n\nPretty soon all of us who visit the foreign countries quite often will be subjected to total harassment and ridicule only because of the horrible image that Trump is spreading all over the world.\n\nYes Trump, in less than 11 months in the office has done more damage to the image of the White race than any other White presidents of this country.\n\nNot even his favorite president Andrew Jackson who to all the native Americans of our country was a complete asshole after what he did to their ancestors when he ordered for the killing of all the Indian men. \n\nAnd his order to kick out all the Indian women and their children from their burning homes set on fire up by the White citizens under his presidency was another sad chapter of our otherwise a great country .\n\nThat's why to me and many other citizens of this country, Trump has a very sinister plan like his favorite president Mr. Jackson, that is to expel all the non-White citizens and residents of this country after killing their men.\n\nHe also wants to expel all the non-White women and their children from their burning homes to be set on fire by his 'White Nationalist' or 'White Supremacist' buddies.\n\nI see no other reason of his fascination with the most marauding president called Andrew Jackson whose portrait in the White House was right behind Trump recently when he tried to show gratitude to two leaders of the Indian tribes.\n\nHe failed miserably right after the ceremony by calling Senator Elizabeth Warren a 'Pocahontas' right in front these people whose land our settlers stole more than 400 years back.\n\nTrump's firing of Mr. Comey this year and his tongue lashing at the entire F.B.I. under the replacement Director Mr.Gray, shows to the non-Whites that the entire White race is made of fools like our current president, which is not true at all. \n\nEven Richard Nixon who fell from the grace by accepting his resignation as was suggested to him by the senior Republican members of congress in 1974, didn't make all the White citizens of this country look real crook as he was.\n\nThough Nixon did the most horrible thing when he first ordered the bugging of the phones at the Watergate Hotel room of the D.N.C. headquarters and also at the campaign room of his Democratic opponent George McGovern, he didn't go to the same treasonous level like Trump did by colluding with the Russians to win his election last year.\n\nBy sitting in the White House while making totally silly comments verbally and through his Twitter accounts, the image that Trump is projecting to the Black and other minority folks of this country and also to the billions of people world wide, shows the image of a prominent White man who's nothing but a buffoon at times.\n\nAnd a total criminal and a traitor who sold this great independent and sovereign nation's integrity by accepting the help of the Russian embassy operatives starting with their ambassador to U.S. Mr. Kislyak who as we know now had a direct phone link to their president, Mr. Putin which Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in most probability used it to talk with Putin and other Russian intelligence officials .\n\nHow do we know all about Trump's son-in-law's secret talks with the Russians ?\n\nBecause F.B.I. under it's then Director Mr. Comey used a bug on the Russian Embassy's phone lines, which is a common practice, used even now.\n\nBut Trump as we all know now, is denying the fact till this day that he did a terrible thing called 'colluding' with the Russians to win his election.\n\nWhat he's not realizing that his main 'go between' man with the Russian counter-intelligence office members, Mike Flynn, whom he kept as the National Security Director for more than 18 days knowing fully well what he had done, has flipped side because of a three year jail term the special counsel Mr. Mueller. has threatened him with.\n\nSo it's a matter of time before one more of our White presidents called Trump, who harassed our last president Obama for seven years by calling him a non-citizen only because he was Black, is going to resign just like what another White president called Nixon did for colluding with the criminals to win his second election in 1972.\n\nHope all the White citizens of our country will rise up right now against him and force him to resign peacefully before the end of the year instead of going through another impeachment trial like what we all went through when the House under the Republican control impeached Bill Clinton after the congressional election in '88."},{"author":"HondaAnnaconda","created_utc":1514043559,"title":"I like presidents who win their election

Amidst what could be the greatest political rush toward freedom since 1933, the Anheuser-Busch company has released its  apparently \"secret  formula\" for amber ale that the company claims it kept alive from before Prohibition.  According to [Ad Age](http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/cmo-strategy\/budweiser-s-marketing-push-includes-a-pre-prohibition-brew\/310981\/):\n\n>Anheuser-Busch InBev is reaching back nearly 100 years in hopes of giving its struggling Budweiser brand a boost. A limited-edition brew called 1933 Repeal Reserve Amber Lager hits shelves today, claiming inspiration from a recipe used before Prohibition began in 1920.\n\nIf this helps us recall the end of prohibition, it will not at all be the first time the company has honored FDR.  In fact, its long standing trademark  the Clydesdales came about to honor FDR.\n\n> Franklin Roosevelt (top Democrat and #2 overall after Abraham Lincoln) won office \u2013 in part \u2013 by promising repeal of Prohibition. When it finally happened, Budweiser hired a team of Clydesdale horses to send a wagon of free beer to the White House. This led to a marketing campaign that Budweiser still uses 83 years later.\n\nIn an age of super hero movies, It strikes me what the Democrats \"superpower\" is.  It isn't beer or marijuana itself, but liberty. That Democrats  *do* win both when the United States recognizes and expands freedom as well as when we recognize the inherent goodness of people.\n\nAnd that as the US Constitution states, we form government for our benefit, to '*secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity*'   to not be defeated by the cynical, and hateful, that Mr. Trump supports.

And why?  Well, because his **hate-filled rants** and **terrorism incitement** generate a massively lucrative amount of traffic for them.  They aren't very well going to sacrifice that money to some other company, are they?\n\nBut okay, we can live with that, right?  We shouldn't have to, but we can.  Twitter is owned and operated by corrupt fucks who exempt brazen, hatemongering criminals from their rules in order to share in the proceeds of their crimes.  So what?\n\nWell, time doesn't stop, and what just happened is **only the beginning**.  Other social media platforms will face similar dilemmas, and will overwhelmingly make the same choices.  All over the internet, Donald Trump and high-ranking members of his Reich will not be subject to the rules of the sites they frequent.  And it will only get worse from there.\n\nOnce they can say whatever they want without consequences while the people they attack cannot, then those companies will want to protect their \"investment\" by increasingly shameless methods.  \n\nWhat if Glorious Leader threatens to leave Twitter because the users are being so *mean* to him?  Well then, I guess we'll just have to interpret our rules against harassment (that apply only to mere mortals) ever more broadly, and start throwing out some of his critics to keep the gravy train flowing.\n\nIt's easy to see where things go from there.  Soon you have a raving lunatic openly posting calls for violence against his enemies while people who say \"Uh, no, that would probably be bad\" are thrown out as *trolls* engaging in *hate speech*.  \n\nIf they will change their most basic policies into an Orwellian joke to keep a hatemongering troll on their site, they will throw out a few users if he threatens to leave because they're \"being mean\" to him.  Then a few more.  Than a steady stream.  Users will learn that there's a Line they may not cross in addressing Glorious Leader, and that line will always be advancing on them.\n\nWhat Wall Street-owned corporation would pass up on the chance to become the official voice of a totalitarian dictatorship?  Answer: Not Twitter Inc.\n\nOh, and in case you've forgotten, by law the Executive branch can interrupt every communications medium with emergency messages if it issues the order to do so.  Nothing restricts what qualifies as an \"emergency\" - it's left up to the *learned discretion* and *responsible decision-making* of the leadership.\n\nSo *when*, not if, Twitter makes it an unofficial - or even official! - rule that you may not criticize or in any way \"disrespect\" his Divine Majesty; when you decide in response to stop visiting Twitter in protest; don't be shocked if your phone, Netflix stream, or even TV watching begins to be regularly and **forcibly interrupted** with the psychotic rants of a demented dictator.\n\nRants you will not be permitted to talk back to."},{"author":"rieslingatkos","created_utc":1514619614,"title":"DNC Attempt To Block Voters From Populist Left Contenders","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"bobthetapeworm","created_utc":1514623841,"title":"\"Donny\" - Todd Maternowski for U.S. Congress Kickoff Video (TX-32)","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieDarwin2","created_utc":1514637284,"title":"Angry voters can be high-information voters - \"Simply put, 2018 is on track to be the \u201cYear of the Angry White College Graduate.\u201d I\u2019d estimate the college-educated share of the electorate will be around 43 or 44 percent next year, up from 39 percent in 2016.\"","num_comments":22,"description":""},{"author":"anutensil","created_utc":1514647870,"title":"Charities see rush of donations ahead of GOP tax plan change - Charitable giving is expected to go down overall because of the tax bill.","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"ihatejoemcCarthy","created_utc":1514649822,"title":"It's not too late for the Republicans to declare Trump a 'nut case' for being overtly 'narcissist' and confine him in a 'psych-ward' in a hospital and put someone else in the White House.There will be no better time to pass the 25th Amendment to the Constitution than right before this year ends.","num_comments":3,"description":"If every Americans start believing the fact that 'narcissism' is a terrible disease and the narcissists are really sick patients who require not only counseling by some shrinks but should be institutionalized too, then Trump will spend most of his time in a nut house. \n\nAnd definitely not in the White House.\n\nBut as we all know that Trump is still sitting in the Oval Room after 11 months even after we all thought he couldn't win such a tough election with his cut-loose mouth which knows no difference between either decency or vulgarity, the time is ripe for his confinement to either a psychiatric ward in a major hospital or a full functioning \"cuckoo's nest' just like from Jack Nicholson's movie with the similar name.\n\nYes, the time should not be a factor for our Republican lawmakers to pass the 25th Amendment to the Constitution right before the year ends to put this biggest narcissist of our time into either of the two appropriate places I mentioned in this blog.\n\nReading all the stories in today's NYT of our great presidents like Roosevelt and Ike who wanted to shun the spotlight or their desires to be on the front pages of the morning newspapers or in the prime-time tv. slots, it is totally mind boggling to see Trump acting just the opposite of all the great presidents we had that the article in NYT mentioned.\n\nTrump, who was a showman before he entered the politics has become so hungry for seeing his name on the cover of our news magazines or on the flat screens of our television sets, that he'll say or do the wildest things ever or lie openly to the fullest extent that we as Americans will never do. \n\nTo call him just 'sick', is insulting the word.
