Many Democrats were opposed to the war and opposition seems to have grown overtime. Since Trump was an early critic of the War it seems that the Republican Party has now on the whole viewed the war as the wrong decision.\n\nIf you want to know why I support the war I will detail it for you here. By the time the Gulf War of 1990 was over Saddam Hussein had effectively suspended Iraq's sovereignty and made it an urgent issue of the international community against him by committing genocide, using WMDs, pursuing nuclear weapons, and repeatedly invading other countries. A violation of any of those is grounds for regime change and the continued violation of all of those justified and required the US and other countries to act against him in 1990. By 2003 he had continued to ignore the international community by attempting to build nuclear weapons and hiding them from international inspectors. He was also the most evil leader in the world and was unmatched in cruelty and ruthlessness. If you need an example of the wickedness that he engineered I recommend watching the video of the moment he sized power in 1979 where a forced confession against the Ba'ath Party was revealed infront of the party meeting where \"co-conspirators\" (perceived political threats to Hussein) were named and dragged out the room. After half the party members were dragged out of the room, the other half were given guns and told to execute the other half. This is the evil that had to be dealt with in Iraq and I am glad it was done away with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. It is my view that the Bush White House ran the war very poorly. I will not defend things like the lack of necessary troops and Abu Ghraib."},{"author":"AkiTendo","created_utc":1546456501,"title":"How many Republicans does Pelosi need to override Trump\u2019s veto?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1546457861,"title":"How Elizabeth Warren Could Win The 2020 Democratic Primary","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1546459303,"title":"Get Real About Romney","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"kitkid","created_utc":1546459828,"title":"What Will Democrats Do With Their New Power?","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"psychothumbs","created_utc":1546460039,"title":"Nancy Pelosi Rams Austerity Provision Into House Rules Package Over Objections of Progressives","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1546460774,"title":"Democrats to ask for 10 years of presidential tax returns in new bill","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1546461284,"title":"How to see if Trump is serious about making a deal to re-open government","num_comments":5,"description":"Simply ask for ten years in tax returns in agreement for his wall.

I'm hoping to start an honest discussion.\n\nI'm a libertarian, and I fundamentally disagree with both the democrats and the republicans on most things, but I consider myself a reasonable person and when forced, will pick the lesser of two evils, which is usually the dems when it comes to political issues...sans one thing, gun control.\n\nThe 2nd Amendment states:\n\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, ***shall not be infringed***.\n\nFor me, that's very clear. That said, I understand some folks disagree and think we need gun control reform\/laws.\n\nMy question is simple - as democrats, are you aware how much you alienate the \"center\" or \"middle\" when gun control is put on the table?\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to troll or inflame, but am genuinely curious if the average democrat understands that there are many folks who might LOATH trump, like myself, and yet who feel like they will be FORCED to vote for him, because if they don't a democratic president might get elected who will support stuff like Feinstein's recent gun control legislation: https:\/\/www.feinstein.senate.gov\/public\/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=EFC76859-879D-4038-97DD-C577212ED17B\n\n\nI suppose what I'm trying to say is this: I hate Trump, and I want a a better option, but come 2020 I feel I'll have no choice but to either vote 3rd party or republican because the democrats won't leave guns alone. I believe the 2nd amendment gives all of us the right to own any\/all firearms that we feel are necessary to stand up against a tyrannical government, which is what the founders intended.\n"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1547144054,"title":"Are Trump Supporters Less Compassionate?

I like Bernie's progressive platform, and am glad to see the party begin using it. Many of the plethora of presidential candidates are beginning to use his rhetoric as well and I like the direction it's taking the party in the long run.  \nHowever, I also know that 2020 can not be another split primary cycle, as the party will probably not have time to unify and outdo the $68 million which Trump has already raised for re-election.  I know that there are plenty of candidates in the race, but I think that's actually a bad sign more than a good one. Just as in any other election, every dollar spent campaigning against other Democrats is a dollar not spent beating Donald Trump.  \nI'm also a Ghanaian American feminist who does not think that identity (race, sex, age) should play a factor in deciding.   \nAnd so, the discourse I hope to facilitate as a nervous POC voter is: should we work quickly to try to unify the party behind a front-running candidate?

Democrats must confront this possibility with open eyes.","num_comments":16,"description":"Forgive the length of this post, but it is a vital subject...\n\nAmong the information from the Cohen testimony, something with the greatest potential significance for American democracy has seemingly fallen through the cracks - or is being deliberately marginalized: Trump's former lawyer testified to Congress that, based on his familiarity with Trump, he fears the man will [refuse to leave power peacefully](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/02\/27\/michael-cohen-i-fear-trump-wont-give-up-the-white-house-if-he-loses-in-2020.html?__source=twitter|main).\n\nWe register voters.  We cast ballots.  We donate money.  We volunteer our time to ensure an orderly and legitimate democratic process.  This is what *we* do.  What Republicans increasingly do, on the other hand - as we saw in 2016, and last November in Georgia and North Carolina - is *whatever they please* to corrupt, defraud, and rig elections in their favor.  America for them is not a community to serve, but a **possession to steal.**\n\nThe fact that the man they put in the White House was rejected handily by the nation he claims to lead, and openly caters to the whims of America's most despicable foreign enemies, not only does not shame them - they consider it evidence of their superior \"will\" and \"initiative,\" to constantly defraud or just ignore elections, taking power because they feel entitled to it.\n\nSo when the former personal attorney of this man publicly tells Congress that he thinks Trump would simply refuse to leave power if we defeat him in 2020, we should all listen, discuss, and plan accordingly.  Not just because of Trump himself, but because the cancer of fascist insurgency has metastasized throughout the Republican Party.  In every state where they think they can get away with it, they increasingly *all* act like Donald Trump now.\n\n---\n\nGeorgia and Florida, for instance, are now being led by indisputably **unelected** GOP \"governors\", having taken power through blatant coups d'etat via suppression of lawful voting, meaning democracy has been virtually overthrown in two major US states.  The shenanigans in Wisconsin and Michigan, while less extreme, point to a GOP that no longer accepts even the underlying concept of a free and democratic America, and will not tolerate being rejected by voters.  \n\nSo, when Donald Trump is once again rejected by the United States of America - this time hopefuly with the backing of the electoral college as well as the actual vote, and however many court rulings to boot - and simply refuses to acknowledge it, we already have some idea of what happens next.  \n\nIt's very plausible that other incumbent Republicans who lost would take their cues from Trump and likewise refuse to leave power, invoking State Police forces or even the National Guard to their defense; Republican challengers who lost would refuse to concede; and legislative bodies strongly controlled by Republicans could simply refuse to seat Democrats, have kangaroo court judges rubber-stamp their illegal moves, and in the process impose literal one-party authoritarian rule in that jurisdiction.  \n\nIn other words, there is a clear and slippery path from where we are today to the explicit end of democracy across large swaths of the country.  The normalization of tyranny has unfolded with monotonous predictability over the past two years - for which our own leaders deserve considerable blame for their lethargic, unimaginative, and meek responses in the face of an **unprecedented Republican crimewave**.  \n\nEven after our hard-bought victories this past November, speaking from vindication and authority, our leaders have yet to meet the line Republicans can cross that would cause them to rise above the status quo and do more than what they always have.  So we must ask ourselves, in all realism, what the move is when we do all the things we're supposed to - register the voters, get out the vote, and elect more and better Democrats - and in response, Republicans simply say \"Nope\"...and their ~~sleeper cells~~ supporters in so many police departments and military branches back them.\n\n---\n\n*All* elections, in all of America, are endangered by the cancer that has turned Republicans from a party of merely obtuse curmudgeons generations ago into what they are now - the resurrected spirits of murderous nightmare states defeated by this country in war.  Many of them don't even bother to hide it, as they openly wave the flags of those countries beside the Stars and Stripes to ritually defile it.\n\nThere was a moment in early 20th century Europe that ultimately led to more horror and suffering, in a shorter frame of time, than the world had ever seen or has seen since.  A bald thug in a fake, self-awarded military uniform was arguing with some members of Italy's parliament.  They objected to his actions, saying they were illegal.  As the story goes, the MPs were expecting some sort of lame sophistry or rationalization for the man's crimes, but instead the bald thug simply laughed and said \"I don't care!\"  \n\nAfter that, he just did exactly as he pleased, effectively nullifying Italian democracy with that single declaration of indifference, and proceeded to steadily eradicate those who continued to object.  It set the tone for European history for the next several decades, and inspired (among others) a mustachioed corporal in Germany toward similar aspirations.\n\nWhen you tell someone their actions are illegal, and they simply laugh and dare you to stop them - that's when history has reached another point of decision like that.  And if the only response to their challenge is cowed silence or empty rhetorical criticism, the wrong decision has been made again.  \n\nWe as citizens need to be discussing this, we need our leaders discussing it, and we need to incorporate the danger into our thinking about how we organize from now on.  \n\nOur party must have real strategies for confronting rigged elections, beyond status quo measures that are themselves subject to simply being ignored by subverted institutions; confront the illegitimacy of unelected Republicans who have taken office by force and fraud; and Democrats must be the voices asserting the authority of Americans as a free people, not meekly begging criminals to stop stealing from us.\n\nWe must make clear at all times that democracy is not a request, freedom is not up for debate, and authority in this country is either given by consent of the governed **or is not held at all.** \n"},{"author":"Lifeisaquestion","created_utc":1551426610,"title":"Alexandria Ocasio Cortez","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"CleetusXD","created_utc":1551429673,"title":"Regarding the gun laws in America...

Encouraged, but not surprised that it would trigger such a response.  This is evidently **dangerous stuff** (lol).\n\n---\n\nAn [article](https:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/online\/congressman-we-now-have-credible-evidence-trump-committed-very-serious-crimes\/) that's up right now has what is possibly *the* most infuriating sentence I've ever seen - all the more enraging for likely being an understatement:\n\n> While some of his Democratic House colleagues are reluctant to say that they believe there is evidence President Donald Trump has committed crimes, one Congressman from Connecticut has no qualms about going on the record.\n\nLet's have a momentary reality check here:\n\n* Donald Trump has been committing felonies **in public** for two-and-a-half years.  \n\n* Much of the time, he's on video or official social media channels either directly **committing** the crimes, or bragging about them.\n\n* The record of his crimes is vast, ever-growing, and **completely indisputable**, and has *never been otherwise* for even a single moment of his time in power.\n\nSo, unpacking the above quote, there are actually people in the House of Representatives going by the name of \"Democrats\" who, having witnessed the above up close and personally, are not merely reluctant to state the indisputable fact that Trump *has* committed crimes, but are reluctant to even acknowledge awareness of *evidence* in that direction.\n\nPresumably if Donald Trump walked up to these people and personally pissed in their faces like a Nazi version of R. Kelly, they would remark on the \"unexpected rain.\"  And while every groveling sycophant is entitled to their own cowardice when only their own interests and dignity are involved, the crimes Trump committed weren't against *them* - they were against the United States of America as an entire nation. \n\nSo, this shit is completely inexcusable: This kind of silence and equivocating this deep into the dystopian nightmare is **willing complicity**.  And what's more infuriating than anything is the apparent fact that it's the rule and not the exception in our federal leadership.  The Congressman cited in the article is described as some kind of fearless maverick for merely acknowledging *evidence* of crimes that are beyond dispute.\n\n**How utterly maddening must this be to Trump's victims?**  What kind of Looking Glass lunacy must this seem like to the families of people who have died due to his criminality and that of his accomplices?  To families shattered and destroyed at his orders?  To people whose children have been kidnapped by this regime?\n\nWho *are* these people that are afraid to *speak* the most basic and urgent of truths while drawing a public paycheck and portraying themselves as leaders of democratic resurgence?  Who are these invertebrates and chameleons still mentally stuck in another time, seeing a **Russian-backed fascist insurgency** as just another angle to score points off of in regularly-scheduled competition?\n\nWho tells them to carry Donald Trump's water at the expense of both party and country, and why do they obey?  The voters sure as hell haven't told them to pretend the sky isn't blue, water isn't wet, and that Trump isn't a criminal - the voters were tired of his shit by November of 2016, and made an even clearer point in 2018.  So just who in the hell are they listening to?\n\nAnd more importantly, why do they think telling the American people the truth about the national situation is an optional matter of political convenience rather than **the crux of their motherfucking jobs**, not to mention their basic obligations as citizens of a free republic?\n\n\n"},{"author":"dannylenwinn","created_utc":1551527919,"title":"Toomey promotes bipartisan bill to curb fentanyl imports","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"dannylenwinn","created_utc":1551529466,"title":"Dem lawmaker to introduce bill blaming Kim Jong Un for Otto Warmbier death","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"cattywampus08","created_utc":1551534614,"title":"Can anyone explain the significance of Cohen swearing he\u2019s never been to Prague but phone records that show his cellphone has?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"KubrickIsMyCopilot","created_utc":1551535717,"title":"Cohen: fears no \"peaceful transition\" if Trump loses in 2020","num_comments":127,"description":""},{"author":"data2dave","created_utc":1551537419,"title":"He Took Down the Elite at Davos.

We're fired up, we're determined, we're motivated, and most importantly we're going to work proactively to make sure Dear Leader loses in an epic landslide. To get there we're gonna donate, we're gonna canvas, we're gonna talk to our friends and family, and on that fateful day, we're gonna vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, there is that small percentage who are deeply emotionally invested on a single candidate, and they're being riled up into a frenzy by social media personalities, and some opinion news outlets. I'm not speaking of anyone in particular, just know that it's coming from many sides. I make this post today to ask everyone to please ignore them, and not just ignore them but when you see them make it a point to say \"***NO MATTER WHO THE NOMINEE IS, I STAND WITH THEM, AND I WILL VOTE FOR THEM.\"*** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese people will frantically find any and everything they can spin into a flaw and prove that every other candidate isn't as pure as their candidate. Sometimes they're even repeating right wing and Russian propaganda. We've all seen it in some degree or another in some place or another.   \n\n\nLet's all please just step back and look at these candidates objectively. We have a field of candidates that will vary from pretty far left to quite centrist, but the bottom line is no matter where your favorite candidate lands on that spectrum, we all stand for basically the same things, and even the moderate positions still demonstrate that someone supports the same cause as someone with a further left position. For instance, some candidates may want universal health care, which is great! Hopefully we'll get there some day. Others, however, may only support ACA fixes or extending Medicare. **This too is great!** Getting what we want is a process. Sometimes we'll be able to move in leaps and bounds. Other times we'll just be able to make baby steps, but overall, whether it's a leap or a baby step, it's still infinitely better than the alternative, which is 20-30 million people losing healthcare, and those with it lose many protections. Step 1 to building a house isn't \"build the house\", it's \"lay the foundation\", and we need to be ok with laying the foundation even if we wanted the entire house immediately. And that goes not just for healthcare, but really any issue. Again, the alternative is we get no house, and in fact, millions of other people's houses get burned down as a consequence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose social media personalities that I spoke of earlier don't want you to feel this way. They want you to demand one or the other, and if you don't get it, they want you to pout and protest, and stay home. **This election is too important**. \n\nWe're gonna have a fantastic, really passionate primary. We're gonna argue for one candidate or another, we're gonna be pissed at everyone not in our camps, and most of us will be disappointed, but at the end of the day, we're all on the same team. At the end of the day, all of our candidates believe in racial and gender equality, we believe in LGBT protections, we believe in common sense gun control, we affirm the fact of man made climate change, we believe in a living wage, affordable healthcare, real religious freedom, not just Evangelical Christian \"freedoms\" to oppress, and we believe in immigration. All of us and all of our candidates may fall on one end or the other of the spectrum of all of those topics, but we're on that spectrum, and that's what counts. By June 2020, one candidate will have won, and it'll be on all of us to celebrate the winner and champion them through Election Day on November 3rd 2020.   \n\n\n**WE** are the party that truly makes America great, and **WE** are the only ones who can \"Make America Great Again\", not this mafia crime boss and autocrat LARPing, kakistocratic, malignant narcissist, sociopath, and self professed serial sexual assaulter, philanderer, and 72 year old version of the Affluenza Teen. If you need more incentive, once Trump is out he loses the protection of the office. He will spend the rest of his life in a courtroom or in jail. Let's get us to that day. Let's make that a reality, and when we've won, let's see each other in DC on Inauguration Day and welcome back to the Oval office and position of the Presidency something we haven't seen since Obama left, which is a return to decency, grace, morality, ethics, and real strength, wisdom, and intelligence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**No one stays home. No one pouts. Ignore the forces of division and inter-party sectarianism. I believe in you all!** \n\n**Let's do this, fellas.**  \n"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1551571125,"title":"Why are progressives more focused on disagreeing with Trump than countering a dictator?","num_comments":17,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1551572838,"title":"Says President Donald Trump \"put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol.

His advice and observations regarding foreign affairs, the main focus of the book, we're really interesting to read and much of it was still applicable to this day. His thoughts on the lack of responsibility in the United States arms dealing and the potential danger for escalation of the Cold War rang especially interesting as we have our hindsight of the 50 years following the publication of his book. Additionally his observations regarding the US domination of Latin America was especially relevant nowadays with all the talk of potential conflict in Venezuela. I highly recommend any Democrats and, frankly, any American, to at the very least look more into Sen. McCarthy and his fascinating and insightful observations of US foreign policy, and, if possible, to find a copy of this excellent book."},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1551933319,"title":"Leaked Documents Show the U.S. Government Tracking Journalists and Immigration Advocates Through a Secret Database: The documents detail an intelligence-gathering effort by the U.S. and Mexican authorities, targeting more than 50 people including journalists, an attorney, and immigration advocates","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1551933728,"title":"Photos of GOP lawmakers wearing pearl necklaces at gun hearing go viral","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1551934013,"title":"#PresidentPete2020","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"cybersecp","created_utc":1551934519,"title":"Republican senator to seek Trump's tax returns if House Democrats do","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Elliot1210","created_utc":1551934925,"title":"What's the worst thing Trump has done in his presidency?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1551935012,"title":"Our elections are still vulnerable to Russian interference: More than two years after the 2016 election, the United States still does not have a comprehensive policy to counter and deter foreign interference in our elections.

We can all feel relieved when \"Ag gag\" laws which prevent whistle blowing on factory farms are successfully challenged in court. \n\nHowever, one needs to understand the plight of the family farmer and sympathize with those individuals. Otherwise, you get this big balkanization within US national policy making."},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1552370230,"title":"Democrats Must Reclaim the CENTER by Moving HARD LEFT","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"DakThatAssUp","created_utc":1552372353,"title":"Where is your Khaleesi now?

Share far and wide if you agree with the points made here, and feel free to outright plagiarize.)\n\n---\n\nThe media has continued its relentless campaign of normalization and rationalization in the wake of the New Zealand terrorist attack - the umpteenth Nazi murder spree worldwide since Putin's 2016 coup installed Donald Trump in power.  Some of the more obscene examples:  \n\n**White nationalists** is a term that's become ubiquitous.  On *this* planet, they're Nazis.  White supremacists, if you want to be descriptive.  These have been standard terms for them pretty much for all of living memory, but suddenly - around the time Putin's coup gave the Nazis power - this other term is everywhere, seemingly written in stone.  \n\nThe reason is plain: It's normalizing rhetoric.  There are all sorts of types of nationalists, and the word has \"nation\" in it, so it automatically has normalized or even positive connotations for many people.  See, calling mass-murdering terrorists \"white supremacists\"...**would be too negative**.  To call something what it is would be taking sides (aka objectivity; aka, journalism), and now that the Nazis have power again in the form of Republicans, suddenly they're supposed to be treated like a legitimate side.\n\n**Trump administration**.  *What* \"administration\"?  People who work for major media organizations are generally educated to a level that a sane person would call adequate, so they can see as plainly as anyone else that there is no \"administration.\"  There is no ordered group of professionals tasked with implementing laws.  It's a plain fact.  There are simply a bunch of criminal individuals doing whatever they please, or whatever Donald Trump pleases, without regard to laws, rules, or norms of any kind.  *Regime*, *insurgency*, or related terms are the correct usage.\n\nSo why do they keep saying \"administration\"?  Are they clinically delusional?  Again, it's just normalizing rhetoric.  Nothing to see here, folks!  The US Executive branch has *not* been overthrown by a Russian dictator!  The Constitution is totally still in effect!  See, it's just a bad *administration*, nothing worse than that.  Just like the Putin administration and the Kim Jong-Un administration, both of which the Trump \"administration\" adores.  \n\nYup, it's just a plain old *administration* that just happens to commit felonies with impunity on a daily basis, has privatized key functions of government under personal rule, and openly incites terrorist attacks by Nazis against the American people (and others worldwide), but other than that, totally an administration!  In the same way that sometimes people get a \"cold\" that requires treatments resulting in hair loss, vomiting, and death.\n\nAnd what are those things called that this ~~regime~~ \"administration\" supported by ~~Nazis~~ \"white nationalists\" does?  Why, **policies** of course!  Anything an *administration* does is by very nature a *policy* - it's nice, normal, and authoritative, like something that a totally-not-insane person came up with through an actual process of rational thought and discussion.  Calling them *crimes* by default would be too ~~objective~~ biased and even just saying *actions* would fail to lend the ~~regime~~ \"administration\" the legitimacy the media is determined to give it.\n\nSo, some people doing whatever they please, ignoring all laws and norms, and regularly contradicting themselves when it suits them - these acts are **policies**.  \n\nDoes this mean that every random meth-head who disembowels a cat in front of a group of horrified cafe patrons is also enacting a *policy*?  Of course not, because there's no power involved.  Power requires that legitimizing language be used to describe what is done, regardless of fact.  Now, if *Donald Trump* disemboweled a cat on TV and played around with its guts while screaming a rendition of \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\", *that* would be described by the media in the following way:\n\n**\"Trump administration's controversial animal rights position draws fire from critics\".**\n\nWhy are they doing this?  Are the media literally insane?  Nope, just utterly corrupt, cowardly, and nihilistic.  Quite simply, the news media business model is rooted in the construction and control of dichotomies, and when the truth is too plain to exploit, they simply can't use it - there's nothing left to say after the facts have been reported.  No yammering, no false equivalencies, no intellectual version of gladiatorial circus combat.  They would be reduced to half-hour news programs again rather than 24 hours of bullshit, and lose billions of dollars.  \n\nBut if they pretend that evil, crazy people are a \"side,\" that WW2 and the Holocaust never happened, that chaotic criminal insurgencies are administrations, that crimes are policies, and that lies are opinions, everything becomes monetizable.  At least until Glorious Leader shuts down the circus and just has wall-to-wall praise of himself at gunpoint, but by then everyone who matters will have moved their money and their families somewhere safe from the nightmare they helped midwife.\n\nWhich is not to say we are not to blame in any of this.  Normalizing rhetoric works because people want it, crave it - they choose it over reality.  Why?  Because reality demands agency.  It demands participation, and responsibility.  **\"Here are the facts.  Now the ball is in your court\"** makes people feel anxious, especially when the facts are *this* grim.  And not the entertaining kind of anxious that people enjoy, waiting to see what's next on a TV show - waiting for some proxy in Washington to make some bon mot at Trump's expense.\n\nThe reality that our civilization is under attack by Nazis AGAIN - you may be aware of the last time it happened, when 50 million people died - is not something people want to hear.  They didn't even want to hear it the *first* time, and a bunch of countries actually surrendered to it rather than face it - and, as galling as it is, plenty of Americans want to surrender as well.  They would rather hear their cancer diagnosis spoken of as a bad cold than really confront anything, and that's cowardly and infuriating.\n\nSo, folks, the questions to ask yourselves would be - are you a free, rational, responsible person?  Do you want the things you say to be true, based in the terms that respect reality?  Then these terms don't exist to you for foreseeable future in reference to current-day Republican politics:\n\n* White nationalist.\n\n* President \/ Presidency.\n\n* Administration.\n\n* Policy.\n\nThey're **Nazis** or **white supremacists**.  \n\nDonald Trump has no title in this country or any other but his own beshitted name, so don't go around robotically saying \"President Trump\" or \"the President\" as if that office even exists right now.  \n\nHe is, moreover, the figurehead (not even leader) of a **regime** or **insurgency** - there is no \"administration\" in this country above the state level.  \n\nAnd the things he and his accomplices do are **crimes**, or at most general, **acts** - there are no \"policies\" involved.\n\nUn-fuck your language and get back to planet Earth while we still have one, and tell the media to do the same.

To me, it seems like an albatross around our necks. Politics is not a playground or a dinner party, and there are real consequences to adhering to civility when others don't. When did we accept civility as some sort of requirement for discourse? Why have we never considered the fact that one person's civility is another's censorship, or the fact that civility is culturally bound and in the eye of the beholder? There are countries where governing bodies physically fight each other. Even the British house of commons has a long tradition of jeering and booing their opponents while they're speaking. \n\nFrom my perspective, Michelle Obama said 'when they go low we go high', everybody cheered, and we've been losing ever since. I suspect that if adhering to civility had not been imposed as a requirement on Clinton's campaign against Trump she would have won. The consequences of demanding civility are removing half the arrows from our candidate's quivers- are we willing to lose races in the name of civility? Because that's what's going on.

(No offense).\nI'm 30, and the median age had to be 60>. This worries me, as I live in a fairly Democratic area of Florida. Young people (less than 40(!)) Were about 15 strong out of the about 100+ people.\n\nMy God, it was boring AF. There was a nice speech by a local council woman, and the president of the county party was nice, but I don't think I learned anything. This meeting was touted as an update to what the Democrats are doing for our county and country, but substance was lacking. Most of the 'updates' were small details about other caucuses or the larger DEC meeting. This also worries me because this would drive out the younger voters. All of what was said in their updates could've been in a news letter. Im sure there were a lot of the older people interested in what was said, but most of the information passed had no action needed behind it. Also, the young Dems speaker was fast and efficient in his speech, but not everyone followed suit.\n\nThere is NO information for new candidates. This is something they're working on, but even on the internet, there is no one-stop-shop on what is needed to run for office, or all the requirements, etc.\n\nFinally, I'm not quite sure this Democratic party relates to the younger Dems. I think we have different priorities, different ethics, and see the world differently. I'm hoping more younger Dems come to change the party, but I definitely can see the older generation pushing back on major changes.\n\nI'm hopeful for 2020, and plan on running myself... But I see a lot of concerning issues in the Democratic party for my area of Florida.

Anyway, here are those strange, uj hi Jill 8 it 88\u00ed stories and sources for each of them.\n\n[Here's the article about a Trump server in the tiny town of Lititz, PA suspiciously communicating 95% of its internet traffic with Russia](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2018\/10\/15\/was-there-a-connection-between-a-russian-bank-and-the-trump-campaign\/amp)\n\n[Here's the article showing that Manafort gave sensitive polling data to Russian associates while head of Trump's 2016 campaign](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/08\/us\/politics\/manafort-trump-campaign-data-kilimnik.amp.html)\n\n[Here's a story about the secret meeting that Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater and Betsy Devos' brother, had with Russian officials and the Prince of Abu Dhabi in an attempt to setup a backchannel between Trump and Putin](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/seychelles-hotel-meeting-photos-trump-associate-erik-prince-met-russian-emirati-2018-3)\n\n[Here's the article detailing the meetings between Russian officials & a convicted Russian spy, Maria Butina, and NRA executives regarding Russia giving the NRA money to gain political favors, influence the GOP and help Republican candidates, incl Donald Trump in their elections](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/amp\/news\/timeline-of-russian-plot-to-infiltrate-nra-and-gop\/)\n\n[Here's the article about Jared Kushner and others having their security clearance denied because they were deemed a threat to national security by Republican career security experts and were overruled by Trump's appointee. This has happened only once in the 3yrs prior to Trump but 30 TIMES since Trump appointed Kline. 30 different times people were denied security clearance for being threats to national security and 30 times that was overruled](https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/amp\/ncna962221)\n\n[Here's the article about Trump's Russian business associate with ties to the Kremlin, Felix Sater, who went to prison for stabbing a man in the face and who wrote a letter to Michael Cohen during the campaign that said \"our boy Donald can get elected...and we can engineer it\"](https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/news\/nation\/2017\/08\/28\/our-boy-can-become-president-and-can-engineer-trump-ally-said-russia-deal\/PXje678sZBqmlP1MzJMHZJ\/story.html)\n\nYou can't deny that these are very strange incidents and coincidences that need explaining. If the Mueller report exonerates Trump then why is Mitch McConnell blocking Congress from seeing it when just 3 days ago he said they needed to be \"open and transparent\" about the report? If this is such great news for Trump then we should be able to see the full report and not rely on Barr's word, a man who's renowned for getting Republicans out of legal trouble and who said that the president can't commit obstruction because he's basically above the law. Just because there wasn't enough direct evidence to tie the Russian govt to Trump does not mean that Trump is exonerated.

We have the largest health care market in the world as well as the most expensive health care market in the world. It should also be noted that many IEDC countries have public options in a mixed market as well, universal health care shouldn't be confused with single payer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing on, I think there are some elements people should realize when discussing Medicare for all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. A lot of elderly people or people who are soon to be Medicare eligible don't like the idea of having paid into Medicare for their entire lives, just to see everyone jump on board. And this isn't just a selfish idea for them. There is also the idea that throwing everyone onto Medicare without any investment from the individuals could lead the program to insolvency, in reality, no program can be insolvent unless we allow it to be insolvent, but that isn't the argument that will be had in the public. \n2. A lot of people currently receive health care benefits through their employer. Nearly 60 percent of the population is covered under employer-sponsored insurance. That isn't to say 60 percent is happy with it, but let's say you get ESI at no additional cost to you, or maybe just deductibles. When you tell that person that they're going to lose their health care coverage and be forced into Medicare, they might vote against you. Their taxes are going to go up and there is no guarantee their wages go up.  \n3. Then you look at people who have government-based insurance, like Medicaid, tri-care e.t.c. These people may also vote against Medicare for all if their taxes go up to pay for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor all of us that want a single payer system, I think it behooves us to recognize the difficulties in selling that system in the current conditions. I think that a public option, allowing people to buy into Medicare as an option on the exchanges, still receiving subsidies when possible would be the way to go. It makes it affordable and guaranteed, it doesn't scare elders that we'll make Medicare insolvent, and it doesn't take anyone's health care away that doesn't want it. Does it increase taxes? Yes, but not nearly as much as fully covering everyone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the public option does a few things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. It will make it harder for private insurance to overcharge people as they will have to directly compete with Medicare prices.\n2. The more and more people who are on Medicare will make it easier to make a Medicare for All system. \n3. Easier to pass and doesn't exact as large a political cost on the party."},{"author":"Dulagar_Laochra","created_utc":1555034716,"title":"Why was Julian Assange staying at the Ecuadorian embassy and not in Russia like Snowden?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555036410,"title":"White House proposed releasing immigrant detainees in sanctuary cities, targeting political foes: White House officials have tried to pressure U.S. immigration authorities to release detainees onto the streets of \u201csanctuary cities\u201d to retaliate against President Trump\u2019s political adversaries.","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"worldgoes","created_utc":1555040366,"title":"only now are some people realizing there\u2019s a right-wing noise machine that targets Dems??","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555040941,"title":"After Barr\u2019s betrayal, DOJ and FBI employees must speak out: In \u201cgoing off the rails,\u201d as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) elegantly put it, Barr fed the right-wing conspiracy machine, misled Congress and defamed his own department.","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"dolphins3","created_utc":1555051103,"title":"Hillary Clinton: Julian Assange 'has to answer for what he has done'","num_comments":20,"description":""},{"author":"Meloncholicperson223","created_utc":1555053191,"title":"I have a question a big one.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Arriveria","created_utc":1555060513,"title":"Let's boycott products made in rural red states.

Instead, Democrats make hopeful optimistic ads, despite the research showing that conservatives only respond to appeals to fear.\n\nHere are some ads I would love to see...\n\nHi, I am the CEO of Monsanto. Under my leadership, we dumped toxic pesticides that are proven to cause brain cancer in children. Now the republicans and president Trump made me head of the FDA and I just made sure to make these pesticides legal to continue to be used.\nVote republican. Lets give more kids brain cancer together.\n\nHi I am a paranoid schizophrenic with a history of violence. I am convinced that aliens have invaded and are controlling most people I see daily, and I hear voices telling me to shoot them. Thanks to republicans, I can perfectly legally go to a gun show and buy a semiautomatic rifle that can shoot 36 people at a time without having to reload.  Thank you republicans for voting against universal background checks to make sure I can buy large magazine semiautomatic. Who wants to have to reload when they are mass murdering dozens of invaders at a time, right?\n\nYou can do that same ad with someone on the fbi\u2019s terrorist watch list. Republicans voted to make sure people on the no fly list due to suspected terrorism can still go out and buy guns.\n\nHi I run a for profit prison. The republicans in Texas just voted to put doctors and women that get an abortion in jail. Business is going to be booming. Thank you Republicans.\n\nNow those are the kinds of ads that will go viral, raise awareness and actually appeal to conservative fears. The final versions should be 100% accurate but also designed to go viral, and designed to out the entire Republican party on the defensive.\n\nThis article illustrates how conservatives successfully rally people to their side by appealing to irrational fears... https:\/\/soapboxie.com\/us-politics\/21-TruthsThat-Prove-Republicans-Have-Been-Wrong-About-Everything\n\nSo why don\u2019t democrats appeal to rational fears instead?\n\nI am fairly certain that political ads like the ones I posted above would be way more effective than the vanilla boring ads that democrats currently run. Ads like those I posted put republicans on the defense and force them to try to justify their nonsense ideas."},{"author":"dolphins3","created_utc":1555272182,"title":"Liberal think tank accuses Bernie Sanders of trying to 'muzzle' journalists","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"wingedcheese","created_utc":1555272712,"title":"Pete Buttigieg officially announces run for President!","num_comments":89,"description":""},{"author":"Landinium","created_utc":1555272949,"title":"Why don't we hold a reddit Primary debate?","num_comments":0,"description":"Okay so i've only been on reddit for like 5 months so I don't know what this place is like during election season as a result i'm not exactly sure if this is something that has been done before.

The reddit presences of each 2020 Dem candidate is very limited compared their IRL presences which can cause a very acute case of echo chamber to develop. To combat this I propose the following:  \n\n\n\\- Each **major candidate's largest subreddit nominates a designated person** to fill in for the candidate themselves i.e. r\/SandersForPresident, r\/bidenbro, r\/Kamala, r\/pete_buttigieg etc. nominate one person each.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **A debate is held in a third party place** (i.e. such as Discord), moderated by r\/democrats' moderating team or someone else neutral   \n\n\n\\- Questions can be croudsourced from both r\/democrats, places like r\/AskReddit, perhaps even r\/republican (if we're serious about cracking the echo chamber)  \n\n\n\\-Everyone is invited to observe and we **advertise the hell out of it, make it as big as possible**. That way not only are subreddits r\/Republican exposed to Democratic values, but subreddits like r\/pete_buttigieg are exposed to r\/SandersForPresident who are exposed to r\/bidenbro who are exposed to r\/kamala etc. etc. While this won't solve the echo chamber problem it'll help the situation on reddit! **IT WOULD ALSO BE REALLY FUN!**"},{"author":"jamalwhite70","created_utc":1555273211,"title":"\u2018Firefighter Prophet: \u2018Trump Will Go Down as Great Christian Leader","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Eisenheart","created_utc":1555273417,"title":"Unification.","num_comments":2,"description":"I think, and maybe this is just me here...

This time, with some Amnesia Haze and CNN, I started drafting up a potential list of Republicans that would vote against party lines *if evidence was sufficient to do so*.\n\n\\---\n\nThere are Currently **53** Republicans, **45** Democrats, and **2** Independents in Senate. We need **67** votes for a sitting president to be removed.\n\nAssuming all Democrats would vote party line along with Angus King and Bernie Sanders (the Independents), we would need **20** Republicans to side with Democrats for impeachment. \n\nUtilizing FiveThirtyEight\u2019s \u201cTracking Congress in the Age of Trump\u201d tool as well as some other basic knowledge, I set up this  list of Republicans that ***could*** ***potentially*** side with Democrats if proper evidence were to be presented based on how often they have sided with Trump during the current Congressional period. \n\nNOTE: This does not take into consideration if they are cowards (Ted Cruz) or how likely they are to fold like a wet napkin (Mitt Romney). \n\n\\--\n\n Now, based PURELY on voting records, here are 9 potential GOP senators that could vote for impeachment:\n\n1. Collins (30%)\n2. Murkowski (50%)\n3. Moran (60%)\n4. Alexander (66.7%) - Retiring \n5. Romney (70%)\n6. Cotton (70%)\n7. Rubio (70%)\n8. Daines (70%)\n9. Lee (70%)\n\nSome of those are obvious because they're outspoken against Trump (like Collins). We also have to look at Lamar Alexander (66.7%) who is retiring in 2020. He has started to move away from Trump lately and may consider voting for impeachment because he doesn't need to worry about re-election. \n\n\\---\n\nThere are also, obviously, a few others with higher \"Vote With Trump\" scores that still might speak out against him due to past behavior and comments, including:\n\n1. Gardner (77.8%) \u2014 Getting high, but he\u2019s a noted critic of Trump\n2. McSally (80%)\n3. Blunt (80%) - Voted against Trump a couple times and was booted out of GOP events so might be bitter.\n4. Sasse (80%) - Has publicly gone against Trump on a few things and is still young enough to maybe think properly. \n5. Toomey (80%) - Has repeatedly and publicly taken on Trump.\n6. Wicker (80%) - Has been occasionally critical of Trump, but not so much publicly\n7. Scott, Tim (88.9%) - Has taken on Trump a few times, mainly with race relations. \n8. Ernst (90%) - She turned down a VP offer back in the day, and has recently started to move away from him politically. \n\nThere are *also*  some weird outliers like Thom Tillis, who mostly has sided with Trump, has made a few strange moves including siding with Mueller and voting against Trump\u2019s border security emergency.\n\n\\---\n\nSo, looking above, even with *sufficient* evidence for impeachment, we could have about 17 GOP senators that would consider voting for impeachment if the time ever comes. That number is still not enough, but we also don't know what could be redacted that could pull us in a few more (arrogant-ass Rand Paul and dipshits Rick Scott\/Ted Cruz might step away from Trump again if he thinks his future is jeopardized by sticking around). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, for the TL;DR... there are about 17 GOP senators that have some reason to potentially vote against Trump and in favor of impeachment, based on my stoned calculations.\n\n  \nCheers,\n\n\\-A."},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555645285,"title":"Mueller\u2019s Damning Report: It lays out everything Congress needs to investigate the president for obstruction of justice.","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555646469,"title":"The Mueller report is saying the pee tape is real?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"jdooley99","created_utc":1555646553,"title":"I think I know where the Dems are going with this and it's smart","num_comments":8,"description":"I'm already hearing talks about putting new laws on the books to prevent future Presidential campaigns from cooperating with foreign entities to affect elections.

Other people were appointed to make decisions for her. Apparently she has been almost completely unable to file motions in her favor, pointing to a severe lack of safeguards of the rights of the person affected in the law. The decision to declare someone unfit should not rest with a judge but with a special panel, with hearings involving the affected every 6 months, and strong safeguards against abuse. The government having the ability to declare someone unfit are the seeds of a despotic totalitarian regime.*\n\nI have seen what happened to Britney Spears, having an aparent crisis and due to that, having taken her civil rights away, granting her father and a lawyer all the legal power to make all the decisions in her life. It is incredibly stunning that a legal system in America allows to do this with such little concern for the individual rights of the person and such little legal options by the person being stripped of their most basic civil rights.\n\nThis should really be of concern to people in America. When the government can make the decision to label you unfit to make your own decisions and strip you of your civil rights, that's the seeds of a despotic totalitarian state right there.\n\nBritney apparently can't even resort to much legal recourse she may want because she is under almost complete control and surveillance of the conservators, if I interpreted the news correctly. She can't go to court freely and file much of anything without having repercussions for her. Apparently she managed somehow to file something at court against her conservatorship and that is when things seems to have unraveled for her, the conservators probably taking swift action against her for her daring deed of trying to gain back her civil rights and life.\n\nThis legal system that allows this to happen is absolutely a disgrace, an abuse and a complete danger to freedom of citizens. Although there might be legitimate cases where conservatorships may happen, there should be very strong safeguards against abuse and to protect the freedom and civil rights of the person. In no case should a conservatorship be granted permanently. At least every six months there should be a hearing, affording the affected person the right to speak freely about their concerns, evidence, and wishes, and decisions should be made not by a judge but rather by a panel composed equally by random jurors, psychiatrists or psychologists, sociologists, philosophers, and civil rights lawyers, and the decision should be unanimous.\n\nTaking away the legal capacity of a person to make their own decisions is something that absolutely belongs in a despotic totalitarian regime and not in a free country without there being incredible strong safeguards to the rights and freedom of the person. #FREEBRITNEY !!!!"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555795224,"title":"Trump Says \u2018Game Over,\u2019 but Winter Is Coming: Congress now gets its bite of the apple, and the hidden secrets of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and his reign of misrule will continue to come into the light.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555797357,"title":"Noah Shachtman on Twitter: \"This is despicable. \"Julian Assange not only knew that a murdered DNC staffer wasn\u2019t his source for thousands of hacked party emails, he was in active contact with his real sources in Russia\u2019s military intelligence unit months after Seth Rich\u2019s death.\"\"","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"dolphins3","created_utc":1555798987,"title":"Hillary Clinton: To all who are celebrating, chag Pesach sameach!","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555800457,"title":"Russia attacked us.

I understand that this apology will never be forthcoming.\n\nWhat I would like to discuss is...why after the release of the Mueller report, are all of the Sanders subs still insisting that there was a grand conspiracy to kill Seth Rich?  Even though they are actively hurting a grieving family, and as far as I can tell, are not attracting any new supporters to Sanders by going on an on about Seth Rich.  r\/wayofthebern even has a sidebar link they added a few days ago insisting that Seth Rich was personally murdered by Hillary Clinton.  Not that this is limited to just that subreddit, every Bernie subreddit was banging the Seth Rich Drum for such a long time...and many still do to this day.\n\nSo I guess My question to Bernie Sanders supporters is...why are you so horrible?  Why would you use a young man's tragic murder as a plank in your \"vote for Bernie!\" platform?  What do you hope to gain by continually insisting it's true?\n\nI keep seeing a lot of Sanders supporters insisting that Bernie is being maligned by the media, that people are dismissing his supporters out of hand, that we original Democrats must take your thoughts and feelings into account if we ever want to win another election....but when I go to your subreddits to learn what your thoughts and feelings are I see about a thousand posts and sidebars saying Pizzagate is real, that Seth Rich was murdered by the DNC, not to mention the non-stop attacks on other candidates..not just attacks on their policies, but attacks on their gender, their sexuality, their race, etc.\n\nIt's hard to take you people seriously when this is the face you show to the world."},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1555951239,"title":"California Democrats are awash in cash as the next fight over control of Congress begins","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"ChristianFaherty","created_utc":1555952239,"title":"School Project Survey","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1555952794,"title":"Perry Farrell wrote a song about Rachel Maddow on new record, Kind Heaven, calls her his favorite journalist","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"ChristianFaherty","created_utc":1555953163,"title":"Tax Plan School Project Survey (Don't need to know about the subject at all)","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Ghdust2","created_utc":1555953666,"title":"After Democrats Surged In 2018, Republican-Run States Eye New Curbs On Voting.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555958701,"title":"The case for and against impeachment: The 2020 election or House Democrats' legacy could be on the line.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"cheweychewchew","created_utc":1555959151,"title":"Republican lawmaker sees less-redacted Mueller report","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Privacy_74","created_utc":1555959536,"title":"Lindsey Graham\u2019s Impeachment Hypocrisy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555959870,"title":"Sri Lanka attacks show how Trump\u2019s immigration policies hurt Christian minorities: Oppressed Christians from Sri Lanka are hard pressed to attain refugee status in the United States.","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"GaudierNine","created_utc":1555961891,"title":"I got banned from the r\/The_Donald For rule #2 America IS the world","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555962809,"title":"Trump Shares Video Demanding Criminal Charges for Officials Who Launched Russia Probe","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1555964083,"title":"No bottom: Republicans show they\u2019ll defend just about anything Trump does -- Republicans chose as their leader the single most loathsome figure in American public life, a man possessed of not a single human virtue.

I believe that the key to that is for it to become part of the state platform for as many states as possible. I\u2019m posting this here because I hope everyone that reads this votes in the primary, and I hope that if enough caucus goers can propose this to their state party platforms, it can become a major plank in the 2020 platform. The importance of this is twofold, it will five better representation in the electoral college, while also giving better representation in the House of Representatives. Repealing this law would need to be followed by a \u201cWyoming Rule\u201d, which would make the maximum population of a House District the same as the population for the smallest state, which at this point is Wyoming. I believe that a Democratic Congress and President after the 2020 census could easily pass such legislation."},{"author":"lamb2cosmicslaughter","created_utc":1556082064,"title":"For once they dont want to impose will over others....","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"lamb2cosmicslaughter","created_utc":1556082068,"title":"For once they dont want to impose will over others....","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"daskolin","created_utc":1556083181,"title":"Question: Why democrats in your country reek of K.K.K.?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"donkijote97","created_utc":1556083395,"title":"These are the results of the latest membership poll released by Democracy for American.

In light of these being hot topics and how these benefits would affect the general public,  I wanted to provide my experiences as to how these have enhanced my life and my opinion (for what it\u2019s worth) on how these benefits would add to society.\n \nI am 24 years old, born to a middle class family, and now married. For a bit of background\/disclaimer, these benefits are a result of my military service (I am no longer serving) so it\u2019s not like they were just given to me, but I believe the results are relatively the same. Because of service related disabilities, I receive full medical coverage from the VA that I do not pay a dime for (minus dental and vision). In addition to this medical coverage, I receive roughly $900 a month as disability payment. Finally while I was active duty, I earned my associates degree in Applied Science of Avionics and my bachelor\u2019s degree in Accounting for less than $5,000 out of my pocket (damn near free). After transitioning out of the military I got a government contracting job making $75,000 a year and after the government shutdown in January I took a government contracting job making $95,000 a year.\n \nThe reality is, my wife and I would be financially stable without all of these benefits. These benefits have allowed us to take risks that we would not have otherwise felt comfortable taking. I will start with my transition from the military to the civilian world. My last military pay check was October 1st 2018. For my wife to pursue her education goals, we decided to move to Washington, D.C. We moved here prior to either of us having a job lined up. Our financial stability was based on our savings account and the $900 a month income. We were able to comfortably wait two months for me to find a job and get my first pay check (we had the budget to go longer if necessary). This stability provided by my \u201cUniversal basic income\u201d and by graduating college with $0 debt allowed me the confidence to turn down less than ideal job offers and take my time deciding on the right career path.\n \nKnowing that my health is taken care of is also a huge weight lifted off our shoulders. I am a government contractor. During the government shutdown in January, I was temporarily laid off until the end of the shutdown. My contracting company would have required me to pay out of pocket for my insurance premium (if I had insurance through them). This would have added financial constraint to an already financially constraining situation. Because my healthcare was free, I never had to worry about the financial burden of getting sick and having doctor\u2019s office bills.\n \nWithout these benefits, I would have accepted my first job offer out of the military for a job I was not really interested in, making $60,000 just to pay the bills. I would have second thought every time I visited the doctor to determine if it was really worth it. Added to that would have been monstrous school loans because of my degree.\n \nThese benefits added much more to my life than what they are at face value. They have given me the stability to make sound career decisions and accept risks that ultimately enhanced my life. Free healthcare, UBI, and free college add benefits tenfold their original value. These benefits would not just provide a crutch for the lower income class, they are benefit the wellbeing of all Americans.\n \nI realize this is all anecdotal information since it is just my specific experience, but I believe everyone should have this same opportunity. My life without all of this would likely be vastly different. In my opinion, a thriving society would be the result of the investment into free healthcare, UBI, and free education.\n \nDisclaimer: I did my best to provide a brief rundown of everything. I\u2019m not the most eloquent writer, but I hope I was able to say something useful."},{"author":"sXehero137","created_utc":1556314842,"title":"Biden Launches 2020 Run With Lobbyist Cash","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"ClassyHusky11","created_utc":1556319569,"title":"Discord?","num_comments":1,"description":"Is there a democrat discord?

The largest country is Germany with 83 million people. That's compared to the US with 325 million.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese countries also tend to be far more homogeneous, have very different histories than ours, and very different cultures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's take a look at a few things. College in the US is VERY different from college in Western Europe. When people say that college should be free like Western Europe, they think they're making an apples to apples comparison, but it just isn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. College enrollment is much lower in European countries.\n2. Colleges in Western Europe don't tend to have dormitories or in some cases even full-fledged campuses, particularly in countries where college is free.\n3. Options tend to be fewer in these countries as well in regards to areas of study. They also in many cases do away with undeclared majors.\n4. Colleges in Europe tend to have much larger student to faculty ratios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilarly, with Health Care, I think (and maybe this is a straw man assumption) many people believe that health care is just free in most western european countries and that they just pay taxes to pay for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile it is true that most of the industrial world has universal health care, that comes in all shapes and sizes. Most countries don't actually have a single payer system and the ones that do tend to be the smaller countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it is important to recognize that universal health care doesn't just mean single payer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have\n\n1. Single Payer\n2. Beveridge Model Single Payer\n3. Universal Coverage, Public\/Private Mix\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it is important when discussing health care to acknowledge the differences and challenges with each system and then try to find a system that will work best for this country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCanada has a single payer system, but their population size of 37.06 is smaller than California. They also had to impose income caps on medical professionals and saw hospitals close and wait times increase for care. Canada does well in covering major illnesses but isn't so great with chronic illness. Any system of health care is going to have trade offs and disadvantages. If anyone tells you that there is a perfect solution to health care in the US by simply do Plan A or Plan B or copying Country A or Country B, they are lying to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are only two countries in the world with larger populations than the United States and neither has a health care system you would want the US to adopt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJapan is probably the largest country with a universal health care system worth looking at. It's a very interesting health care system, that I think many right now would say still isn't liberal enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone pays a health care tax and as a result the government pays for 70% of your health care costs, but you still have to pay for 30 percent. Note there are ceilings for what you have to pay for depending on how much you make, but if you look at Japan, they are also having a health care crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHealth care is like any other issue, we're going to debate this issue for as long as we're alive unless there is some magic pill or technology to fix what ails us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I would love for the country to have free health care and free college, but I think we need to recognize our legacy systems won't allow for that, and if we try to force a square peg into a circle, it's going to come at great cost to the desired outcome and politically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think we should focus more on transitioning into the systems we want to see and this is where I think people of good conscience disagree. I think Medicare for America is a better plan for right now than Medicare for All. I think free community college, debt-free public college, and refinancing outstanding student loans is more sensible, equitable, and plausible than free public college and student loan forgiveness for everyone who hasn't paid their student loans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nParticularly, at a time when we need to focus our economy on renewable energy and solving the problem of climate change, I think this is more than a case of chewing gum while walking. While we see our national debt rising dramatically, we should focus on reducing military expenditure and on jobs of the future and a sustainable climate, and not tax giveaways to the wealthy and corporations, but I think doubling down on expenditure now will sink us further into the deficit and debt. I know you may disagree, I'm not asking you to agree. I'm asking you to make your arguments with the full recognition that these systems other countries have are very different from our own and their circumstances are very different as well."},{"author":"andricp","created_utc":1556376471,"title":"Russian Hackers Were \u2018In a Position\u2019 to Alter Florida Voter Rolls, Rubio Confirms","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1556376534,"title":"Governor Mills Signs Legislation to Establish Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Privacy_74","created_utc":1556379479,"title":"Mnuchin Faces Prison Time For Not Releasing Trump\u2019s Tax Returns","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"cheweychewchew","created_utc":1556380835,"title":"Bill Maher hits Mueller after report: 'Prosecutor Jesus' didn't leave adequate road map for impeachment","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Vespeo_Razgriz","created_utc":1556382929,"title":"The Censorship Needs to End","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"RiseCascadia","created_utc":1556384632,"title":"Bernie Sanders is the most feminist 2020 candidate, as far as I'm concerned | Arwa Mahdawi","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1556390169,"title":"When Obama Talked Biden Out of Running for President \u2014 The former vice president pondered running in 2016, but Obama wanted Hillary Clinton.","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1556391518,"title":"Canada's new gay coin riles opponents \u2014 and some supporters \u2014 of LGBTQ rights","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"rytavious","created_utc":1556393978,"title":"Why is it ok to kill babies","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"JebadiahMotors","created_utc":1556394599,"title":"Help, I need some ideas","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"la_granma","created_utc":1556396878,"title":"Any other Open Society Foundation employees on here?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Ghdust2","created_utc":1556397092,"title":"The Republican War on Democracy.","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"TooMuchToDRenk","created_utc":1556397582,"title":"Advice for advocating on a college campus","num_comments":3,"description":"Me and my friends have been wanting to do something to advocate locally for our candidate.

I switched over to the Democrats so I could make sure to vote for Bernie in my state's primary. \n\n  \n\nI have been appalled at most of the things that Trump has done while in office as well as everyone in his orbit. I voted Democrat basically straight down the ticket in 2018 (except for my local election for Sheriff) hoping that Congress would begin to rein in the executive branch. I know we just go the Mueller report and that the House is calling people to testify. I\u2019m terrified, however, that all I\u2019m watching is political theater where the Democrats will wring their hands, but not actually *do* anything. \n\n  \n\nIf Barr refuses to show up the Congress, I want Congress to hold him in contempt and for that to have a *meaningful* consequence. I want the House to impeach Trump and let things go to trial in the Senate. Even if the Senate doesn\u2019t remove Trump from office, precedent will be set that behavior and choices have real consequences. \n\n  \n\nIf I don\u2019t see the House truly providing oversight to the executive, as is their responsibility, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m voting Democrat. I might as well stay home in 2020 for all the good my vote does. And I truly feel that there are many Democrats out there who feel the same way I do. \n\n  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what to do about my feelings of disappointment, other than come here and vent.

The most simple solution for if and when it\u2019s replaced is to have 1 person to 1 vote and this may be more democratic but it still has the opportunity for the majority of People to dislike the winner if two candidates split the vote against the winner.  A solution to this problem is rank choice voting.\n\nRank choice voting is a system of voting where you rank the candidates in order of your preference. Say there\u2019s 4 candidates, candidate A, B, C and D.  You like candidate A the most so you put them down as your first choice, B is your second choice, C is your third, and D is your last.  Your vote initially counts for candidate A but if there in the smallest minority than it goes to candidate B and it\u2019s the same with B and C and if after this D has the majority then they win.  This system ensures that at the very least 50% + 1  prefers the winner over the largest minority loser\n\nThe state of Main actually has a rank choice voting system that was forced in by the state legislatures after several terms of a far right wing candidate who kept winning because democrats were splitting the vote.  It\u2019s still possible for the majority to prefer one of the losers but that\u2019s a far more difficult thing to happen than in a first past the post system"},{"author":"quintol","created_utc":1557021103,"title":"The Cherokee Nation is Entitled to a Congressional Delegate in the US House of Representatives","num_comments":10,"description":"[http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/01\/05\/why-cherokee-nation-represents-the-best-of-us\/](http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/01\/05\/why-cherokee-nation-represents-the-best-of-us\/)\n\nWith the rise of racism against minorities, the Cherokee Nation taking advantage of the Treaty of New Echota, which caused the Trail of Tears, to have an active & outspoken Congressional Delegate who actually promotes Native American rights & interests could finally bring a long-persecuted minority to the political table and silence those who misuse their ethnicity."},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1557022867,"title":"Adam Schiff: \"The 2020 campaign is already in full swing and Trump just told Putin, the man behind the most serious cyber attack on our democracy ever, that he believes it was all a hoax.

Why are the democrats letting the republicans get away with so much - especially in terms of controlling the narrative? The republicans who stand for the Alabama and Georgia abortion laws say they are \u201cthe party of life\u201d. They refuse sensible gun control and say they want to \u201cprotect the second amendment\u201d.  Republicans always know how to put a positive spin on their bullshit. In reality they want to deny climate change and make fun of efforts to combat it. They want to strip healthcare away from millions, and they are imposing massive expenses on US citizens due to the trade war with China, and they have given massive tax breaks to corporations. The Democrats need to organize a massive campaign to undo the effects of the Fox News and conservative propaganda. Why can\u2019t the democrats do a better job marketing themselves as \u201cthe party for education\u201d (Warren and Sanders have both proposed substantially increasing wages for teachers). Instead of being the party for \u201cgun control\u201d why can\u2019t they say they are the party of \u201cchildren\u2019s safety\u201d. Instead of allowing theme selves to be called \u201cpro-choice\u201d why can\u2019t they be \u201cthe party for women\u2019s equality\u201d. Since the democrats want to combat climate change and generate jobs, why can\u2019t they be the \u201cparty of progress\u201d and the \u201cparty of more jobs and better wages\u201d. It just seems to me that the democrats have so many opportunists to better brand themselves and put a positive spin on the rhetoric that republicans have taken control of. They could easily discredit republicans just by running ads of things Trump has openly done. If republicans say they are the party of \u201cfamily values\u201d just constantly remind people that the republicans are the party that supports the \u201ccheating president\u201d, and \u201cpornstar president\u201d, the \u201cfailed businessman\u201d, \u201cthe president who lusts after his own daughter\u201d, and \u201cpresident who gave tax breaks to his wealthy friends\u201d. Instead of letting Trump get away with calling it a \u201ctrade war\u201d they can\u2019t call it what it is - a \u201cTrump Tax\u201d on Americans? For every good thing the Republicans claims to stand for, there is a huge list of examples of Trump doing the opposite. Why can\u2019t the democrats do a better job of controlling the narrative? A couple weeks ago I was watching an interview of Kamala Harris after the Barr hearing and the reported asked her to respond to Trumps attack calling her a \u201cnasty woman\u201d.

Casey will be over turned, every woman in United States of America will lose the right to control their body as they see fit, and we will force every female young rape victims to a life of mother hood. If they over turn the abortion laws they will go after the LGBTQ community next, revoking same sex married, making it harder to get sex reassignment surgery, taking your rights away. If the Senate is able to overturn such an important bill with ease, who knows how far they will go with this new unchecked power.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this there has been 140 school shootings in the states just this year. The environmental protection agency has lost it's budget by 31% when global warming is destroying the planet. African Americans are still plagued with racism. Native Americans are losing what little land they were left with. The Native Americans lost at Standing Rock. Women don't have a right to maternity leave. Our education minister is against public school. No one has the right to a living wage, which means no one is saving for retirement. The price of everything is going up due to an unjust tariff war. The tariff war are effecting farmers. Prison inmates are being enslaved for cheap labor. 363 people have been killed by cops this year. Half a million people are homeless. Flint Michigan still has no clean water. Texas recently revoked the freedom to assemble. The United State is the 17th in education, and last in heath care. Does this sound like a government who has their people best interest at heart?\r\n\r\nIf allegedly a president in history has allegedly rigged an election, has allegedly cheated on his taxes, allegedly blocked a FBI report to not be impeached, and is getting away with it than I expect the people of that alleged President to protest. \r\n\r\nThis is not about one gender, or race, or lifestyle, this is about every America fighting for equality, freedom and a better tomorrow. \r\n\r\nI purposely posted this on memorial day because our soldiers didn't fight for our rights, only for you to slowly lose them.

If the downtrodden realizes they have similar enemies, goals, and problems, the more likely we are to band together.\r\n\r\n2. If the first thing happens I will start a kick start to raise money for global warming, women charities, African American charities, and LGBTQ charities\r\n\r\n3. Within a month I want the people to go to every court house, and  chant \"If we don't get justice, no one does\", until the government gets the message that they have no right to take what is legally ours. I want this protest to make such a statement on American history that no future politician will dare try to pass such insensitive law.\r\n\r\nIf this post is taken down, than do we truly have free speech? If I'm sent death threats, than do we trust these people with guns? If we let the government take away the right on what a woman can do with her body so easily, what is stopping them from taking any of your rights? Either everyone has rights or no one does, either we put our foot down and say no more or we get trampled on, either we stand as a nation or we fall as an individual.\r\n\r\nI waive the right to remain silent, if you have no voice scream.\r\n\r\nSincerely.\r\n\r\nX-sir helm the snowflake.\r\n\r\nPs: I'm embracing the name snowflake, it's our perfect symbol, snowflakes a small thing, that groups into a larger thing that affects the surrounding environment, and when it freezes over it becomes a danger to anyone who treads on it.\n\nPps.

They constantly project their own crimes and malice on to their targets, pretend the vast majority of Americans are the opposite of what we objectively are (this country is *solidly* on the side of the Democratic agenda), deny how we vote, and openly conspire to stop us from doing so in the first place.  \n\nBut even that's not enough for Republicans, because they simultaneously engage in *every single election-rigging tactic known to Man*, and do it in every part of the country they hold enough control of institutions to try.\n\nAnd yet despite this, for some unknowable reason, the default position of Democratic campaigns in most parts of the country remains that if a Republican gets away with it, we officially recognize them as a legitimate officeholder.  \n\nAs we've seen with Ron DeSantis and Brian Kemp - the men who blatantly rigged their respective runs for Governor of Florida and Georgia in 2018 - this is effectively default surrender of an entire electorate's right to self-governance, and unilateral disarmament of political power.\n\nWe have essentially said to voters, \"We want to register you, persuade you to vote for us, inspire you to turn up at the polls, and if all of that works and you trust in us, we will...meekly ask Republicans to count your votes, **then go home and wait two\/four\/six more years when they refuse**.\"\n\nWe know this is foolish because we've seen how effective an assertive response can be: North Carolina Democrats in 2018 refused to go along with the blatant fraud being perpetrated by the GOP's campaign for the 9th district, and in result a new election is scheduled for this coming September.  \n\nThat kind of backbone in the face of Republican criminal tyranny should not be rare.  Shouldn't even be debatable.  It should be as automatic and determined as the response to a personal assault or threat, because that's ultimately what it is.  \n\nAs passionately as we seek votes; as determinedly as we enable them; we must vigorously defend them after the fact if we intend to keep getting them.\n\nPolitics is real, and the malice of those who would destroy democracy is not an abstraction: It is quantifiable in the poverty, death, and despair they leave in their wake whenever they hold power.\n\nOur rights are not something *conceded* to us.  **They are us**."},{"author":"DoremusJessup","created_utc":1559020204,"title":"How a large-scale effort to register black voters led to a crackdown in Tennessee","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"cheweychewchew","created_utc":1559021040,"title":"Full throttle toward impeachment: Democrats can avoid Trump's trap \u2014 if they seize the moment","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1559027511,"title":"Democrats have been seeking compromise since Clinton.

We have an age minimum of 35 to be President, perhaps we need an age maximum? Say 65? \n\nKeep in mind that the Presidency is a 4 year term at a minimum. The average life expectancy of a man in the United States is 78. Biden and Bernie would be older than this at inauguration. If they served 2 terms, they'd be 86 by the time they left office. \n\nMany older adults have cognitive impairment (some people think Reagan had it while in office) and it's not completely obvious. So, Biden or Bernie could have dementia while President and no one would know. Often times older adults with dementia make up stories that seem 100% plausible. \n\nImagine if a President was making up stories in the Oval Office? (Besides Trump) Think how dangerous this could be. \n\nRemoving a President is very difficult. When Woodrow Wilson had a stroke and was incapacitated, his wife took over. The Vice President was practically sidelined. \n\nIf Biden or Bernie got in office, they'd have a 50% chance of dying in office or having a major health problem that would interfere with their ability to be President.

I would love to hear your opinions on the matter!\n\nAlabama: Jones is the man for the job, let's crush Roy Moore or (Tommy Tuberville wtf?).\n\nAlaska: Ethan Berkowitz-I know next to nothing about Alaska, but I'm hesitant to want to see Begich be the nominee again, as he lost in 2014 and then lost in the 2018 Gubernatorial. If not Berkowitz, I have to imagine there's some other newer blood in the party who can challenge Sullivan.\n\nArizona: I love that Mark Kelly's running, I want more scientists in government. I think we saw the Arizona strategy in Sinema, and I think Kelly is moderate enough, although left of her, to take down McSally. She's also the 3rd least popular senator up for reelection in 2020 and was never elected, making her quite vulnerable.\n\nArkansas: Alright, Arkansas is not going to happen barring a miracle. But this will be the 40th year anniversary of the Miracle on Ice. Could we see history repeat itself with the US once again triumphing over Russia, this time in the presidential election? But Mike Beebe was an incredibly popular Democratic Governor, and might have the best chance in the state to at least make Cotton a bit nervous. He won't pull it off probably, but getting the GOP to put money into Arkansas would be quite glorious.\n\nColorado: This is probably our easiest seat to pick up. Gardner is barely more popular than McSally, and Colorado is moving from Purple to Blue pretty surely. I was personally most excited about Crisanta Duran, but she's running in the House, so i'm on the Dan Baer train. A former professor and diplomat, he's now the head of Colorado's Department for Higher Education. We need more teachers and people focused on education in Congress, and this is the guy. Mike Johnston is also a guy to watch out for.\n\nDelaware: I'm happy, and more importantly the people of Delaware like Coons. Get him another term!\n\nGeorgia: It's gotta be Teresa Tomlinson. The \"deal\" was Stacey for Governor and her for Senate, and with Abrams not running (VP perhaps) Tomlinson has gotta be the one.\n\nIdaho: I know nothing about Idaho, Idahoans please help!\n\nIllinois: Dick's got one more term left in him and there's no one in the field who excites me to run against him. I think it's too early for Underwood to try for the Senate although I look forward to her in the future.\n\nIowa: Speaking of young women setting the world alight in Congress, i also think its too early for Abby Finkenauer, who will be 31, to run. 2022 for Grassley's seat is most ideal for her. Back to 2020 though, Rob Sand could be a good option, the State Auditor.\n\nKansas: Kansas is probably not a possible pickup on the national stage, but Barry Grissom looks a solid choice as an established Kansas face to take on Kobach or Colyer or whoever in the General. \n\nKentucky: Look, fuck McConnell first of all. I know people are on board the Amy McGrath train, but McGrath lost in a district that is less Republican than the state as a whole (by Cook PVI) and I'd rather she went after a seat in the House again. Aside from her perhaps Edelen runs now that he's not going for Gov, or Beshear does if he loses? Ashley Judd is a potential candidate apparently, so wouldn't that be weird.\n\nLouisiana: MITCH, MITCH, MITCH. I thought he might consider a presidential run, but perhaps the Senate is more his style. Louisiana's a tough state to be a Dem, but Landrieu feels very genuine and real, and his record as Mayor of NO could make him a candidate, once again to at least push a deep red state. Some of these, it's about making the GOP work for it. No free seats.\n\nMaine: Susan Collins should be toast. The Kavanaugh vote brought her duplicity to the forefront, and her opponent will have a sizeable warchest. I was on the Susan Rice train, but now I'm looking at Hannah Pingree, or perhaps Emily Cain or Cecile Richards. A huge advocate for pro-choice taking the seat from a \"pro-choice\" person like Collins would be poetic, although i'm not sure how feasible.\n\nMichigan: According to MorningConsult, Gary Peters is the least popular Senator up for reelection. With a lot of national attention to be paid to the state, we need a really good candidate, and Peters isn't it. Unfortunately I don't know who is.\n\nMinnesota: Tina get it done.\n\nMississippi: Another unlikely one, but I'd give Mike Espy, 2018 candidate, another chance. He did quite well against Cindy Hyde-Smith, and I think he could push her hard again this time.\n\nMontana: I wanted Bullock to go for it, but in his absence, I think Michael Punke could make a good case. He's more than just the writer of the Revenant, but an advisor on trade and intellectual property law.\n\nNebraska: No Democratic members of Congress, I really have no idea who could run for this.\n\nNew Hampshire: Shaheen is very popular in her state, I think she can comfortably win reelection.\n\nNew Jersey: Booker is not a very likely Presidential nominee, so I think he'll be elected to another term.\n\nNew Mexico: Xochitl it's not quite your time. Ben Ray Lujan would make a solid candidate in another state that's nearly blue by now.\n\nNorth Carolina: Jeff Jackson hasn't announced, but he fits a new group of young Democratic veterans who are running for office. He's solidly progressive but with a military pedigree, and would be a great choice to beat Tillis.\n\nOklahoma: Brad Henry is another popular Dem Governor who could push Inhofe here. Kendra Horn is an exciting choice, but I don't want her to be a sacrificial lamb.\n\nRhode Island: Jackkkkk REEED!\n\nSouth Carolina: Another long shot, but Mandy Powers Norrell is a solid candidate to give Graham a run for his money.\n\nSouth Dakota: Let's give Billie Sutton another chance, why not?\n\nTennessee:The Minority Leader of the Senate, Jeff Yarbro, could be a solid choice to run for the open seat here.\n\nTexas: I'm going to be honest, Beto is my favorite candidate in the Democratic primary right now, and his town hall in particular delivered and dispelled the notion that he's all image no substance. However, he's falling behind in the race, and if he doesn't start to make his way back into the top 5 by around October or November, I think he needs to run for Senate. Cornyn is less hated than Cruz, but he also is less liked, he essentially just hides out. I want to take the fight to him. If Beto hopefully gains some ground, then look out for MJ Hegar or my sleeper, Colin Allred, to take Cornyn on.\n\nVirginia: Warner is i believe the richest person in the Senate, which I don't love, but none of the people in Congress I like (Wexton, Spanberger) are going to do as well in the General I imagine.\n\nWest Virginia: Let's give JFK with tattoos, AKA Richard Ojeda a chance. There's no way Swearingen gets close to winning, environmental activists just can't win in that state right now. Let's give the veteran populist a chance. \n\nWyoming:I have no idea, just don't let Liz Cheney win please.\n\nSo some of these are clearly more educated than others, so i'd love to hear your thoughts and critiques. Who do you all think should be running for each of these seats, who would be the best candidate?"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1560195818,"title":"Missouri senator says it\u2019s a waste of time to study history because it was a long time ago: Sen.

I would love to hear your opinions on the matter!\n\nAlabama: Jones is the man for the job, let's crush Roy Moore or (Tommy Tuberville wtf?).\n\nAlaska: Ethan Berkowitz-I know next to nothing about Alaska, but I'm hesitant to want to see Begich be the nominee again, as he lost in 2014 and then lost in the 2018 Gubernatorial. If not Berkowitz, I have to imagine there's some other newer blood in the party who can challenge Sullivan.\n\nArizona: I love that Mark Kelly's running, I want more scientists in government. I think we saw the Arizona strategy in Sinema, and I think Kelly is moderate enough, although left of her, to take down McSally. She's also the 3rd least popular senator up for reelection in 2020 and was never elected, making her quite vulnerable.\n\nArkansas: Alright, Arkansas is not going to happen barring a miracle. But this will be the 40th year anniversary of the Miracle on Ice. Could we see history repeat itself with the US once again triumphing over Russia, this time in the presidential election? But Mike Beebe was an incredibly popular Democratic Governor, and might have the best chance in the state to at least make Cotton a bit nervous. He won't pull it off probably, but getting the GOP to put money into Arkansas would be quite glorious.\n\nColorado: This is probably our easiest seat to pick up. Gardner is barely more popular than McSally, and Colorado is moving from Purple to Blue pretty surely. I was personally most excited about Crisanta Duran, but she's running in the House, so i'm on the Dan Baer train. A former professor and diplomat, he's now the head of \n\nColorado's Department for Higher Education. We need more teachers and people focused on education in Congress, and this is the guy. Mike Johnston is also a guy to watch out for.\n\nDelaware: I'm happy, and more importantly the people of Delaware like Coons. Get him another term!\n\nGeorgia: It's gotta be Teresa Tomlinson. The \"deal\" was Stacey for Governor and her for Senate, and with Abrams not running (VP perhaps) Tomlinson has gotta be the one.\n\nIdaho: I know nothing about Idaho, Idahoans please help!\n\nIllinois: Dick's got one more term left in him and there's no one in the field who excites me to run against him. I think it's too early for Underwood to try for the Senate although I look forward to her in the future.\n\nIowa: Speaking of young women setting the world alight in Congress, i also think its too early for Abby Finkenauer, who will be 31, to run. 2022 for Grassley's seat is most ideal for her. Back to 2020 though, Rob Sand could be a good option, the State Auditor.\n\nKansas: Kansas is probably not a possible pickup on the national stage, but Barry Grissom looks a solid choice as an established Kansas face to take on Kobach or Colyer or whoever in the General.\n\nKentucky: Look, fuck McConnell first of all. I know people are on board the Amy McGrath train, but McGrath lost in a district that is less Republican than the state as a whole (by Cook PVI) and I'd rather she went after a seat in the House again. Aside from her perhaps Edelen runs now that he's not going for Gov, or Beshear does if he loses? Ashley Judd is a potential candidate apparently, so wouldn't that be weird.\n\nLouisiana: MITCH, MITCH, MITCH. I thought he might consider a presidential run, but perhaps the Senate is more his style. Louisiana's a tough state to be a Dem, but Landrieu feels very genuine and real, and his record as Mayor of NO could make him a candidate, once again to at least push a deep red state. Some of these, it's about making the GOP work for it. No free seats.\n\nMaine: Susan Collins should be toast. The Kavanaugh vote brought her duplicity to the forefront, and her opponent will have a sizeable warchest. I was on the Susan Rice train, but now I'm looking at Hannah Pingree, or perhaps Emily Cain or Cecile Richards. A huge advocate for pro-choice taking the seat from a \"pro-choice\" person like Collins would be poetic, although i'm not sure how feasible.\n\nMichigan: According to MorningConsult, Gary Peters is the least popular Senator up for reelection. With a lot of national attention to be paid to the state, we need a really good candidate, and Peters isn't it. Unfortunately I don't know who is.\n\nMinnesota: Tina get it done.\n\nMississippi: Another unlikely one, but I'd give Mike Espy, 2018 candidate, another chance. He did quite well against Cindy Hyde-Smith, and I think he could push her hard again this time.\n\nMontana: I wanted Bullock to go for it, but in his absence, I think Michael Punke could make a good case. He's more than just the writer of the Revenant, but an advisor on trade and intellectual property law.\n\nNebraska: No Democratic members of Congress, I really have no idea who could run for this.\n\nNew Hampshire: Shaheen is very popular in her state, I think she can comfortably win reelection.\n\nNew Jersey: Booker is not a very likely Presidential nominee, so I think he'll be elected to another term.\n\nNew Mexico: Xochitl it's not quite your time. Ben Ray Lujan would make a solid candidate in another state that's nearly blue by now.\n\nNorth Carolina: Jeff Jackson hasn't announced, but he fits a new group of young Democratic veterans who are running for office. He's solidly progressive but with a military pedigree, and would be a great choice to beat Tillis.\n\nOklahoma: Brad Henry is another popular Dem Governor who could push Inhofe here. Kendra Horn is an exciting choice, but I don't want her to be a sacrificial lamb.\n\nRhode Island: Jackkkkk REEED!\n\nSouth Carolina: Another long shot, but Mandy Powers Norrell is a solid candidate to give Graham a run for his money.\n\nSouth Dakota: Let's give Billie Sutton another chance, why not?\n\nTennessee:The Minority Leader of the Senate, Jeff Yarbro, could be a solid choice to run for the open seat here.\n\nTexas: I'm going to be honest, Beto is my favorite candidate in the Democratic primary right now, and his town hall in particular delivered and dispelled the notion that he's all image no substance. However, he's falling behind in the race, and if he doesn't start to make his way back into the top 5 by around October or November, I think he needs to run for Senate. Cornyn is less hated than Cruz, but he also is less liked, he essentially just hides out. I want to take the fight to him. If Beto hopefully gains some ground, then look out for MJ Hegar or my sleeper, Colin Allred, to take Cornyn on.\n\nVirginia: Warner is i believe the richest person in the Senate, which I don't love, but none of the people in Congress I like (Wexton, Spanberger) are going to do as well in the General I imagine.\n\nWest Virginia: Let's give JFK with tattoos, AKA Richard Ojeda a chance. There's no way Swearingen gets close to winning, environmental activists just can't win in that state right now.

If you're in one of these five states, this is big!\n\nIn New Jersey, there are elections for all 80 seats in the General Assembly, the lower chamber of the state legislature. The primary election just happened on June 4, and the general is November 5th. Dems currently hold a 54-26 advantage over Republicans. The registration deadline is 21 days prior to the vote, so October 14th.\n\nIn Mississippi, both chambers of the state legislature are holding elections. All 122 seats in the HoR, and all 52 seats in the Senate are up. Dems hold 45 to Republicans 74 in the House, with 3 other, and we are down 19 to 33 in the Senate. This is a very unlikely pickup opportunity, but we can certainly bring ourselves closer in both chambers with high turnout. The primary election is not until August 6th, and clerks must receive the registration documents by July 27th at the latest. For the general, registration is due October 26th.\n\nLouisiana has the governorship up for grabs, as well both chambers, of which all seats are available. The Primary is on October 12, and the General election is November 16th. Registration is due September 11 in person or the 21st online. Voting for Bel Edwards is highly important, but trimming the 23 and 11 seat leads in the chambers would be a great accomplishment in addition.\n\nLastly, Virginia, our best pickup opportunity, where all seats are available. We are currently losing 49-51 in the House of Delegates, and 19-21 in the Senate. That means flipping two seats in both would give us a Democratic trifecta in the state. That's absolutely massive. The primary was just last Tuesday the 11th, and the General is November 5th. The registration deadline is October 15th. Make sure you register!\n\nThat's all for now, but keep these off-year elections on your radar."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1560805802,"title":"Dear Democrats,","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"hornet7777","created_utc":1560806336,"title":"BTRTN 2020 Vision: The Warm Up Act is Over, It\u2019s Debate Time","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"2ustice2","created_utc":1560806771,"title":"Meet the mysterious conservative lawyer who keeps turning up in the Russia probes","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1560806803,"title":"London Mayor Says Donald Trump Is a 'Poster Boy for the Far-right Movement': 'That Should Cause Us Huge Concern'","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1560809163,"title":"Tom Nichols: \"It is hard to read this tweet in any way other than: \"I am terrified that Vladimir Putin will read this story and believe it, so I will say that it is not true and attack the NYT for reporting it.\" The President's very personal fear of Putin is palpable\" -- Donald J.

What they mean for your candidate, for you, and what they mean for the Democratic nomination.","num_comments":0,"description":"So, it's no surprise that Donald Trump is inspiring a lot of novice first time and second time voters to get registered and get to the polls to cast a ballot against him.  We welcome you all to the good fight, thanks for showing up!\n\nBut...whenever we get brand new voters, we get brand new people that know nothing about politics beyond School House Rock.  This leads to a lot of bad feelings where people feel like they are being cheated because they didn't realize that they had to actually register to vote.  Or that Democrats use a system of Super Delegates.  Or that something called the Electoral College exists.\n\nSo, while I encourage everyone reading this to google their states rules on registering and voting in the primaries\/caucuses, and registering and voting in the general...instead I want to talk to people about how the Democratic Primaries work when we have such a large field of Candidates.\n\nNamely: \n\n#VIABILITY THRESHOLDS\n\n*What is it?* ::  A Viability threshold is the minimum percentage of the vote count a candidate must receive before they will be awarded any delegates for that state's primary\/caucus.  Every state is allowed to set their Viability Threshold wherever they want, but most states use a 15% benchmark (Including the first 4 Primary\/caucus states of IA, NH, NV, and SC).  \n\n*What does that mean?* :: That means that for a candidate to receive delegates in any state's contest, they must get at least 15% of the vote at the state or congressional district level.  At that point, delegates are awarded proportionally.  If a candidate does not meet the viability threshold, they DO NOT receive any delegates.  Any proportional delegates that a candidate would have received are then free to pledge their support for any VIABLE candidate.  If NO candidate is viable, the state level board would need to make a call, but that situation has not occurred before that I know of, and is unlikely to occur in 2020.\n\n*Wait?  So my candidate might not get any delegates?* :: It's very possible.  Let's look at a few practical examples Below\n\n[The most recent poll done for the state of Iowa](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B6m3FrMzNqO5Sm5SVnVXZHBkOVpPQXpXX0pPWF9YSHhVb1g0\/view) shows Joe Biden receiving 30% of the vote, Bernie Sanders receiving 22% of the vote, and no other candidate crossing the viability threshold of 15% (although Warren and Buttigeig come close).  \n\nIf all things remained equal, and no one drops out, then if Iowa were held today, Joe Biden would receive about 30% of Iowa's 41 delegates, Bernie would get about 22% of Iowa's delegates, and the remaining 48% would be \"At - Large\" and would have to switch their support to Biden or Bernie.  No other candidate would receive delegates.  \n\nNow, let's say Warren came in a strong 3rd in Iowa with 14% of the vote, she could definitely campaign off that.  She could claim momentum.  But she could not claim delegates.\n\n\nLet's take another example.\n\n[The latest Polling in Nevada](https:\/\/www.monmouth.edu\/polling-institute\/documents\/monmouthpoll_nv_061219.pdf\/) Shows Joe Biden getting 36% of the vote, Elizabeth Warren getting 19% of the vote..and no other candidate reaching viability.  That means if the Nevada Caucus were held today, then all 36 Nevada Delegates would be split between Biden and Warren.  No other candidate would receive delegates.\n\n#SO WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN, WHY ARE YOU TELLING US THIS?\n\nI don't want a repeat of 2016...where a mechanism like super delegates, which had existed for roughly 42 years at that point, to suddenly be portrayed as the boogeyman and a method of \"rigging\" the primary.  \n\nI have also heard MANY MANY MANY redditors who support certain candidates insisting \"It doesn't matter what the polling says, my candidate doesn't need to win the primaries, they can go into the convention with a *plurality* of votes and everyone will switch to them because they will see how awesome s\/he is\".\n\nViability Thresholds are necessary to make sure that a clown car full of candidates (24 at last count) who are not seriously running don't clear the field for some crazy person to take our nomination, a la Trump.  They are not mysterious.  They are not sinister.  They are not new. The DNC did not invent them in 2020 to keep your candidate down.  \n\nYou need to understand going in that having THIS many candidates vying for the nomination means that some of them will have low vote counts.  But if they cannot convince even 15% of DEMOCRATS TO VOTE FOR THEM, then how in  the hell can they beat a republican in a general election?  These vetting procedures are how we get STRONG candidates, and weed out weaker ones.  If your argument is \"The DNC is keeping my candidate down and cheating them!\" my answer is \"How in the hell can you say your candidate is viable when they can't get 15% of a vote from true believers in the party?\"\n\n#ALSO\n\nPlease understand that polls and numbers will change as we get closer to Iowa.  Candidates will drop out, their supporters will start supporting someone else.\n\nBut I hear a lot of people saying \"My candidate is only 20 points behind!  They can come back!\".  No.  No.  Your candidate is probably not able to come back.  Maybe they can!  But probably not.  \n\nOne of the reasons I am pointing this out is because currently [The most recent poll out of Florida](https:\/\/www.monmouth.edu\/polling-institute\/documents\/monmouthpoll_nv_061219.pdf\/) Shows that Joe Biden, with 41% of the vote, is the ONLY candidate that meets the Viability Threshold in that state, and if the Primary were held today, he would get all 214 delegates from Florida.  So far Biden is the only candidate meeting viability in a number of delegate heavy states.  \n\nIowa is 8 months away, anything can happen.  But I already see MULTIPLE reddit conspiracy theories about how Biden is \"rigging\" the election by being popular.  I don't want people to be blindsided by Viability Thresholds and think they are some evil establishment plot.  I will be posting this exact same thread multiple times between here and February, for all the good it will do.  If you support beating Trump, help spread the word, feel free to copy and paste my post...Just so we don't have a depressed Democratic turnout because well meaning, but uninformed, voters feel disenfranchised when their candidate gets 8% of a vote count, but no delegates."},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1560914052,"title":"Senate Republicans firm up opposition to protecting U.S. elections from Russian hacking","num_comments":14,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1560915231,"title":"Behold Trumponomics seems like it ll build a new order.","num_comments":4,"description":"Trumponomics opposes both international socialism and absolute free market capitalism, arguing that their views represent a third position.

Before, I continue my father is a health care executive, so I definitely have a horse in this race. However, American Sickness (the NYT says it solves Health Care) cited his idea as a main avenue to providing cost efficient health care to the masses. In other words, my dad runs a giant public health care fund, where knee replacements are the highest cost (I will get back to that later), so he capped how expensive the knee replacements could be (which means instead of going to the most expensive knee doctor, patients decide between cheaper options saving money for both the insurers and those insured). So, to say that I am the spawn of Satan who makes his living off sick old grannies is a little bit of an overstatement. The problem with American Health Care is not necessarily the system but the culture. We are the world wide leader in medical research (we produce more research than the rest of the world combined), Cuba has the best socialist health care system (or at least a really good one) and they buy all of our old stuff. This is obviously due to systems we have in place to fast track medical research. Although that in its self has helped create the opioid crisis, it was set up to fight the AIDs epidemic, and is more of a problem with oversight than with the system (also how's the AIDS epidemic going, because I just saw Magic Johnson quit his job on live TV, so that disease isnt a death sentence anymore). So, inevitably when leading the race for discovery, cost will be higher than average. Next, doctors visits are very short in America. We are the fast food culture, who invented the idea of a drive thru. So, we expect the same treatment from our doctors. Do you need a knee replacement and have the insurance, you can be in surgery within the next hour. While in countries like Canada, who has free health care, the waiting time for such minor (they are major but they are minor because it is not life or death) surgeries can be up to three months. The turn over rate in America, and the speed in which we expect service, literally implodes the cost of health care. But, it seems like nobody will acknowledged said fact. Finally, as a collective Americans are extremely unhealthy. We are laughed at around the world for being fat and stupid. However, America's obesity problem quickly becomes a problem for the entire system. Knee replacements which are make up for a ton of the costs within health care (the costs have tripled since 93), are basically because we a so fucking fat. Being this fat, makes health care not only impossible but extremely expensive (it is also your body so you will want top of the line service if you have insurance even if you cant necessarily pay for said service). To summarize, as Americans we are fat so our health care cost go up, we also like our service quickly which makes costs go up, and finally we are doing the most research and development which inevitably implodes the cost. So, basically our own culture literally makes health care even more expensive that it already would be in a diverse country of 300 million. So, in my mind the first thing we need to do to change health care is change America's culture (and maybe make a law that would mandate everyone had insurance, and instead of setting up a place to buy said insurance Obama Care, maybe do a car insurance thing where there are levels but whatever). This isnt a very insightful thing to say, or very proactive, so that's why I believe no politicians discuss the underlying principles that make our costs so high. I just think people dont understand or not aware of the other side of the argument. My dad is a good dude, who wants to give you cheep and affordable health care. I mean he voted for Obama both times, even though it could destroy his industry. Not because he is a liberal cheese ball, but because he does believe in the ideals of free health care. He just thinks there are underlying cultural problems that nobody is addressing.  P.S. Sorry if I sound like a whiny rich kid, I just hear this argument every time Im home, and wanted to share it with the masses"},{"author":"programwitch","created_utc":1560958549,"title":"Oklahoma Supreme Court denies challenge to petition for Medicaid expansion","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"serfusa","created_utc":1560959285,"title":"Reconciliation Ticket","num_comments":7,"description":"We have a ton of high quality candidates in the primary.

Here\u2019s some of my thoughts..","num_comments":14,"description":"First of all I don\u2019t really have an outlet to talk about politics; my friends aren\u2019t too interested in it and it\u2019s a subject I try very hard to keep away from my family because they believe I\u2019m too young to understand it. Hopefully this can be a way for me to let some ideas out :)\n\nI really wish I would have heard more from Klobuchar tonight!! She was making some really great points, advocating good policies, and is a person that I think is refreshing to see on stage. I know it\u2019s not her fault that she might not have gotten as much speaking time, but it would have been nice to hear her ideas on some more issues.\n\nSpeaking of candidates I wish I heard more from, I was surprisingly underwhelmed by Elizabeth Warren! I expected to hear a lot more from her considering her place in the polls and I feel like a lot of other people may have been unimpressed by her tonight.\n\nI used to like Beto BEFORE he was running for president, I thought he had enough energy from the people and the fresh face needed to propel himself to a high position in the polls. Lately though, he seems to just be pandering and only addressing the same topics. For example, I\u2019m sure most people can agree with me that it was weird when he started speaking spanish at random points. He was also definitely caught off guard by Julian Castro when they were being asked about the legality of undocumented border crossings.\n\nTim Ryan, Jay Inslee, and John Delaney don\u2019t seem to be progressing forward in this election in my opinion. I had only heard of Delaney before tonight but didn\u2019t really know any of policies, the other two didn\u2019t impress that much.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to watch the debate tomorrow night! Poor Bernie has been in politics for so long and I don\u2019t feel like he has the steamroller personality needed to beat Trump in this election. I\u2019m really interested to see what the response will be to what Yang has to say, not enough people are taking the future of automated jobs into consideration.\n\nThe problem with dems in this race is that we need to find our own Trump; someone who can ignite passion in their followers and get more people involved in politics. The hardest thing to do this time around will be to take down someone who has mustered up a seemingly enormous group of people who blindly follow a disgraced leader. We still have tomorrows debate to watch, but we really need someone to take charge and show America that they have the ability to govern our country and handle the issues that our citizens really care about."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1561607350,"title":"We will have a thread going to during tomorrow's debate.

American ,when I grew up the majority of my freinds and peers in general were black.Growing up I would call my freinds \u201cmy boys\u201d or my boy.no one batted an eye and it was met back with a mutual response.So I don\u2019t want to hear about that fake outrage shit.\n\nEnough of that though .Kamala Harris needs to be quickly eliminated from the dems political picture,because she\u2019s cashing a stir for her own campaign and publicity that puts others running against her in a bad position.Sound familiar?Because to me that sounds like Donald trump .Right now it looks like Joe Biden has the best chance of beating trump to me.Lets not dilly dally I\u2019m fake outrage and sweet nothings ,let\u2019s awaken ourselves to the reality that if we want trump out of office ,that all of us ..ALL OF US NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND BACK THE MOST LIKELY PERSON TO GET TRUMP OUT.whether that\u2019s Elizabeth Warren,Bernie,Booker,Beto.But the REALITY is that it\u2019s probably Biden with the best chance so wake up get your head on straight don\u2019t fall victim to the media and let\u2019s come together and do what we can to make sure we are all on the same page as to who we need to vote for come time to vote .\n\nThe answer?Not who you like,but who can take down trump.\n\nIf you don\u2019t do that,then don\u2019t complain about trump.\n\nI\u2019ll be voting for the most popular democratic candidate come 2020"},{"author":"madam1","created_utc":1561853903,"title":"Trump just publicly proved he couldn\u2019t pass a middle-school civics test","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"the_dummkopf","created_utc":1561854061,"title":"The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris.

I want his words to become actions so I\u2019m putting them out here. \n\n\u201cHere is what I want:\n\nI want all 24 Democratic candidates for President to convene a joint press conference outside the worst of the facilities where toddlers are being held in their own filth with no blankets, no beds, no soap, no showers. I want all the candidates, with no exceptions, to demand the doors be opened. I want them to demand a tour.\n\nI would like the candidates to show up with people from the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders and UNICEF. I want the candidates to personally render aid to the children -- on camera. At the very least, I want it on camera when officials refuse entry to a federal facility by senators, congress people, governors and the national press. I want to see the guards showing their guns to block them.\n\nI want this planned carefully. I want it publicized before, during and after. I want Fox News shamed into being there, then I want Fox News shamed into showing it. I want the candidates to agree to stand together, unified, and be prepared to stay for hours. I want them to only grant interviews in teams and I want them to keep on topic. I want no self promoting words from anyone. I want them to allow their actions to speak.\n\nI want the DNC to set up everything necessary for a rally -- refreshments, stands, shelter -- and make sure this event is open to the public and well publicized beforehand. I want to see everyone unified in naming this part of the USA's new Concentration Camp system. No equivocating. I don't want any more lip service to outrage -- I want us to SEE the outrage in such a way that anyone who is turning a blind eye to the outrage can no longer deny its existence.\n\nThe logistics for this would be hard, but you cannot convince me it cannot be done, if there really is a will to save these children, there is a way.\nWould that be blatantly using children for political props? Maybe, but it would definitely be an attempt to rescue children who are already being used as political props.\n\nI want someone to do something for those babies.

What is that balance like?\n\n01:15:50 to Juli\u00e1n Castro - Who pays for the mitigation to climate for people who are perhaps living in places that they shouldn't be living. Is this a federal government issue that needs to do that? Do they have to move these people? Maybe they're building a house some place that isn't safe. Who pays to build that house and how much should the government be bailing them out?\n\n01:17:05 to Tim Ryan - A lot of the climate plans include pricing\/taxing carbon in some way.

Are you telling Democratic voters that diversity shouldn't matter when they're making this decision?\n\n01:03:40 to Kirsten Gillibrand - Please weigh in on this.\n\n01:04:30 to Michael Bennet - Should voters believe that somehow if there is a Democratic president in 2021 that [congressional] gridlock is going to magically disappear?\n\n01:06:10 to Joe Biden - It does sound as if you haven't seen what's been happening in the US Senate over the last 12 years. It didn't happen. Why?\n\n01:07:05 Michael Bennet - on bipartisanship and gridlock\n\n01:07:40 Kirsten Gillibrand - on corruption in Washington and elections\n\n01:08:35 to Bernie Sanders - What is your plan if Roe v.

What was he charged in was it 2008 only to be left off.\n\nThis is such a let down from our government.  How could the judicial system  allow his behavior to continue?   How in the world was the FBI and other intelligence agencies blind sided by this behavior?  Did they actually turn the other way in the face of evidence they should have been able to pull together before Epstein continued with this behavior?\n\nWe deserve better from our government involving the rich and powerful or really any other perp out there that somehow skates by when evidence is available to gather to prevent these heinous acts from continuing.\n\nI expect to get few upvotes for this post and to not get a response from the reddit community that this has reached that many people.  That is a shame.  Seems overly apathetic response to something our government is more than capable of fixing.\n\nI understand that Epstein had connections to Trump and I believe Clinton.

These voters seem mostly motivated by Trumps nativist tendencies \/ showcasing him as patriotic and Dems as unpatriotic people who don\u2019t love their country. \n\nI have traditionally thought of two major voting coalitions in this country as the bedrock of our two party system: liberals \/ moderate Dems and traditional republicans. If we lump liberals \/ moderate Dems into one coalition, then we can lump traditional republicans into another. I characterize traditional republicans as primarily focused on tax cuts \/ conservative judges \/ and abortion as the key driver of their support for Republican candidates. These are the republicans I think of when I look at the support of past Republican nominees such as Bush \/ Romney \/ Reagan (country-club republicans).\n\nThese traditional republicans are undoubtedly supporting trump Bc of judges \/ taxes, but for some reason I have a hard time picturing the people at his rallies \/ his base as traditional republicans. They seem primarily motivated by a nativist \/ xenophobic \/ white nationalist agenda, and my question is where did they come from? They are coalition 3 to me, and what if Trump has brought them into politics all by himself? Are they new voters who are specifically only supporting trump who guided them into supporting the broader republicans for the time being? \n\nMy theory is that trump has successfully merged coalitions 2 and 3 into his support, even though they were previously at war. \n\nVoters of coalition 3 they hate paul ryan \/ mitch mcconnell (coalition 2)  and steve bannon made a career of trying to get rid of them LOL. They\u2019re the ones that got rid of Eric cantor in the primary for example and booed Paul Ryan + cheering trump while they shared the same Wisconsin stage.\n\nIf he\u2019s formed essentially a new voting coalition (primarily in rural areas) that currently is voting republican just Bc of him, what happens when he leaves haha? Do they stay voting republican (resulting in the Republican Party consisting of only coalition 2), form their own separate party, or sit out politics entirely?\n\nAnd these voters all voted in the Republican primary in 2015 and gave him 30% of the total Republican support, so the easy answer is they were existing republicans just voting in the primary. But what if they are completely new Republican voters who registered to vote for him specifically?"},{"author":"JLBesq1981","created_utc":1563426093,"title":"\"It's Going to Be Staggering, The Amount of Names\": As the Jeffrey Epstein Case Grows More Grotesque, Manhattan and DC Brace for Impact.","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"Readingit939","created_utc":1563428139,"title":"Great opinion piece by Thomas Friedman.

And no religion too\".\n\nFor me and many other like minded citizens of this great country, the Ex-Beatles was telling the truth against the beliefs of 7 to 8 billion people of this world who say in unison, \" Yes, there is a place called heaven where I'll go after my death before I'm reborn into a better life.\"\n\nNow, on the flip side, the same number of people of this earth also believe that there is a place called \"Hell\" where those of us who don't follow God's way \"will descend when our lives are cut short.\"\n\nSo if this is what happens to us as per the doctrines of all the religion, then why some of the lesser mortals like Trump and most of his White Evangelical followers behave so badly and get away with pure murders.\n\nBy the same token I hope everyone on this great country knows the fact that our Catholic and White Evangelical Churches are run by the so called Christ's fake followers like Jerry Falwell of Liberty University et Al. \n\nTo which I tell those ignorant Americans they should know that these so called self-proclaimed true Christians of this country who want to save an unborn child in the U.S. by banning abortions all over the country but doesn't mind when Trump looks the other way to the slaughter of thousands of starving children in Yemen by his business associate and his partner-in-crime : M.B.S., a prince of Saudi Arabia who just ordered the strangulating and then dismembering the body of Jamal Khashoggi, an U.S. Resident and the journalist of Washington Post, with a bone saw.\n\nAs per Jamelle Bouie's article \"The Joy of Hatred\" in today's NYT, the main theme of White Supremacy's doctrine is to eliminate the non-White race from U.S.\n\nJerome wants us to believe that Trump and his Republican allies like Mitch McConnell are now promoting Trump's very hard core White Evangelicals and other all White followers to do just the same.\n\nI as a believer of Mr. Bouie's article strongly believe that these low lives who throng to Trump's rallies want to bring back the lynching in the U.S. in any form possible. \n\nThat is the reason I really wonder what role their religion plays when they enter into several nightmarish howls of hatred like we saw in their recent chant of \"Send her back\" which Trump initiated at our Democratically elected Congress woman Ilhan Omar. \n\nTo me and many other Democrats that is nothing but Trump and his supporters' long held longings or desires of bringing back the red meat from America's past through their death curling howls with horrible chants at all of Trump's rallies.\n\nIt is very ironic that Trump and his devil like followers do not realize that the color of the blood of a Black or a Brown man or a Black and Brown woman or a Black and Brown child, is also red. \n\nSomehow in a carnival like atmosphere of Trump's rally, those descendants, of the White rally going mobs of the lynching of 1893 in Paris,Texas which Jamelle has described in today's article and other lynching in America, presume that the color of the blood of the Black and Brown persons like 17 year old Black kid called Mr. Henry Smith of Paris, Texas whom they burnt alive in 1893 and the color of current Muslim Congress woman Ms. Ilhan Omar's blood, is black.

A lot of things that the majority of the country agree with. However, they just sit collecting dust in the Senate. The Dems should be shouting this stuff as loud as they can. The American people need to know that when they gave the Dems the House back, the House actually is trying to get the work done. \n\nThere are a lot of other examples but I would be all day.\n\nI'm bringing this up again because of the Mueller hearings today. \n\nIt should have been known to everyone in America that, at the last minute, AG Barr limited what Mueller could talk about during his hearings today . \n\nRobert Mueller refused to answer a lot of questions.  Why did the Dems allow him to refuse to answer questions that were not classified or covered under Executive Privilege. (Not that I think that should apply here). They could have at the very least held a private hearing to get some of the answers.  If you are addicted to politics these days like myself, you learned pretty much nothing new. The things you wanted answers to, did not get answers. Things he did answer, he did in legalease. The everyday person does not understand that. A lot of people smarter than me dont always understand that. Why couldn't we reframe the questions in everyday english? \n\nExample:\n\nCongress: What did Trump do?\n\nMueller: Legal speak. He lied. Legal speak. He got help from Russia. Legal speak. He obstructed. Legal speak.\n\nCongress: So your saying he lied, got help from Russia and obstructed?\n\nMueller: Yes.\n\nFinally, what I'm feeling really irritated about is the main stream media and the Dems PR efforts. \n\nI am not a 'Fake News' person. However, I know they played a large part themselves in Trump being elected. And now they are still doing this kind of stuff. Right away, all the MSM channels were saying the same thing. The Dems lost\/ The Dems are feeling bad about how this went\/ The Dems did not get anything out of this. I have seen 3 different channels, and multiple shows on each all talk about how this hearing did not 'move the needle\". This makes everyone watching feel the same way. The media should have been replaying clips from the hearings and analyzing the questions asked and the answers given. Not controlling the narrative with their personal opinions or dissecting peoples characters.\n\nWe should have walked out of those chambers with huge smiles and told the whole world we felt great about how the hearings went. They got the report examined on tv by the guy who wrote it. They got confirmation that Trump committed crimes. They have hours of footage from today that should be shared all over the place. In one to three minute videos of questions and answers. Sharable talking points and information. There is no reason a couple of the exchanges today couldn't have gone viral. Going viral helps get the message to our fellow citizens who don't follow politics all day everyday and people who had to work during the hearings that are not going to go home and watch hours of testimony .\n\nWe knew going into today that Mueller did not want to be there  and has not shown a need to explain his report in a way the American people could understand. We knew that he was not going  to be creating sound bites on his own today. Shouldn't we have already had a strategy for this?\n\nHow do we get the Dems to control their own narrative ?  ( I don't mean to lie about things) . To  be enthusiastic  and attention grabbing?  To be the countries hype men\/women? How do we get the MSM to stop presenting personal opinions as facts?  ( I think someone should organize a MSM blackout until they agree to stop the excessive coverage of every little manufactured crisis.)\n\nI think we definitely should have felt like we had a win today. I think we dropped the ball by not adding a little spin to it.  I also really think if we don't get better at this PR thing, we could lose 2020.\n\nWhat do you think?"},{"author":"derLinuss","created_utc":1564035709,"title":"Date to choose a democratic canidate for 2020?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"nobodycares65","created_utc":1564039852,"title":"Puerto Rico governor to resign after mass protests","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Cirgud","created_utc":1564044495,"title":"Boris & Trump's Deadliest Trick, w Stephen Fry.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"regees","created_utc":1564045479,"title":"Public Gerrymandering.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"thefirststoryteller","created_utc":1564057205,"title":"Biden leads Trump in hypothetical Ohio match-up, poll shows","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1564059358,"title":"Biden Is Only Leading Dem To Top Trump In Ohio, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Former V.P.

The point is we should all help one another out regardless of wealth, skin color, or gender because we want to, not because the government tells us to. And we should not be entitled and demand givings but rather humbly accept what others are willing to give. But when the government simply takes taxes and creates a permanent entitlement service, it eliminates that empathy and connection people have with each other when they voluntarily give and receive.\n\nThe Republican party believes in reducing taxes for all because people should be able to keep as much of their money as possible. In particular, businesses are given tax cuts because Republicans are practical. I understand that Democrats have their opinions that the rich SHOULD pay more taxes. That's a very ideological approach, but what good does that do in the real world? Raising taxes on businesses will just drive them out and push them to relocate in other nations. That's reality. Tax cuts for businesses work regardless if you think they're fair or not. GDP under Trump has gotten to over 3.0% because of these tax cuts. And Republicans believe welfare should be there as a safety net for those who actually need it, not an entitlement. Nothing wrong there unless you're against getting people to be more independent and self-reliant.\"\n\nHe makes so many assumptions in his argument, and I don't know where to even start with this.

My family has always been lifelong \"JFK\" Democrats. We have considered ourselves moderate on fiscal and spending issues, and progressive on the social scale. \n\nIn theory, former VP Biden is my guy this election cycle. I prefer his moderate Democratic style over the more progressive candidates. That doesn't mean I wouldn't vote for Warren, etc. \u2014I'd vote for a shoe over Trump. But I do have a handful of concerns & hopes when it comes to his candidacy.\n\nConcerns\n- Age: Not that he's too old, but more than his age is showing on the debate stages. Trump can pound the pavement and be overly aggressive. My fear is Biden will be flustered by this\u2014as evidence showed over the past two debates. \n\n- The Party Being Split: I can't get a gauge on moderate vs. progressive in terms of the party's wing. I have a lot of friends who are very moderate Dems and prefer Biden. I also know people who think he's too moderate. This scares me in terms of turnout.\n\n- Background: Biden should not be blamed for his son\/brother's past work. But the Trump crowd will stoke these flames. Ukraine, blah, blah, blah. My fear is it becomes \"Hillary-like\" with the Clinton Foundation rhetoric. \n\nHopes\n- A Sense of Calm & Stability: One hope I have is that he's been on the national stage before. He knows world leaders, he knows the way the system works. Biden being elected automatically brings a sense of calm and stability back to the office. Something we need.\n\n- A Reset: Along the lines with calm, I feel like 4 years of Biden would be a much-needed reset. We could find a younger candidate after, but let him come in and clean up this unreal mess Trump has created. If anyone can navigate it, Joe can.\n\n- Progressive Agenda: I think those fearful Joe will be the status quo don't know him. I think he will help with progressive legislation, but also toe the line for moderates as well. I think he listens to people and I believe his VP will be a progressive choice to prove this\u2014although I'd LOVE it to be Andrew Yang.\n\n- Climate Change: I think Joe will get pushed here and make this a priority. If anyone can sell it to the Trump crowd, it's Joe. He has a connection there\u2014see next example of why.\n\n- The \"Trump\" Crowd: I have friends' parents who live FOX News. They are big Trump. They ALL say, Well if Biden was running we'd be fine with that. For whatever reason, Biden doesn't fall into the socialism, anti-Trump fear they have. I also know a bunch of Trump voters who told me that they will vote Biden bc Trump exhausts them but they couldn't vote for a Warren, Harris or Sanders.\n\nAnyway, long rant. But just felt this was a good place to air it out. Would love to see where you all are at, and what you think of the race\/Biden!"},{"author":"nationalistsareRINOs","created_utc":1565187134,"title":"Beto O'Rourke's Moral Clarity Goes Viral","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1565189113,"title":"Trump is 'primary cheerleader' for hate in America, says Sen.

Instead we are in 20th place for gun related deaths per capita.\n\nThere\u2019s nearly as many gun related deaths per year in the US alone (40,000) as US battle deaths during the entire Vietnam War (47,000).\n\nI\u2019m all for keeping regulation out of personal lives as much as possible but it\u2019s pretty ridiculous at this point.\n\nI don\u2019t think we should take guns away, that\u2019s unreasonable and impossible at this point. But things like thorough background checks for all gun sales just seems like common sense you know? The only people who need to fear those checks are basically the people with criminal backgrounds. It would be good to know that guns aren\u2019t in the hands of criminals or dangerous people. \n\nIt would be great to do what a majority of other developed countries do, which is that a person has to contact their local police to get permission to own a gun. The gun has to be purchased for a specific purpose, either hunting or for sport and the person has to provide proof that they have been involved with a gun club or hunting. There\u2019s a different license for each. That would be great. We need to look at what other successful countries are doing and do it to the best of our ability."},{"author":"timrcolo","created_utc":1565431404,"title":"I need your help!

The slightest hope of winning being replaced by the feeling of potentially being apart of one the greatest political upsets in American history as the night went on and state by state Trump's chances of winning the presidency increased. I remember the unfamiliar restrained political commentary of the Fox News Election Night team slowly turning more and more confident, and at the same time more and more familiar. I remember the rush of joy I experienced when Trump was called the winner, the exhilaration was so great you would have thought I had won the presidency myself. \n\nI also remember the days that followed and the creeping sense of despair and dread that had began to pester underneath the surface. I remember donating the Trump\/Pence 2020 shirt that my mom got me to goodwill, not wanting to wear it anymore. I remember reality set in. In the coming weeks, I had begun to realize my views did not fit in with anything Trump said. My views didn't actually fit in with the Fox News crew's views. My views were as far from Republican as they could be. \n\nMy views had no place in the Republican Party, truly, they never did. I was Pro-Choice throughout high school, arguing that nobody had the right to police what others chose to do with their bodies. I was pro gay marriage, arguing that it was nobody's business to determine whether or not it was okay for those of the same sex to love each other. Love is love, why does it matter? I asked. I believed that African Americans were being treated unfairly in America, and believed that racism was very much alive, if not emboldened, despite the election of Obama. I believed in Immigrant rights, hated the idea of the wall, and despised the bully tactics Trump used against Hillary. \n\nAnd yet, I still voted for him. I still caved into what I had been taught by my grandpa growing up, that the Democrats were the enemy and that the Republicans the heroes, no matter who that Republican was. I have since changed my party, and am now registered as a Democrat. I have since found a home for me and my views. I have since changed where I get my news from Fox to the \"failing\" NYT, \"fake\" CNN, and \"biased\" Atlantic. I regret the decision I made in 2016 to vote for Trump, but it did teach me one thing. It taught me which party I truly belonged to. \n\nLong Story Short: Due to being indoctrinated at a young age by my family (mainly my grandpa who I still love of course) and due to watching Fox News almost daily with my Grandpa, I had a twisted sense of what was right and what was wrong. I was a Republican because I thought I was SUPPOSED to be a Republican. I thought the Republicans were the party of honesty and of God. I thought the Republicans were the good guys and that the Democrats were evil fakes. I know now how wrong I was and I am sorry for the small part I played in getting us to where we are now."},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1566591181,"title":"The speech we want to hear: \u2018This is madness\u2019 -- One of the candidates should say out loud what many Americans are thinking.

For example, his gun control record:\n\n* \"Take the guns first, due process later\"\n* The bump stock ban\n\nWith your help, I'd like to compile a list of his statements (preferably video, recordings, or images) in which Trump goes against common right-wing thought on the following issues:\n\n* Gun control.\n* Freedom of speech.\n* Immigration.\n* Lowering taxes.\n* Free trade *(not relating to Asian or middle-eastern sounding countries!).*\n* Honoring military members.\n\nSimilarly, we could use videos, recordings, or images showing clear evidence of:\n\n* Desiring more than 2 terms.\n* Insulting the intelligence of his followers.\n* Not paying taxes.\n* Conflicts of interest.\n* Dodging the draft.\n* Divorce\/infidelity.\n\nAnd any other tidbits you may know of that would anger your average bible belt republican.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll compile your suggestions into a neat categorized list of links with descriptions, and post the result. Maybe another member of this community would be interested in editing the finished list into a 10-15 minute YouTube video for more easy consumption after it's done?"},{"author":"EliteGamer1337","created_utc":1567477092,"title":"Letters to the Editor: Republicans who do nothing are the ones politicizing gun violence","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1567477439,"title":"It\u2019s Time to Try Fossil-Fuel Executives for Crimes Against Humanity","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1567478271,"title":"Why Has Trump\u2019s Exceptional Corruption Gone Unchecked? -- \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d suggests that all political corruption is the same.

His charm was not enough to save his marriage and his relationship with Marla Maples. \n\nTrump\u2019s tax returns during this period showed losses of over one billion dollars. Trump was running out of money to support his lavish lifestyle. \n\nBorn in Europe charming Glislaine Maxwell was a failing publishers daughter who\u2019s gilded life was coming to an end since her father\u2019s death. Maxwell was running out of money to support her lavish lifestyle.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*Trump and Epstein in 1992*\n\nBy the early 1990\u2019s chance meetings with Jeffrey Epstein in New York City reversed both Trump and Maxwell\u2019s pending fate. In 2019, Epstein was looking at life behind bars when he decided that ending his life would be a better fate. Maxwell and Trump are next in line for criminal court cases.\n\n**Richard Nixon Revisited**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*John Mitchell*\n\nEpstein\u2019s story begins with an introduction by John Mitchell, former Attorney General to President Richard Nixon who served time for his role in the Watergate break in. In 1987 Mitchell introduced Epstein to Steven Hoffenberg. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nHoffenberg, former owner of the New York Post, hired Epstein as a consultant and was paid $ 25,000.00 per month. Hoffenberg and Epstein worked closely together and traveled the world.\n\nIn 1997, Hoffenberg was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for operating a bill collection agency that was also a ponzi scheme, bilking investors out of almost a half billion dollars. Hoffenberg claims Epstein was intimately involved with this scheme. \n\nEpstein used funds from investors in the Ponzi scheme along with loans from Deutsche bank (fined for money laundering) to buy the properties used to lure the underage girls with the assistance of Ghislaine Maxwell.Epstein did not go to jail for his role in this Ponzi scheme.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n*Trump Epstein and Maxwell in the 1990\u2019s*\n\n**Trump's desire for sex**\n\n*Trump bragged that he could do anything with women because he was rich and famous.*\n\nIn a 1990 divorce deposition, Trump's first wife and the mother of his three eldest children Ivana Trump accused her then-husband of raping her in a fit of rage in 1989.\n\nKristin Anderson, a photographer and former model said Trump reached under her skirt and touched her vagina through her underwear [at a New York City nightclub in the early 1990s](http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/woman-alleges-trump-groped-nightclub-2016-10). Anderson said her friends, who were talking together around a table at the time of the incident, confirmed Trump\u2019s assault.\n\nCathy Heller [told the Guardian in October 2016](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2016\/oct\/15\/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller) that she was attending a Mother's Day brunch with her husband, children, and in-laws at Mar-a-Lago in the 1990s when Trump approached her table, [introduced himself to her, and forcibly kissed her](http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/cathy-heller-trump-accusations-2016-10).\n\nJill Harth, a businesswoman who worked with Trump in the 1990s, [told the Guardian in July 2016](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2016\/jul\/20\/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview) that Trump pushed her against a wall, put his hand up her skirt, and tried to kiss her at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort in the early 1990s.\n\n**Epstein meets Maxwell**\n\nJeffrey Epstein met Glislaine Maxwell in 1992. Maxwell was implicated by several of Epstein\u2019s accusers as recruiting underage girls in addition to being Epstein\u2019s girlfriend.  There is a video showing Epstein and Trump partying in late 1992. Trump is groping one of the girls. \n\nIn 1992 Trump and Epstein, at Trump\u2019s request at Trump\u2019s resort in Florida were the only male guests at a party with 28 women that were part of a calendar girl competition. Epstein was quoted as saying that he wanted to have a beauty contest  similar to what Trump had. \n\nBased on Trump\u2019s statements the two pedophiles met a few years ago when they formed business relationships that included Paul Manafort and Deutsche bank and using offshore accounts.\n\nIn the late 1990s when Trump was running low on cash he turned to Epstein and Deutsche Bank along with manafort's political Connections in Russia to help fund Trump's failing properties. No United States Banks would loan Trump money with all his bankruptcies and lawsuits.\n\nIn the early 1990s Trump and Epstein were close friends according to Epstein's brother Mark, Trump and Epstein lived next to each other in Florida.\n\n**11 year old year girl kidnapped**\n\nMaria and her mother lived in Danbury Connecticut with their 9 siblings. Maria\u2019s dad had died one year earlier. Maria\u2019s mother died in 2015. Maria was kidnapped outside of Nash\u2019s pizzeria on March 19, 1993. The girls kidnappers were involved in a child trafficking ring that provided young girls to wealthy individuals like Trump and Epstein. She was found with Jeffrey Epstein in Manhattan one year later. \n\nIn 1994, Maria Johnson was approached by an Epstein party recruiter while she was at the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal on 42nd Street in Manhattan. She was told that she might become a model if she met the right people at a fashionable party.  \n\n**Trump and Epstein Collaborate with young girls**\n\n*I\u2019ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it-Jeffrey enjoys his social life.* Donald Trump 2002\n\nIn 1994, Trump was friends with Epstein for years. Trump had attended multiple parties at Epstein's New York residence that has been described as one of the largest townhomes in the city. It had at least 7 stories and as much as 50,000 square feet with at least 40 rooms. Plenty of private space to take advantage of the young and naive.\n\nTrump and Epstein would throw parties at their Manhattan homes for mostly girls of all ages then luring them to a series of underage sex parties by promising them money and modeling careers.\n\n**Sex and the Summer of 1994**\n\nSeveral court filings indicated that a 13 year old girl named Katie Johnson (corroborated by Maria from Danbury) had at least four encounters with Trump and Epstein. Trump and Epstein forced Johnson to engage in various perverted and deparaved sex acts. The earliest encounter included having Johnson being forced to manually stimulate Trump with the use of her hand upon Trump\u2019s erect penis until he reached orgasm. \n\n**Trump and Epstein's businesses take a hit**\n\nTrump was having a bad year financially in 1994. He sold the Plaza Hotel in New York for a 83 million dollar loss. Epstein\u2019s was a principal in a bill collecting company was  exposed as a Ponzi scheme that investors lost almost one-half billion dollars. However, Epstein was not charged. \n\n**2 children performing for Trump and Epstein**\n\nTrump and Epstein, undoubtedly in foul moods from their staggering business losses commenced to argue over who would take Katie Johnson's Virginity. Johnson overheard Trump calling Epstein a Jew Bastard and that Trump should be the one to pop Johnson\u2019s cherry.\n\nThe third encounter had Johnson forced to engage in unnatural lesbian sex acts with her fellow minor and sex slave Maria from Waterbury. Maria was just 12 at the time. \n\nTrump and Epstein had the two girls perform together because when Trump met Johnson during the 4th encounter Maria was not present. Trump warned Johnson that the same thing would happen to her if she did not perform or told anyone afterward. \n\nApparently Trump while losing Millions  in real estate had won the contest with Epstein to see who would take the underage Johnson's virginity. During their fourth and final encounter, Trump took the 13 year old Johnson\u2019s virginity. Trump tied Johnson to a bed with her pantyhose. \n\nTrump responded to Johnson\u2019s repeated requests to stop by raping her and slapped her on the face and screaming he can do whatever he wanted. After the rape, Johnson asked Trump what would happen if Trump impregnated her. Trump threw some money at her and told her to get an abortion\n\nEpstein also raped the girl and in the process of assaulting the girl complaining that he should have been the one to take her virginity.\n\nDespite what Trump told Johnson about Maria it turns out that Maria became a paid agent by Epstein. Maria was employed by Epstein for over 10 years. Her job was to witness and supervise sexual encounters between Trump and Epstein and underage girls.\n\nTrump and Epstein repeatedly told Katie Johnson that she and her family would be killed if they ever spoke about what happened. Johnson was told that Trump and Epstein were very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability, and means to carry out their threats.\n\n**Trump\u2019s sexual assaults continue into the late 1990\u2019s** \n\nFormer Elle advice columnist E. Jean Carroll [accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/e-jean-carroll-accuses-trump-sexual-assault-2019-6) in a department store dressing room the mid-1990s. \"The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips,\" Carroll [wrote in an excerpt of her 2019 book](https:\/\/www.thecut.com\/2019\/06\/donald-trump-assault-e-jean-carroll-other-hideous-men.html),\"What Do We Need Men For?\".She went on, \"The next moment, still wearing correct business attire, shirt, tie, suit jacket, overcoat, he opens the overcoat, unzipped his pants, and forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway \u2014 or completely, I'm not certain \u2014 inside me. It turns into a colossal struggle.\"\n\nLisa Boyne, a health food business entrepreneur, [told HuffPost in October 2016](https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/donald-trump-models-skirts-underwear_us_57ffd172e4b0162c043ac07f) that she attended a 1996 dinner with Trump and modeling agent John Casablancas during which several other women in attendance were forced to walk across a table in order to leave.As the women walked on the table, Boyne says that Trump looked up their skirts and commented on their underwear and genitals. Trump allegedly asked Boyne for her opinion on which of the women he should sleep with.\n\n**Two Sisters unheard cries for help**\n\nMaria Farmer remembers meeting Epstein at an art gallery where she was an artist. Maria was asked by Epstein if she had a father. Epstein hired Maria to act as a doorman for his New York Townhouse having people sign in when they arrived. One evening in 1996 Trump walks in and doesn\u2019t say a word but kind of snickers as he glares at Maria. Epstein told Trump that Maria was not here for you. Farmer witnessed hundreds of girls arriving at Epstein\u2019s townhouse many she estimated to be between 13 and 15 years old. Maria\u2019s work relationship with Epstein enticed her sister Annie to Epstein\u2019s ranch in New Mexico. Annie was only 16 at the time. She was told that Epstein was going to help her with College instead she defended herself against the unwanted advances of Epstein and Maxwell. Both Epstein and Maxwell gradually took advantage of the two sisters with massages and groping. The sisters reported them to the police but nothing was done for 10 years until Epstein was finally arrested.\n\nKarena Virginia, a yoga instructor and life coach, [told the Washington Post in October 2016](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/woman-says-trump-groped-her-while-attending-us-open-tennis-tourney-in-1998\/2016\/10\/20\/a1b6caf8-956b-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html) that Trump groped her as she waited for her car outside the US Open in New York in 1998.Virginia, then 27, said she overheard Trump talking with a group of men about her legs and that Trump then approached her, grabbed her arm, and touched her breast before asking, \"Don't you know who I am?\"\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Trump and Deutsche Bank**\n\nDeutsche Bank which started in the 1870\u2019s and went global about the same time that Trump started doing business with this large German Bank. Deutsche bank in the 1990\u2019s started competing with the Wall Street Banks. The same banks that stopped lending to Trump because of his bankruptcies and lawsuits. Deutsche bank saw the price of getting into the global market was doing business with Trump. \n\nSince 2003 American and British regulators ordered Deutsche Bank to pay penalties (the largest in banking history) for laundering 10 billion of Russian money. \n\nLast November Deutsche Bank was raided by German law enforcement officers in a money laundering probe. Deutsche is currently under United States investigation on whether it complied with the laws regarding money laundering. Deutsche has been hit hard by these scandals and its stock is tethering losing all its value. If it is forced to turn over its records regarding Trump that will probably finish it off.  Trump and his son-in-law Jarod Kushner\u2019s accounts were flagged by Deutsche Bank's investigators but the officers above them did not proceed with investigating these two men. Tammy McFadden an anti-money compliance officer was fired by the bank when she brought up Trump\u2019s and Kushner\u2019s suspicious activity.\n\n**Epstein\u2019s Island**\n\nSteve Scully worked on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private Island for about 6 years starting in 1999. Scully was the father of three daughters who decided to leave his lucrative IT position because of what he saw. Scully had visited the island about 100 times during his employment. He saw revolving groups of young girls that were guests on the island. All over the island were an extensive collection of topless women images. The Miami Herald has identified 80 women who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein between 2001 and 2006.\n\n**Ghislaine Maxwell**\n\nWith Epstein committing suicide, the new crimminal focus will be on his girlfriend during the 1990\u2019s and beyond and Epstein\u2019s circle of people that assisted in child trafficing that now number at least eight. \n\nOne of the under age girls that has filed a lawsuit indicates that she was working at Trump's Mar-a-Lago when she was approached by Maxwell about a way to earn good money, learn massage therapy, and get to know Epstein as a man who could give her a bright future. The girl indicated that she was trained by Maxwell and Epstein to become everything a man wants her to be. \n\nA manager of Epsteins Palm Springs home indicates that he drove Maxwell to spas to look for young women who could do massages for Epstein, their code for sexual acts. \n\nMaxwell is one of several co-conspirators listed in recent legal filings and is either cooperating with authorities to reduce her exposure or if she is evading authorities she is sure to be indicted shortly. \n\nIn early July of this year Epstein was arrested for the alledged sex trafficking of dozens of minors. In the criminal indictment federal prosecutors claimed Epstein and his accomplishes lured girls as young as 12 to his properties to perform massages then molested them and encouraged them to recruit other girls to return with them. The victims were paid a finder's fee. Hundreds of girls are involved with Epstein receiving as many as three massages a day.. \n\nAccording to Maxwell, Epstein had a video recording system in his New York Townhouse that was used to blackmail important people and leverage their sexual activities for future favorable business dealings.\n\nA trove of court documents unsealed in early August 2019 detail allegations by an alleged victim of wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein that while working as a teenage locker room attendant at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort nearly two decades ago she was recruited to give Epstein massages that often involved sexual activity.\n\nTrump has indicated that all of the above girls are lying and that without providing any details to dispute their stories we should believe Trump when he says is is innocent. Trump has lied approximately 13 times a day or 12 thousand times since becoming President. Trump has lied more times than the 44 other Presidents combined with plenty of room to spare."},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1567709532,"title":"Bernie Sanders Pursues Joe Biden Voters As Primary Field Narrows","num_comments":5,"description":"* https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-voters-primary_n_5d7116fae4b0cdfe057b978a\n\n\nYea no thanks Bernie.

Mandatory enhanced background checks.  \n2.  Assault weapons ban.  \n\nOption 1 is pretty ineffective since most people going off committing mass shootings can either pass a background check or they\u2019ve taken their parents guns.  \n\nOption 2 while probably effective is politically more difficult.  \n\nWhat about a third option?\n\nYour gun is used in a crime, you are criminally liable for that crime.  If it kills someone accidentally, you let your weapon be used irresponsibly and are criminally liable.  Own whatever guns you want, own however many you want.  But you are 100% responsible for them.  \n\nTo me it fits the conservative tenant of personal responsibility.  When you buy a new gun the serial number is recorded by your FFL and the FBI does their background check, if you sell your gun you\u2019ll now be damn sure to record that sale with the government otherwise you remain liable for what happens with it.  If your gun is stolen you\u2019ll certainly report that since now you\u2019re terrified the gun might be used in a crime you\u2019re liable for.  People will be far more likely to keep their weapons locked up at home.  They will be more careful about leaving them in cars as well.  People that end up with unwanted guns are much more likely to get rid of them to free themselves of that potential liability.  \n\nResponsible gun owners ought to accept this responsibility since that\u2019s how they\u2019re most likely already treating their firearms.  It also adds more teeth to straw man purchases which is a primary way guns end up in criminal hands in places like Chicago and other cities and states with tougher rules in place today.  \n\nRights come with Responsibility and right now the 2nd seems to be absolutely devoid of any personal responsibility.  \n\nWhy isn\u2019t this an option being put forwards by anybody?"},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1567789897,"title":"Redistricting fights rage with future of Congress at stake","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1567790703,"title":"Report: White House Official Says Trump Personally Drew Sharpie Bubble On Map","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1567791046,"title":"States Cancelling GOP Primaries, Caucuses To Protect Trump","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"dolphins3","created_utc":1567791196,"title":"Amy Klobuchar: Here's your Friday reminder that if the GA Secretary of State hadn\u2019t been allowed to hold back 53,000 voter registrations, Stacey Abrams would be the Governor of Georgia right now.

Hospitals must make money to pay their doctors. My local hospital is already about to shut down because they don\u2019t make enough money. So how will the universal healthcare bolster their income so they can stay open? \n\n2.) Many people don\u2019t go to the doctors office because they know they can\u2019t afford it, or because they don\u2019t even have insurance. When the doors are opened for anyone and everyone, how will we have enough staff so we don\u2019t run into a similar problem Canada has?

Earlier today I had an interaction with a Trump supporter I went to high school with who stated that:\n\n>None of the language in the transcript was indicative of pressuring or any sort of quid pro quo. Did he ask? Yes, but considering we have a treaty with Ukraine that expressly addresses the topic of mutual assistance in criminal matters, it\u2019s not an outlandish or unprecedented ask.\n\nI wrote a detailed response I figured I would share here incase any of you see the same rhetoric posted elsewhere. Hope this helps at least a few of you. \n\n>There was never going to be explicit quid pro quo, but there are still some deeply concerning issues with the transcript. Trump begins by talking about how the US does a lot for Ukraine but that \"\\[Trump\\] wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily.\" This is significant because one can logically infer that the aid (which Trump was withholding) was tied to further action that Ukraine needs to take on their end (re: reciprocal.) Trump follows this by immediately talking about the Mueller investigation and asking Zelensky to look into Biden and his son. Reading between the lines of this interaction I have the following take away: Ukraine is not doing enough on their end to justify the aid they receive from the US, and one thing they can do to help justify the aid and make the relationship more beneficial for the US would be to investigate one of Trump's political rivals. Sure, Trump does not explicitly state that this take away was his intention, but this is not an outrageous impression to be left with after reviewing the interaction.   \n>  \n>To be extra clear, it is completely outlandish and unprecedented for the president of the United States to ask a foreign power to investigate a political rival. To even insinuate that your and my tax dollars will only be fully provided to one of our allies if they investigate the president's political rivals is a complete abuse of power, and why it was the breaking point on impeachment."},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1569435799,"title":"White House inadvertently sends Ukraine talking points to Democrats","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"DoodlingDaughter","created_utc":1569436569,"title":"So, I am subscribed to Trump\u2019s e-mail list, just so I can see how current events are twisted.

I understand this issue is important to you and appreciate the time you have taken to contact me.\n\nOn September 24, 2019, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House will formally consider President Trump\u2019s impeachment. That announcement was made following a whistleblower complaint based on second-hand knowledge that claimed the President threatened to withhold almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine during a phone call with Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nFortunately, we do not have to speculate as the White House has released the entire transcript. And the fact of the matter is that there was no quid pro quo and no mention of a withdrawal of U.S. aid to Ukraine. The transcript of the phone call shows the President doing his job to address issues that matter to U.S. foreign policy, specifically, corruption and interference in our 2016 election. Central to the strategy of U.S. foreign policy is the ability to discourage bad behavior including corruption and the enabling of Russian malign influence through tools such as sanctions and foreign aid.\n\nThe impeachment process should not be used as a way to reverse the 2016 Presidential Election. Congress cannot keep careening from impeachment theory to another while it should be working to lower prescription drug prices, pass the United States \u2013 Mexico \u2013 Canada Agreement, and grow our economy. These are the issues that will affect the everyday life of American citizens.\n\nI hope you will never hesitate to contact my office if we can ever be of assistance.  You can contact me directly or find out more about the services my office provides by visiting my website www.barr.house.gov.\n\nPlease stay in touch.\n\nSincerely,\n \nAndy Barr\nMember of Congress\u201d"},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1570138719,"title":"Giuliani was warned that Ukrainian claims of Bidens\u2019 misconduct were not credible, Trump\u2019s ex-envoy tells lawmakers","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Lochstar","created_utc":1570139707,"title":"Planned Protests in DC?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1570142059,"title":"Trump\u2019s angry, bizarre, self-defeating impeachment strategy: His allegations about Joe Biden\u2019s son and China are, you\u2019ll be surprised to hear, as utterly bogus as pretty much everything else he learns from trolling right-wing conspiracy theory sites.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"skepticalspectacle1","created_utc":1570142421,"title":"Trump Goes on Live Television to Do Exact Thing Whistleblower Said He Did","num_comments":16,"description":""},{"author":"gamersworld123","created_utc":1570144376,"title":"What McCarthy said to Nancy Pelosi that pleased Trump!","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1570144890,"title":"The CrowdStrike Plot: How a Fringe Theory Took Root in the White House -- \u201cUkraine is the perfect scapegoat for him, because it\u2019s the enemy of Russia.\u201d","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1570145706,"title":"Democrats in districts Trump won in 2016 face little impeachment backlash so far","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Bober0523","created_utc":1570146333,"title":"Demi Lovato is being wrongfully hated on.","num_comments":1,"description":"She recently went to Israel to be baptized in the Jordan river.

But boycotts now may get Fox News to drop Trump altogether for the following reasons:  \n\n\nThe impetus for Republicans and Fox News to abandon Trump is at a boiling point: Trump just admitted to treason. He publically asked China and Ukraine to investigate his political rival and is being impeached for it. And CNN is reporting that there is a phone transcript of him urging China to investigate Elizabeth Warren as well. The new executives at Fox are considering abandoning Trump already. If Fox News gets a little financial incentive to drop support for Trump, they will.  \n\n\nThe anger at Fox News has never been higher as a result of people like Hannity and Tucker supporting his treasonous activity.  \n\n\nDemocrats are motivated than ever before to write letters and emails to Fox News advertisers urging them to stop supporting Treason, Racism and Fascism. This means that democrats on sites like daily kos and subreddits like politics are more motivated than ever before to write letters and emails to Fox News advertisers.  \n\n\nSo let's use this opportunity and distribute this list of Fox News advertisers to every internet forum you can think of... \n\n\n**Boycotting is NOT the point. Writing letters to these companies stating that you will boycott them if they continue to advertise on Fox News is what actually makes a difference.** Those letters\/emails often times get forwarded up the chain to the people that make marketing decisions. Enough of them lead to companies adding riders to their marketing buys specifying that their ads won't be played on Fox News. This in turn leads to a loss of revenue to Fox News, and this was the reason why Fox News fired O'Reilly, in response to a boycott letters like the one at the bottom of this post. \n\nYou can even search your email inbox for marketing emails from these companies, and reply to them with a letter similar to the one templated at the bottom of this post.\n\n\nSean Hannity's leading advertisers (last updated 7\/26\/19.):  \n\n\nTrivago.com (Expedia)  \n\n\nProgressive  \n\n\nAutograph Collection Hotel\/Resort (Marriott)  \n\n\nADT  \n\n\nUSAA  \n\n\nClaritin (Bayer)  \n\n\nFord  \n\n\nSandals Hotel\/Resort  \n\n\nStamps.com  \n\n\nClearChoice Dental  \n\n\nStarKist  \n\n\nThe Zebra  \n\n\nMyPillow  \n\n\nSmart Mouth  \n\n\nCarvana  \n\n\nWeatherTech  \n\n\nSheex  \n\n\nJenny Craig  \n\n\nSimpliSafe  \n\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line  \n\n\nSanofi  \n\n\nGabi  \n\n\nCuriosityStream  \n\n\nRoman  \n\n\nEli Lilly  \n\n\nThe best list of Tucker and Judge Jeanine's adverisers I could find as of April 2019  \n\n\n[4imprint.com](http:\/\/4imprint.com\/) (Pirro) ADT (Pirro) All-State, for its Esurance (Pirro) Amazon Prime, for its new show The Widow (Pirro) Ancestry.com (Pirro) Arby\u2019s (Pirro) Aspen Dental (Pirro and Carlson) Association of American Railroads (Carlson) Bayer, for Miralax, Bayer, Alka Seltzer, and Dr. Scholl\u2019s (Pirro and Carlson) Cadillac (Pirro and Carlson) Carvana (Pirro) Celgene for Otezla (Pirro) Chattam\/Sanfoi for Gold Bond and Act (Pirro) Checkers\/Rally\u2019s (Carlson) Church & Dwight for Kaboom (Pirro) Clear (Pirro) Custom Ink (Pirro) Del Webb.com (Carlson) Ebates (Pirro) EliteSingles.com (Carlson) Gillette (Pirro) Golden Coral (Pirro) GSK for Gas-X (Pirro) Intuit Quickbooks (Pirro) Jenny Craig (Carlson) Just For Men for its ControlGX (Pirro) KAYAK (Pirro) Knightline Legal (Pirro) Liberty Mutual (Pirro) Midas (Pirro) Miracle-Ear (Carlson) Nature\u2019s Bounty (Pirro) Navy Federal Credit Union (Pirro) NFL Network (Pirro) People Media for OurTime.com (Pirro) PhRMA (Carlson) Pods.com (Pirro and Carlson) Proctor & Gamble for Crest (Pirro) Qunol (Pirro) Rakuten (Pirro) Recovery Centers of America (Pirro) Ruby Tuesday (Pirro) Samsung Galaxy (Pirro and Carlson) Sandals (Pirro) SmartMouth.com (Carlson) Toyota for Lexus and Toyota (Pirro) Trivago (Pirro) USAA (Carlson) Volvo (Pirro)  \n\n\nYou can find contact numbers, mailing addresses and emails for just about any company using this link...  \n\n\n[https:\/\/www.elliott.org\/company-contacts\/](https:\/\/www.elliott.org\/company-contacts\/)  \n\n\nHere is one example of a template that can be modified and used...  \n\n\nHi,  \n\n\nI travel often and often stay at Mariott hotels. However your company under the name Autograph Collection Hotel\/Resort (Marriott) is listed as a major adveriser on the Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson program on Fox News, your ads show on those shows.  \n\n\nThose shows regularly encourage racism against immigrants like me and my family, and they defended trump and continue to do so for illegally jailing immigrant children as young as a few months old and seperating children from their parents in spite of the lifelong trauma a child will experience being seperated from their parents at a young age. And this week Trump has gone further, outright asking foreign governments to open investigations into his political rivals and Fox News is continuing to support these treasonous actions. Your company choosing to use my money to adverise and support such racist programs is an absolute disgrace.  \n\n\nYour company should be ashamed of itself advertising at a place like that. If you do not stop supporting Fox News with your ad dollars, I will no longer be staying at your hotels and I will tell everyone I know to do the same. Please convey this message to whoever it is in your company that decides to adverise to Fox News."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1570155031,"title":"The Mad King\u2019s Enablers: As Trump\u2019s demands grow ever more erratic, democracy rests on the willingness of bureaucrats to ignore the democratically elected chief executive.

In addition, because they support beliefs that are already held, left-leaning posts require less factual evidence to support them in order to receive an upvote.\n\n**Why is this a problem?**\n\nBecause it creates an abundance of left-leaning politically motivated posts that state a negative thing about Trump or a Republican but does not *necessarily* provide the facts behind it.\n\n**But why is that a problem?**\n\nIt is a problem because it (1) opens the door for misunderstanding about the truth, be it good or bad, (2) leads to left-leaning individuals who feel very strongly against Trump but are not *necessarily* adequately armed with the evidence to support their claims, and as a consequence (3) *limits our collective ability to provide the kind of facts and logic that would help independents or only slightly right-leaning individuals see the light regarding Trump.*\n\n**What could resolve the problem?**\n\nAs a simple first step, I\u2019d propose we simply try to contribute to our comments on political posts by adding facts to support (or not) the claim of the OP. Additionally, we upvote that information when we see it to help visibility. This would produce a more educated community. I fear that the current rhetoric focuses too much on just hating Trump and doesn\u2019t devote enough attention to outlining and organizing the objective reasons for doing so (I.e., statistics, facts, etc).\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nI\u2019m not trying to say I have a perfect read on the situation. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve observed this problem and would genuinely like it to be resolved. It would certainly help me to be more informed. I think it would help others too. If you disagree, please don\u2019t be rude about it. I\u2019m certainly happy to learn if I am wrong about this observation. If you attack me as a person I simply won\u2019t respond."},{"author":"fapputer","created_utc":1571074237,"title":"Do we want war now?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"EliteGamer1337","created_utc":1571075016,"title":"Bernie Sanders would raise corporate tax rate to 35%, ban buybacks","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"EliteGamer1337","created_utc":1571075599,"title":"How Bernie Sanders would give power to workers in their companies","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1571077954,"title":"Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg Reportedly Held Private Dinners With Lindsey Graham, Tucker Carlson and Other Conservative Pundits","num_comments":2,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"FalcaoHermanos","created_utc":1571078292,"title":"Kosovo to Khmeimim: The 20-year strategy Russia played to outflank Americ","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1571078755,"title":"Biden Takes On Trump With A Sweeping Ethics Plan, Amid Push Back Over Ukraine; Joe Biden unveiled an ethics plan on Monday that directly targets President Trump, accusing him of creating the \"most corrupt administration in modern history.\"","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1571079043,"title":"Biden Takes On Trump With A Sweeping Ethics Plan, Amid Push Back Over Ukraine; Joe Biden unveiled an ethics plan on Monday that directly targets President Trump, accusing him of creating the \"most corrupt administration in modern history.\"","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"adamd22","created_utc":1571079232,"title":"New Sanders plan on worker ownership\/corporate reform out, some points: Workers get 45% of seats on corporate boards, Corporations must put 20% of shares into worker-controlled fund, $500M 4 employee ownership bank, Sweeping antitrust plan","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"EliteGamer1337","created_utc":1571079339,"title":"Nancy Pelosi's drug pricing plan would save Medicare $345 billion: CBO","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"Imheretohelpeveryone","created_utc":1571080276,"title":"\"Berner's for Yang:\" Why Some Young Voters Back a New Democratic Outsider","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"EliteGamer1337","created_utc":1571080467,"title":"Mike Bloomberg signals he would run if Biden struggles against Warren","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"Mynameis__--__","created_utc":1571080632,"title":"Biden Supporters Used To Say Sanders Was Their Second Choice \u2014 Now They Say Warren","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"VernShel80","created_utc":1571081924,"title":"Elizabeth Warren says 2016 Democratic primary was rigged","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"njmaverick","created_utc":1571082167,"title":"The current Democratic House has been one of the most productive in history.

What we share is what makes us capable of more than other animals, building a common memory and purpose among multitudes without sacrificing individual autonomy.  Therefore, what we choose to communicate is critically important to who and what people are.\n\nOnce we establish this, it comes as no surprise that the political right obsessively uses the phrase \"virtue signal\" - an otherwise legitimate criticism of *shallow* communication - to essentially mean all expression related to or *embodying*... **virtue**.  In other words, virtue itself is \"virtue signaling.\"\n\nThe implication is as twisted as it is unsurprising from such people: They are saying virtue is not real, and any communication of morals that would wound their ego is some form of empty vanity on the part of *others*.  \n\nIt's part of a long, sad pattern of narcissism with them: Condemned for lying, they declare that truth is not real.  Condemned for malice from positions of power, they insist that compassion is for weaklings.  And condemned for the petty malice they practice in everyday life, they retreat to the rhetorical gambit of labeling it a fiction meant to capitalize on social approval.  \n\nGot that?  \n\n\"Please\" and \"Thank you\" = virtue signaling.\n\n\"I love you\" = virtue signaling.  \n\n\"I do\" in a marriage ceremony = virtue signaling.\n\n\"Love thy neighbor\" = virtue signaling.\n\n\"We the people\" = virtue signaling.\n\n\"I have a dream\" = virtue signaling.\n\n\"...one giant leap for mankind\" = virtue signaling.\n\nUsing the words \"good,\" \"right\" (except for directional or political wing), \"justice,\" \"decency,\" \"honor,\" \"integrity,\" \"compassion,\" \"empathy,\" or any other term for a morally desirable quality = virtue signaling, as is using their antonyms for the opposite.\n\nHave you ever done anything good?  Well then, you better hide the fact from right-wingers, because it will hurt their feelings by reminding them that they're bad people.  And, of course, because their ego is more important than the truth, it's incumbent on you to protect them from their own character flaws rather than on them to ever change.\n\nIf you run into them doing this, using the phrase \"virtue signaling\" to shout down morality, just remember this phrase and call it what it is: **Malice normalizing**.  They want to pretend their malignant hypocrisy is some sort of insightful commentary, when in fact they're just denying that virtue is real because they have none."},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1571406017,"title":"Mulvaney Says, Then Denies, That Trump Held Back Ukraine Aid as Quid Pro Quo, Sending Administration's Denial Strategy Into Disarray","num_comments":15,"description":""},{"author":"njmaverick","created_utc":1571407460,"title":"As I stood on the parade field at Fort Bragg, one retired four-star general, grabbed my arm, shook me and shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u201d","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"njmaverick","created_utc":1571407658,"title":"Wow. #Erdogan tells news conference the letter sent by @realDonaldTrump telling him not to be a \u2018tough guy\u2019 wasn\u2019t in line with diplomatic or political customs.

Because it can happen.","num_comments":3,"description":"If Trump and Pence are both impeached & convicted, Pelosi becomes President. And at the rate that public support for Trump\u2019s impeachment is increasing, Pelosi becoming POTUS is a much more distinct possibility. Allow me to explain.\n\n**1. How would Speaker Pelosi become POTUS?**\n\nPelosi is currently second in line for presidential succession by the Presidential Succession Act 1947, behind VP Mike Pence. If Trump is impeached & convicted, and removed from office, Pence would become POTUS. However, the 25th Amendment dictates that Pence would only be able to approve a new VP with \u201ca majority vote of both Houses of Congress\u201d, which the Democratic-majority House could easily block. If Pence was impeached & convicted as well, with no VP, Pelosi would become POTUS as she would have become first in line for presidential succession after Trump\u2019s removal from office.\n\n**2. But wouldn\u2019t the Republican-majority Senate prevent their conviction?**\n\nGiven growing public support for Trump\u2019s removal from office, the unity of Republican senators is increasingly in question. Although the GOP intends to keep Trump as POTUS, senators simply cannot afford to vote against Trump\u2019s conviction if their states support it, especially if they support it by a large margin. The same applies to Pence, who is intertwined with Trump in both Russia & Ukraine scandals. As public opinion in Republican senators\u2019 states grows in support of Trump\u2019s impeachment, the possibility of a Pelosi presidency becomes ever more likely.\n\n**3. Trump has escaped all of his past scandals. How could the Ukraine scandal possibly cause his conviction?**\n\nThe Ukraine scandal, unlike Russian interference in our 2016 elections, is much more clear-cut and dry. Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo in the Ukraine scandal has dramatically shifted views of Trump among both the public and Republican politicians, and the new developments resulting from the first and future whistleblowers will only worsen the situation. For the first time, support for Trump\u2019s impeachment exceeded 50% this week, and remains very close to it.^(1) Additionally, Trump has reached this milestone much faster than Nixon or Clinton,^(2) and prominent Republican John Kasich, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate and ex-Ohio Governor, has declared his support for impeachment.^(3) It appears that Trump\u2019s impeachment & conviction has become ever more likely in the coming days, and that his luck will only get worse as Republicans grow increasingly unsettled by such revelations.^(4)\n\n**4. Even if Trump was impeached & convicted, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a case for Pence.**\n\nThere certainly is. Pence has been involved as an accomplice in both the coordination with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as well as the Ukraine scandal,^(5) and could even be prosecuted for obstruction of justice for his current actions against Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings.^(6) Even though a memo exists in the DoJ saying POTUS cannot be indicted, impeachment proceedings by Congress against Pence would be independent of the DoJ and thus free to remove him via conviction. The impeachment & conviction of Trump would also negatively affect Pence\u2019s image, making his removal all the more likely.\n\n**5. Perhaps Pelosi could become president\u2026 but what would we do?**\n\n*Advocate for the impeachment & conviction of both Trump and Pence.* Their convictions would be a *de facto* vote for Pelosi, and if this was framed as an earlier opportunity for the American people to \u201celect\u201d a president, it could increase public support for Pelosi as well. It\u2019s clear that Trump has among the lowest approval ratings for any POTUS in the history of presidential approval ratings, and assuming Pence is tied in with Trump\u2019s image, a Pelosi presidency is conceivable. To make it a reality, we need to spread awareness of the possibility of a Pelosi presidency via the impeachment & conviction of Trump and Pence, and help turn the tide of public opinion towards a Pelosi presidency. I\u2019m setting up a \u201ccenter\u201d of operations in r\/PelosiForPresident, but anyone can help promote Pelosi anywhere. If we raise enough support, it can happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Citations:**\n\n1.

The GOP has been doing this for years,\n\nRemember Superstorm Sandy? It screwed up the coastal blue states. When blue states went to get help from the Feds, then controlled by the anti-public spending (unless it helped GOP voters) Tea Party, the aid got held up for a considerable amount of time because some backwoods hick Reps didn't believe FEMA was Constitutional.\n\nAt least, not believing FEMA was Constitutional was their \"official\" story. The REAL story was that the GOP wanted to punish states that didn't vote for them. Superstorm Sandy was the perfect opportunity. And Dems largely let them get away with that nonsense in the name of civility much to our detriment.\n\nAnd don't let the Never Trump conservatives fool ya. This has been the GOP MO regarding FEMA long before Trump. Most of the retired\/outgoing GOP Reps who are so \"concerned\" about Trump gleefully participated in this strategy of denying FEMA aid to blue states to immiserate Dem voters in disaster areas.\n\nAnd for all their whining about how FEMA is not in \"duh strick tex of duh Constatushun\" (spelling purely for mockery purposes), the GOP is always down to help red states who get screwed by mother nature while she wields a sandpaper dildo.\n\nTrust me, if Puerto Rico voted for conservatives, Trump\/GOP would have zero issues dispersing aid.\n\nAnd to be honest, Democrats are too nice about this. They need to nut up and fight dirty. Hold conservatives to their own standards and let the bodies hit the floor as they may.\n\nI'd pay literal money to hear a coastal Dem Rep tell a \"textualist\" Republican whose district got flattened by nature, \"Hey remember the time MY district was underwater but you said sending us FEMA aid was against your weird interpretation of the Constitution?

Russia owns most of the loans on Trump properties. If they were to call them in, he'd lose everything, and he couldn't handle that. Plus, the way certain people in the GOP (McConnell & Graham for example) did such a 180 on their opinion of Trump, it's clear that the Russian mob, which, BTW, owns almost ALL of the apartments in Trump Tower, has threatened them. Remember how Stormy Daniels said someone threatened her? Remember how we heard tapes of Cohen threatening people? Why on earth do we not know that these people are being threatened? Why can't we admit it to ourselves?\n\nIt makes me think that THIS is what they should be investigating, not the relatively small things they're investigating now. WHY is Trump hiding his tax returns? Because it shows how much money he owes to Russia, and then everyone would know exactly why he sucks up to Putin, although we already know it and just seem to be ignoring it.\n\nImpeachment is pointless. The GOP is not going to vote him out of office, because they're afraid not of the base, but of Russia! Legal avenues will not fix this, and Pence is worse than Trump. He's even weaker, and can be manipulated and threatened more easily.\n\nWe need to face the fact that unless something VERY DRASTIC happens, we will soon be under puppet rule by Putin. Hell, we already ARE. There really isn't much we can do about it other than start WWIII and attack Russia. \n\nWe just need to open our eyes and see this for what it really is."},{"author":"EliteGamer1337","created_utc":1572636544,"title":"The issue that Obama alums think could doom Elizabeth Warren","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Hill1727","created_utc":1572636619,"title":"We dressed at \u201cTrump\u2019s Border\u201d for our Halloween costume.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1572637088,"title":"Biden's campaign is in crisis in 2 crucial early-voting states, seriously jeopardizing his claim to the Democratic nomination","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"NightTrader0","created_utc":1572637785,"title":"Bernie Sanders outlines plans to legalise cannabis","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1572640509,"title":"If Republicans think Tim Morrison\u2019s testimony is good news for Trump, they\u2019re grasping at straws: Republicans are finding solace that Morrison said he didn't see anything illegal in Trump's call.

In the May 21 primaries, Bevin held off three opponents to win the Republican primary. He will face Attorney General Andy Beshear, who defeated two challengers in the Democratic primary. The latest poll from Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy has the two candidates in a dead heat.\n* [Mississippi](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2019_Mississippi_gubernatorial_election): Faced with an open seat due to current Gov. Phil Bryant\u2019s term limits, Democrats could potentially stage an upset in this historically Republican state. While Mississippi hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the role since 1999, the two state officials competing for the seat \u2014 Attorney General Jim Hood (D) and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R) \u2014 are within striking distance of one another. \n\n### Legislative Elections\n\n* [Virginia General Assembly](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Virginia_General_Assembly): Republicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins. Democrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.\n* Legislative elections will be held for both houses of the [Louisiana Legislature](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Louisiana_Legislature), the [Mississippi Legislature](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mississippi_Legislature), and the lower house of the [New Jersey Legislature](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Jersey_Legislature).  \n\n### Mayoral Elections\n\n* [San Francisco, CA](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2019_San_Francisco_mayoral_election): London Breed, the first African American woman the city has elected for mayor, is now running for a full term.\n* [South Bend, IN](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2019_South_Bend,_Indiana_mayoral_election): Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg won\u2019t be running for reelection but he\u2019s endorsed his former chief of staff James Mueller. Mueller is the favorite in a race against public school teacher and Republican candidate Sean Haas.\n* [Philadelphia, PA](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2019_Philadelphia_mayoral_election): Kenney is running on raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, maintain supervised injection sites and the city's soda tax, and ensure the city's compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Ciancaglini promises to end Philadelphia's status as a sanctuary city and to cancel plans to establish sites where people can legally inject heroin. No Republican has won a Philadelphia mayoral election since Bernard Samuel in 1947\n\n### Ballot Measures\n\n* [Washington State](https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/Washington_elections,_2019): The use of affirmative action in Washington state as it relates to government jobs and state universities has been barred since 1998, when voters approved a measure banning it. This year, voters will have the option to reinstate affirmative action.\n* [New York City, NY](https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/City_elections_in_New_York,_New_York_(2019)): A ballot initiative asks voters whether they\u2019d like to use ranked-choice voting in races such as the mayor\u2019s election and the city council race. If the initiative passes, it would bring ranked-choice voting to the most populous city in the country, a huge step for pro-ranked-choice reform efforts.\n\n### Further Reading and Resources\n\n* [**Ballotpedia: Find What's On Your Ballot**](https:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/Main_Page)\n* [Vox: 7 key races and ballot initiatives to watch in this November\u2019s elections](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/policy-and-politics\/2019\/11\/4\/20938936\/november-5-election-mississippi-kentucky-virginia-ranked-choice-voting)\n* [CNN: Key races to watch Tuesday in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/11\/04\/politics\/election-2019-key-races\/index.html)\n* [USA Today (YDR): Election Day 2019: What you need to know about races, polling places and more](https:\/\/www.ydr.com\/story\/news\/politics\/elections\/2019\/11\/04\/election-day-2019-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-races-polling-place-changes-and-more\/4077279002\/)\n* [WaPo: Governor\u2019s races in three states test whether every election now is about Trump](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/governors-races-in-three-states-test-whether-every-election-now-is-about-trump\/2019\/11\/03\/03ae129c-fdd9-11e9-8906-ab6b60de9124_story.html)"},{"author":"hornet7777","created_utc":1572909202,"title":"BTRTN: Can the Dems Really Win Three Red State Governorships Tomorrow?","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"therecordcorrected","created_utc":1572909668,"title":"\u2018Seven whistleblowers\u2019 -- And a story that \u2014 if true \u2014 could be deadly for Jared Kushner.

Are we going to do Stonehenge tomorrow? To the real question:\n\nWhere can I find out more about how a primary runoff would work? I'm curious with Biden polling at about 28% nationally and Warren at 21% and Sanders around 17%, it seems quite possible that no one would get 50% if all three candidates are running on the day primary votes are cast (numbers are from 538). Firstly, it seems apparent to me that the Sanders\/Warren similarity in views makes it likely that if one were to step out the other would immediately jump ahead of Biden in polling. I'm just speculating, but I feel pretty confident in that assertion (just like Hilary was a lock to win ;) - ). \n\nSo how does a runoff work in this scenario?

I\u2019d rather not get into a fight about that here, but I should mention I\u2019m not a Klobuchar supporter and haven\u2019t followed her campaign too closely. \n\nBut I have noticed in debates she likes to talk about being a prosecutor in Minnesota. I can only assume it\u2019s to come off as relatable to voters. It\u2019s a popular strategy right now, possibly because it worked for that guy who tweets a lot. But it\u2019s exactly what everyone else is doing. \n\nKlobuchar\u2019s unique strength is that she\u2019s had 13 years in the Senate. Harris hasn\u2019t finished her first term, Booker has had one (Klobuchar is beating him already), Buttigieg and Castro are mayors, Yang is a businessman, and Gabbard and O\u2019Rourke are short-tenured Representatives. The only other candidates with comparable experience are *the top three.* Democrats don\u2019t like inexperienced populists right now\u2014who can blame them? \n\nAnd the top three though they are, they still consistently miss out on a third of voters. Biden\u2019s history of somewhat authoritarian policymaking obviously turns off a good fraction of the electorate. And while Warren and Sanders have a strong following, their combined poll numbers never cross 50%. It seems like Democrats haven\u2019t (yet) warmed to their rather ambitious agendas. \n\nIf Klobuchar wants to appeal to Democrats, she needs to talk about being a Senator. She needs to be openly more experienced than the field. It\u2019s her chance to stand out."},{"author":"DoremusJessup","created_utc":1573703835,"title":"Republicans discuss a longer Senate impeachment trial to scramble Democratic primaries","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Gumwall_Art_Critic","created_utc":1573704201,"title":"The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur files to run for Katie Hill's House seat","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"AndrewLucksRazor","created_utc":1573705548,"title":"CNN lawyer: it\u2019s a problem not one witness had contact with president.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"savage-burr1ro","created_utc":1573706342,"title":"Need further explanation on impeachment","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"worldgoes","created_utc":1573707901,"title":"Nobody could have predicated that impeachment hearings would be covered this way.

I don't know if this is a good place to post this, but I don't know of a better place, so here goes.\n\nEveryone that is biologically related to me are Christian, conservative, and Republican (and practically worship Trump). So, they have hateful and closed-minded views, like gay marriage is wrong, transgenderism is a mental illness, LGBT+ people are mentally ill, abortion is murder and people who get pregnant should always be forced to stay pregnant whether they like it or not, Mexicans are taking all our jobs and are all rapists and should be treated poorly, discrimination is okay, Liberals\/Democrats are mentally unstable and delusional, etc. On the other hand, I am an atheist, liberal, and Democrat. Ironically, I am \"out of the closet\" about that those things to everyone everywhere, except my biological relatives. I am probably never going to tell them I am atheist, liberal, Democrat, bisexual, etc., because they probably would never accept me, or maybe even try to hurt\/disown me.\n\nAlso, is it okay to not respect hateful views? Because my relatives demand that Democrats and Liberals respect their views, but, ironically, my relatives don't seem to respect the Liberals'\/Democrats' views.\n\n(Also, I may ask more questions like this in the future, if this is an okay place to do so; I am young and still trying to find my place in politics and the world in general)."},{"author":"Blinkyqaz","created_utc":1574651174,"title":"Buttigieg Vs.

Here is what I know from these and some other sources:\n\n- Putin secretively spoke with Trump while on the trip to Afghanistan, which is on the eve of the NATO summit in London. He was able to do so there without violating government rules on disclosure, since they are enforceable only within the US. In the past, this limitation has allowed Trump to tear up translators' notes after a conference with Putin, without risk of enforceable subpoenas from Congress.\n\n- Putin has been doing Trump a tremendous service in helping him overcome the impeachment actions, particularly by pushing the lie about Ukrainian interference, and funding Republican campaigns in Congress with the deal that they would parrot these lies during the impeachment hearings. Russia has also bought out the Senate already.  All that is even more valuable than Russian assistance with the 2016 election. Trump understands the commensurate expectations, and the support could unravel on Putin's whim.\n\n- Trump plans to secure Putin's intent to assist him with the 2020 election, since to stay in office gives Trump immunity from Federal prosecution. In fact, he is relying squarely on Putin for that. He is therefore going to complete withdrawal from Syria by Christmas this year and turn his back on the region so that Putin can get his leverage over both Turkey and Syria.\n\n- Trump does not care about Ukraine and has promised Putin no real opposition if Russia attempts to annex the country completely.  NATO agreements must be out of effect if that is to work. Russia has plans to complete the takeover of Ukraine by the end of 2021.\n\n- Trump is very concerned that Putin will have no reason to keep the 'komprimat' suppressed once he is reelected, when his need for Putin will diminish.  Trump will have to play ball and give Putin his ultimate prize, which is a full NATO withdrawal while Congress is in recess after the election.\n\n- Trump also plans to stop enforcing the Magnitsky Act in his second term, which will restore Putin's access to billions in personal wealth. Putin can then use this money to directly help Trump, both during and after his Presidency.\n\n- To the last point, Trump is open to asylum for himself and his family in Russia, if there's no more that can be done.  He might do so by putting on a state visit to Russia, with his family at his side, and then resign from office while there.\n\nSee below.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/11\/27\/politics\/trump-nato-contribution-nato\/index.html\n\nhttps:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/donald-trump-nato-funding-cut-early-christmas-present-vladimir-putin-russia-academic-1474638"},{"author":"Redbird1138","created_utc":1575057764,"title":"Ohio bill orders doctors to \u2018reimplant ectopic pregnancy\u2019 or face \u2018abortion murder\u2019 charges","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"Cezh_work_GSD_Scout","created_utc":1575058465,"title":"ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ CALLS OUT PETE BUTTIGIEG FOR 'SAD' ARGUMENT AGAINST FREE COLLEGE FOR ALL IN CAMPAIGN AD","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1575059447,"title":"Democrats set December 6 deadline for White House to say if it will participate in impeachment proceedings","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"smkperson","created_utc":1575059531,"title":"Shitty musician goes on racist tirade before being escorted off stage by his security guards","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1575064674,"title":"Medicare For All | Bernie Sanders 2020","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1575065272,"title":"Medicare For All | Bernie Sanders 2020","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"justanothersubreddet","created_utc":1575069724,"title":"Trump for 2020.

Such \"selecting\" is basically cherry picking. I strongly urge people to meditate long, hard and continuously on the basic idea of cherry picking. Along the lines of the cause of meditation\/thought, these observations occurred to me recently:\n\n1. The senatorial system is as case of cherry picking. Accepting it, that is. By accepting the rules that govern how many senators there are per state, the outcome (2 per state) is a kind of cherry picked outcome. The challenge here is to grasp just how this is a case of cherry picking. This is most important because in as much as the senatorial system is a continuous, structural condition of US democracy, it serves to acclimate people to the basic logic and conditions of cherry picking. In particular, it fosters and enforces a tolerance of cherry picking, even simply as a sheer ability to \"get over it\" when one notes that, \"gee, that doesn't seem like fair representation given the populations of South Dakota compared to California\". This obviously goes for the Electoral College, and then there's Gerrymandering...\n2. This comes from somewhere else altogether: basket ball games. Two teams battle it out, and wind if with the final score: 91 to 90. First, of course, it's important to grasp just how this is a case of cherry picking (I would suggest it is). Then there's the whole \"forced acclimation\" (\"hey, that's how the game is set up, accept the winner\/loser situation as part of the system\"). This causes people to simply get over the natural tendency to point out that you can't have a simple \"winner take all\" glory of victory when the score is that high and that close.\n\nI'm posting this here as the chief operation of Republicans is cherry picking."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1575298799,"title":"Help us with our High School Research Project.

What was an issue though, was her poll numbers, they were absolutely horrible for someone who had so much momentum.

What\u2019s Pete currently struggling with though in his campaign to beat Biden, the back vote.

Does anyone else think this will happen, or do you think this seems outlandish by some evidence I may have missed.\n\nTLDR: Kamala dropped out to give Pete a running mate to sway black voters away from Biden because they both see him as a large opponent, do you think this will happen as well?"},{"author":"thrwawyubot","created_utc":1575406266,"title":"I think people (Democrats) care too much about the candidates\u2019 races and gender when considering who to vote for.","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"dolphins3","created_utc":1575407248,"title":"Hillary Clinton: To all the candidates, staff, and volunteers who have worked their hearts out for presidential campaigns that have ended\u2014remember that fighting for what you believe in is always worth it.","num_comments":68,"description":""},{"author":"EliteGamer1337","created_utc":1575408338,"title":"Kamala Harris Drops Out of 2020 Presidential Race","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"JLBesq1981","created_utc":1575411352,"title":"GOP Rep.

I dislike Trump just as much as the next sane person, but the attitude of the Republicans treating this term as more of a sports game, and less of a country working together has stressed me out a bit.  It feels like it's less about the country's best interests in their eyes at this point, and more about \"winning\" against the Democrats, or whatever their definition of that seems to be at this point.  I mean, they're trying to take away food stamps, social security, medicare, and planned parenthood just to make up the deficits they've created from giving tax cuts to corporations and wall street, and that seems pretty backwater to me...\n\nWhile it's great to hear that the Democrats are working to get Trump removed from office, why are they only (at least at surface level) only focusing on the Ukraine incident?  We have clear other violations of the constitution that have been done, such as violating the Emoluments Clause, Obstruction of Justice, Witness Tampering, Witness Intimidation, Campaign Finance Violations, and those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.  It makes me pretty furious to hear that Trump has used $115 million of taxpayer money to go golfing at his OWN GOLF resorts while in office, and even more upset to hear that, according to public record, he's spent more time vacationing than being the President of the United States.\n\nI feel like it's going to be almost impossible given the attitude of the Republicans to get him on convicted or removed in the Senate on only the Ukraine incident.  Has there been any additional information about other sections of the Constitution that Trump has violated while holding office?  Have the Democrats leading the Impeachment Committee signaled that there's more than the Ukraine incident being used as a basis for impeachment?  It seems almost surreal that Clinton was removed for lying about having a consensual sexual relationship with a staffer, but Trump lying nonstop about large issues that effect the economy, violating the constitution on multiple accounts, and blatant abuses of power somehow is being washed over by the Republicans.\n\nIt just feels like they need more convincing, which is pretty hard to believe at this point...."},{"author":"KevinSpaceys_BigToe","created_utc":1575744490,"title":"I don\u2019t buy this anti tobacco stuff... do cigarettes really cause cancer?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Privacy_74","created_utc":1575745174,"title":"Speaker Pelosi Says Trump\u2019s Impeachment Is All About Russia","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Electronic_Nail","created_utc":1575747498,"title":"Trump?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1575750114,"title":"Katie Hill: It\u2019s Not Over After All","num_comments":6,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Im_tired_but_warm","created_utc":1575751232,"title":"Hey \ud83d\udc4b confused youngin here, why does the latest Harris poll only add up to 73%?

By no means am I trying to be an expert, but simply posing the following question: At what point do we draw the line in the sand between racial discrimination, and profiling based on quantitative data? \n\nYes, SQF - Stop, Question and Frisk, otherwise known as Stop-and-Frisk, or the law that the rich 'ol, white billionaire put in place while he was a Republican Mayor of New York City (yes, Mike Bloomberg).  \n\nWhen analyzing the data reported by NYC Open Data ([https:\/\/data.cityofnewyork.us\/Public-Safety\/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-\/833y-fsy8](https:\/\/data.cityofnewyork.us\/Public-Safety\/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-\/833y-fsy8)), there are a total of 20,659 shooting incidents, of which 12,028 have the reported perpetrator racial profile. Of those 12,028 (or, roughly 60% of the total data), Blacks account for 74% of total incidents; White Hispanics account for 15%; and Black Hispanics account for 9%. This results in 98% of the 12,028 reported incidents being Black or Hispanic with remaining 2% comprised of White, Asian\/Pacific Islanders or American Indian\/Alaskan Whites. \n\nBeing that 98% of shooting incidents were accounted for by Blacks and Hispanics, how does one decide that \"fitting a relevant description\" is racially discriminatory? I mean, what exactly defines \"fitting a relevant description\" in the first place? If I lived in Brooklyn, and 97% of all shooting incidents in my borough was accounted for by Blacks and Hispanics, I think the NYPD could classify a Black and Hispanic as fitting the racial profile.\n\nI think Mike Bloomberg is getting more heat than necessary, and people shouldn't be so focused on SQF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, when it comes to Booker's comment on being \"taken aback\" by the \"well-spoken\" comment. Give me a break. Booker is obviously articulate and well-spoken, and what's wrong with Bloomberg acknowledging that? I know white people that wouldn't be worthy of the compliment well-spoken, and I know black people that aren't worthy of the same.

Here's what you should do. First, get in power in the House, Senate and Presidency. Then, admit Puerto Rico, DC, Guam and other territories into the Union. Split up California, their legislature will allow it as it is completely democratic. Get rid of the filibuster. Stop gerrymandering. Make the Senate a fair represenation of the US population.

I'm pretty sure that's how he put it saying that Warrens plan creates ghettos. Well...\n\nHere in Dubuque, IA a person can pay $500\/month and live okay (I pay even less but it's kind of a shithole). So at $6000\/year in rent paid you'd have to make less than $18,000\/year to qualify for this. And I haven't done the math on what you'd be paying in income taxes (to be forgiven by Cory) if you make less than 18,000\/year but it's nowhere near $6000. It's basically nothing. This plan seems toothless.\n\nAlso the section 8 housing program, not very unlike Cory's plan, that we have in place here in town, given the limitations of infrastructure and the machinations of government, creates ghettos and gentrification anyway.\n\nAlso this idea creates a lot of arbitrary cutoff points. The logic of not having a cutoff is not strange to your friend Andrew Yang; ask him to explain to you how not to create a *benefit cliff*\n\n\n  This is important because rent is the largest line item cost for America's poorest people.

You know, Yangify it, just a hair. Then you can have the best of Yang logic without the free-for-all he's proposing.

The story of Moscow Mitch.","num_comments":5,"description":"**Campaign finance reports show troubling connections between a group of wealthy donors with ties to Russia and their political contributions to Trump and top Republican leaders.**\n\n *This column originally published December 15, 2017* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team probes deeper into potential collusion between Trump officials and representatives of the Russian government, investigators\u00a0are taking a closer look at political contributions made by U.S. citizens with close ties to Russia.\n\nBuried in the campaign finance reports available to the public are some troubling connections between a group of wealthy donors with ties to Russia and their political contributions to President Donald Trump and a number of top Republican leaders. And thanks to changes in campaign finance laws, the political contributions are legal. We have allowed our campaign finance laws to become a strategic threat to our country.\n\n..snip..\n\nData from the Federal Election Commission show that \\[Len\\] Blavatnik's campaign contributions dating back to 2009-10 were fairly balanced across party lines and relatively modest for a billionaire. During that season he contributed $53,400. His contributions increased to $135,552 in 2011-12 and to $273,600 in 2013-14, still bipartisan.\n\nIn 2015-16, everything changed. Blavatnik's political contributions soared and made a hard right turn as he pumped $6.35 million into GOP political action committees, with millions of dollars going to top Republican leaders including Sens. Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham.\n\nIn 2017, donations continued, with $41,000 going to both Republican and Democrat candidates, along with $1 million to McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund.\n\n.. long snip, detailed connections between Russian Oligarchs and American business leaders..\n\nWhy did GOP PACs\u00a0and other Trump-controlled funds take their money? Why didn't the PACs\u00a0say, \"Thanks, but no thanks,\" like the Republicans said to Shustorovich\u00a0in 2000? Yes, it was legal to accept their donations, but it was incredibly poor judgment.\n\nMcConnell surely knew as a participant in high level intelligence briefings in 2016 that our electoral process was under attack by the Russians. Two weeks after the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement in October 2016 that the Russian government had directed the effort to interfere in our electoral process, McConnell's PAC accepted a $1 million donation from Blavatnik's AI-Altep Holdings. The PAC took another $1 million from Blavatnik's AI-Altep Holdings on March 30, 2017, just 10 days after former FBI Director James Comey publicly testified before the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's interference in the election.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n..much more at link..\n\n [https:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/opinion\/commentary\/2018\/05\/08\/how-putin-s-oligarchs-funneled-millions-into-gop-campaigns\/](https:\/\/www.dallasnews.com\/opinion\/commentary\/2018\/05\/08\/how-putin-s-oligarchs-funneled-millions-into-gop-campaigns\/)"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1576426292,"title":"WHAT DO DEMOCRATS IN SUPER TUESDAY STATES WANT?

I searched further and found this article from [NPR](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2019\/12\/13\/787963186\/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-trump-subpoena-cases) about the SCOTUS decision to hear three lower court rulings:\n\n>First, there's a subpoena for Trump's longtime accountants, Mazars USA, issued by a grand jury in New York investigating alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and other women during the 2016 presidential campaign.  \n>  \n>Mazars USA has not objected to providing the material, but Trump sued to block his accountants from complying with the subpoena.  \n>  \n>The second case involves a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee that was looking into whether there is a need to enact legislation compelling all presidents in the future to make public their tax returns. In addition, the committee is seeking to close what it considers other ethical loopholes in the law with regard to a president's business activities.  \n>  \n>Trump is the only president in the modern era to have refused to make public his tax returns. For nearly a half century it has been standard for presidents to release their tax returns.  \n>  \n>The third case involves two banks that did extensive business with Trump, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, including providing him loans during his repeated bankruptcies.

I appreciate hearing from you.\n\nOn September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced that she was beginning an impeachment inquiry of President Trump. She made this announcement in response to media reports that a government whistleblower had alleged the President abused the power of his office for personal gain. These reports claimed that during a phone call with Ukraine's president in July 2019, President Trump threatened to withhold U.S. military assistance to Ukraine unless its government investigated possible corruption involving Vice President Joe Biden's son.\n\nSince Speaker Pelosi made her announcement, the White House has publicly released both the whistleblower's complaint and the transcript of President Trump's July 25th phone call with the Ukrainian president. The U.S. Department of Justice has also disclosed that it reviewed and concluded that the phone call was not a violation of federal campaign finance laws.\n\n**While President Trump exercised poor judgment in suggesting that foreign countries investigate Vice President Biden, nothing I have seen thus far rises to the level of removing him from office.** Media outlets have also reported that the military assistance to Ukraine that the President allegedly threatened to withhold was, in fact, disbursed. The United States has provided around $1.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, which I have consistently supported.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution provides that the president is removable from office \"on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Impeachment proceedings must originate in the House of Representatives, with a majority voting to impeach the president. If this occurs, the U.S. Senate holds a trial, and can only convict with a vote of two-thirds of members present.\n\nThere is a very high bar that should be met to nullify the results of an election and remove a sitting president from office. It has never happened in the course of American history. Because impeachment is a grave matter, it has traditionally been conducted in a transparent and fair manner. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats broke with that bipartisan precedent. They refused to hold a full House vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry for six weeks, conducted witness interviews in secret behind closed doors, and denied President Trump the basic due process rights afforded to past presidents.  \n\n\nAfter weeks of delay, on October 31, 2019, Speaker Pelosi finally held a full House vote on an impeachment resolution. This resolution passed on purely partisan lines without any support from House Republicans. In contrast, the House resolutions authorizing impeachment inquiries of Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon both received bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the House Democrats' resolution also lacked adequate fairness for the President. Given the gravity of an impeachment inquiry, House Democrats should have given President Trump the due process rights afforded to past presidents.\n\nOn December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives passed two articles of impeachment (H. Res. 755) against President Trump without any support from House Republicans. Upon receipt of these articles, the Senate will hold a trial. It is my hope that the process in the Senate will be fair, unlike the process in the House. In a Senate trial, House impeachment managers should be permitted to make their case, and the President's lawyers should be able to make their defense. At the conclusion of these presentations, the Senate can then decide what further steps may be necessary. Please be assured I understand your views on this matter, and will keep them in mind as the impeachment process continues.\n\nThank you again for your correspondence. Do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPat Toomey  \nU.S. Senator, Pennsylvania"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1576872689,"title":"I live in Milwaukee, how do I get involved in the DNC?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"SewenNewes","created_utc":1576873596,"title":"Bernie Sanders won December debate according to one focus group.
