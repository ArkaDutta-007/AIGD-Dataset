Mile after mile were dozens and dozens and dozens of shiny brand new bulldozers, excavators, backhoes, rollers. Having just bought a brand new front end loader myself at a fraction of the cost of these pieces of equipment, I knew what I was looking at. I\u2019ve driven past hundreds of construction sites before and what I usually see is compilations of equipment ranging from old to slightly new to brand new. NEVER all new. Then, BAM, it hit me.

Few other drivers driving past those dollars doesn\u2019t see what I saw, and come to that conclusion, illustrating how pathetic the Democratic Party is at touting the accomplishments of Biden\u2019s signature bill that strives to improve the lives of all of us.\n\nI wondered \u201cWHY AREN\u2019T THERE HUGE SIGNS IN FRONT OF EVERY BUILD BACK BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS promoting just how hard Biden and the democrats are working for all  Americans???\n\nThis total lack of self-promotion awareness in addition to the Democrat\u2019s inability to advertise the economic gains achieved lately is incomprehensible to me at a time when traitor Trump\u2019s poll numbers are climbing and Biden\u2019s are falling is baffling. If trump wins in 2024, it will be, in part, due to the help the Democratic Party gave him by keeping silent about its accomplishments, a trait that seems to be a constant from year to year to year."},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1704716500,"title":"Donald Trump didn\u2019t sign loyalty oath for Illinois ballot that pledges not to \u2018advocate the overthrow of the government\u2019","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1704716806,"title":"Esper dubs Trump a \u2018threat to democracy\u2019 on Capitol riot anniversary","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Gibran_02","created_utc":1704717968,"title":"I need the \"Party of Science\" to explain why conservatives are better parents.","num_comments":24,"description":""},{"author":"RyzenX231","created_utc":1704721244,"title":"Fetterman Rips His Alma Mater, Says Harvard Was \u2018Always a Little Pinko\u2019 But Now He Doesn\u2019t Even \u2018Recognize It\u2019","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"RyzenX231","created_utc":1704721661,"title":"Fetterman Rips His Alma Mater, Says Harvard Was \u2018Always a Little Pinko\u2019 But Now He Doesn\u2019t Even \u2018Recognize It\u2019","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1704723490,"title":"Trump retweets video declaring 'the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat'","num_comments":53,"description":""},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1704724247,"title":"Opinion | Trump just promised an authoritarian \u2018task force\u2019 to impose Christian ideology","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"hereforinfoyo","created_utc":1704729142,"title":"The Youth Vote in the U.S.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"47389266489","created_utc":1704731664,"title":"Biden admin to announce independent contractor rule that could upend gig economy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"47389266489","created_utc":1704731668,"title":"Biden admin to announce independent contractor rule that could upend gig economy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"TakeATrumpOnMe","created_utc":1704732706,"title":"From the Diary of Donald Jesus Trump: January 8, 2024","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Bubbly_Progress7957","created_utc":1704734069,"title":"LIVE Democratic Primary Debate: Marianne Williamson vs. Dean Phillips fr...","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"TroyMcClure10","created_utc":1704737661,"title":"Epstein accuser claims pedophile had sex tapes of Trump, Clinton, Prince Andrew and Richard Branson: new docs","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"flaskman","created_utc":1704738685,"title":"TL;DR because she affiliates herself with people who think Medicare for all is \u201csocialism\u201d and this is what THEY ALL DO when they get sick and can\u2019t afford it.","num_comments":56,"description":""},{"author":"littleoldlady71","created_utc":1704739319,"title":"Wayne LaPierre Nopes Out As NRA Reaches The Find Out","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1704742924,"title":"Multiple state Republican parties are going broke","num_comments":171,"description":""},{"author":"The_Last_patriot2500","created_utc":1704743817,"title":"Trump Is Connecting With a Different Type of Evangelical Voter","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"The_Last_patriot2500","created_utc":1704743892,"title":"Trump Is Connecting With a Different Type of Evangelical Voter","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"PoliticalPine","created_utc":1704746594,"title":"Best place to donate to keep Trump out of office and Biden In?","num_comments":6,"description":"Plain and simple, I believe Trump is a danger to our democracy and I want to donate money where it is best served in preventing him from getting re-elected, what is the best organization?

It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another.\u201d - Nelson Mandela \n\nProposed House Study Bill 542 aims to significantly cut services provided by Area Education Agencies, a decision that could have devastating consequences for our public education in Iowa.\n\nThe range of services facing cuts under this bill is extensive and critical. They encompass essential supports for students, including academic and social\/emotional\/behavioral assistance; invaluable resources for schools like classroom book sets, coaching, consultation, and library & digital resources; crucial supports for school districts such as cybersecurity and emergency response; and indispensable services for educators including training programs and curriculum support. \n\nThese services form the backbone of our public education system in Iowa. Their elimination would be nothing short of catastrophic for the state\u2019s education, undermining the very foundation of our community's learning environment.\n\nThe removal of these services would not only diminish the quality of education but also place an undue burden on our teachers, schools, and districts. The strength of our public education system lies in its ability to offer comprehensive support to ALL students, educators, and families. By undermining this system, House Study Bill 542 risks the future of public education in our state.\n\nI urge each one of you to take a moment to contact your state representative. Express your concerns about House Study Bill 542 and the detrimental effects it will have on our education system."},{"author":"No_Scallion2151","created_utc":1705162130,"title":"This Never Happened At A Democrats Rally","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"No_Scallion2151","created_utc":1705162324,"title":"Black Americans have HAD IT with Kamala Harris \ud83d\ude24","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"No_Scallion2151","created_utc":1705163184,"title":"Rob Schneider makes fun of mask freaks \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Narches","created_utc":1705164813,"title":"What does r\/democrats think of a land value tax?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"politicalthrow99","created_utc":1705168854,"title":"There Is No \u201cBoth Sides\u201d to Donald Trump\u2019s Threat to Democracy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Kunphen","created_utc":1705171887,"title":"Dictionaries a casualty of right-wing book ban panic","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Bigchip4-Returns","created_utc":1705172484,"title":"Ladies and gentlemen, we got them:","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"HeinieKaboobler","created_utc":1705172823,"title":"2020 election error in Prince William County benefited Trump, officials reveal","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1705174208,"title":"Johnson stands by spending deal amid far-right opposition push.

Guilfoyle to me is a MAJOR liability for Newsom who casts a dark shadow over him from my vantage point for a few reasons:\n\n1. Newsom speaks exceptionally well and when he speaks his views sound genuinely progressive, as one might expect from the governor of California. On the other hand, California elected Republicans Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and with Newsom's Hollywood\/game show host looks of perpetual tans, big white teeth and nary a hair out of place, I already wonder how much of his presentation is showmanship. While he sounds authentic, he's at least as much about appearances\u2014and this infamous photo of him and Kim sprawled out like tycoons in a gaudily opulent Trump Tower-type penthouse screams that he envisions himself as a one-percenter whether or not he holds that much money, and that is antithetical to the progressive ideals he reaches.\n\n2. Speaking of Trump, this is the glaring one. Not only did Guilfoyle work as one of Fox News's disinformation agents, but she went on to partner with Donald Trump, Jr. who in many regards is the mirror reverse of Gavin Newsom, as a gawky, bumbling, frenetic fraud whose life is conscripted to serving his dictator father. And not only did Guilfoyle hitch her personal wagon to Trump, but she also is in a parasitic relationship with the Trump family, milking their notoriety for public speaking fees and book deals, and she gave an unforgettable unhinged fire-and-brimstone speech on Dad Trump's behalf and memorably celebrated Insurrection Day by dancing and singing \"Gloria\" on video. What does this have to do with Newsom? Ostensibly nothing, but the problem is that Guilfoyle's words and actions 100% contradict every one of Newsom's purported ideals. How can that be possible when they were married for four years? And to the point above, Newsom's photo shoot and public image as new ostentatiously opulent political royalty is more in line with Guilfoyle's current public image, and as much as I like what I hear from Newsom, all of this makes me feel like I can't trust what I hear. He is polished enough to be slick with the presentation, again, of a game show host or a high-end salesman, and...well, so was Donald Trump when he was younger. Donald Trump once spoke of pretty progressive beliefs and then he took an insane sharp turn to the farthest right possible. As did Gavin Newsom's wife. Taken together, I can't shake an uneasy feeling when I see and hear Newsom today.\n\nIt's likely that Newsom will be a Democratic party candidate for POTUS (if we retain a democracy following the next election), and in order not to get a huge ick and uneasiness from him, I really need him to explain in terms that make sense what he and Kim Guilfoyle ever had in common, why he engaged with her in selling themselves as flashy new-money millionaires who rubbed elbows with the elitest of the elite, and why I am supposed to believe that she is the one who changed.\n\nAll of this is prejudice, I know and I acknowledge. But public elected officials' character\u2014even given that all politicians necessarily compromise their integrity to sell themselves\u2014does matter in the end, and I know I am far from the only person who is creeped out by Newsom's past with Kim Guilfoyle. I really wish he would explain how in the hell both of them have supposedly changed from who they were when they were together. She opportunistically went fascist when she calculated that it would benefit her financially, and I have to wonder if that's the type of personal character trait that would have brought her together with all of her ambitious life partners, not just the current one."},{"author":"UnusualAir1","created_utc":1705754763,"title":"America's economic mood is improving fast: survey","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"crazypayne93","created_utc":1705756709,"title":"Greg Locke Gets Wrecked by GOD","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"egusa","created_utc":1705757061,"title":"Mexico\u2019s President downplays Trump\u2019s immigration claims following Iowa victory","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"AnotherBoxOfBees","created_utc":1705762112,"title":"Crossover Voting For The First Time","num_comments":2,"description":"This year for the primaries I have decided to engage in crossover voting for the first time to have a say in the republican candidate for president. I\u2019ve been hearing that this is a growing trend especially in places like New Hampshire that don\u2019t require a party change to to vote in either parties primary. NPR recently had a story about this and I was surprised to find out how easy it actually is to switch parties in most states ([this is the website I am basing that opinion on, it\u2019s called party switcher](https:\/\/www.partyswitcher.com\/).)\n\nWhat I want to know is do you think this is a real trend? Do you think it is a good idea? And are you doing it? \n\nI personally don\u2019t think there is anything ethically questionable about wanting to have a say about who might become president at any level of the process, and see crossover voting as having potential to push political discourse away from the outer edges of either party. I think the biggest criticism is the potential for crossover voters to have ill intent or be troll voting, but I think a lot of that concern is fed by internet culture and does not bear out in reality.\n\nAnyway! Really do want opinions here, this election matters a great deal, but i don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a major change to far right extremism in the near future and there is value in doing what we can to bring those who get elected back from the outer edges of the party. To me this is a better move than dismissing republicans entirely and stoking us vs them further."},{"author":"churros4burros","created_utc":1705766654,"title":"Early voting has begun in Virginia\u2019s presidential primaries","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"walkingviper33","created_utc":1705767281,"title":"What is victory for Joe Biden in New Hampshire?","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"swazal","created_utc":1705768550,"title":"He\u2019s going to need some votes for confidence","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"Free_Swimming","created_utc":1705768934,"title":"Obama told a story about America at his first inauguration 15 years ago.

Do we believe he can defeat ol\u201945? Will he have enough support to do this? Can we all agree to give him the support he needs? Or does this task require someone else?\n\nIf so, whom? We must all decide together, we must discuss this thoroughly within and among our communities, and the time for these discussions is now! (If you haven\u2019t already had them, of course! \ud83e\udd2d hehe\u2026)\u2026\n\nAnyway, so\u2026 *if* it\u2019s not Biden, then who is it going to be?\n\nLet\u2019s all lay aside our personal loyalties and aspirations for a moment and think for a moment, together\u2026\n\nNot necessarily about *policy*, per se, because we can all work on finding consensus on *that* later\u2026\n\nWhat I *mean* is, who are we all most confident can win this, for the good of all?\n\nNot just for the good of every democrat or the good of every American, no. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about the good of *the world*, of *future generations*\u2026\n\nWho can we entrust with our collective fate?\n\nThese are just a few of the people I can think of off the top of my head, four women who I believe are capable of the undertaking, should they accept the challenge. I believe there\u2019s a future presidency for each of them, *if* we can successfully defend our democracy against those who would destroy it\u2026\n\nHowever, let me not mince my words. Whoever accepts this challenge will be drawing a LARGE target on their own back\u2026 so let us not forget the sacrifice they willingly make when they either step forward on their own accord, or when they concede to serve in that capacity when asked to accept the duty of holding public office\u2026 so let us all overcome our egos and petty prejudices, and pledge instead our loyalties to *someone who can save us from domestic fascist incursions*!!! (((Holy God, I can\u2019t believe I actually have to say this)))\u2026\n\nUmmm so yeah, on second thought it isn\u2019t safe for me to post their names right now (don\u2019t worry ladies, I would *not* do that to you); but I think everyone here can prolly all work together to figure out who the right person is?\n\nI mean, do we *want* to let Biden take this one for the team? Are we confident he can succeed? If so, I say let the man proceed\u2026 he chose his administration wisely, and we must all commend him for that alone, nevermind his plethora of legislative *successes*\u2026; is it enough to secure him a second turn? Or must we nominate someone else for this task?\n\nWhat do you all think? How do you all feel about this?\n\nWe *must* have these discussions *now*, before the first flowers begin to bloom in springtime\u2026\n\nWe must decide, in unison, as a party, *who is going to take on trump*? And whoever we choose *must consent* to the task before we run them\u2026\n\nDo we understand? Does anybody not understand? Is there *anything else* that I can say or do to clarify what I mean by the words I\u2019ve used?\n\n\u2026(by the way, speaking of *the words I\u2019ve used*, I apologize if I\u2019ve caused any harm inadvertently, sometimes I\u2019m just ignorant until someone enlightens me)\u2026\n\nCan we do this, just this, together?\n\nThe fate of the balance of the world is quite literally resting upon the decisions we make together\u2026\n\nAre we ready to write these next few pages of history together? Because time is ticking, and if we choose *not* to decide, we still have made. a. choice!\n\nSquad up!\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udee1\u2757\ufe0f"},{"author":"Forward-Form9321","created_utc":1706059473,"title":"Anyone who says we should give Marianne Williamson or Dean Phillips a chance is bugging","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"papergabby","created_utc":1706060872,"title":"Biden wins New Hampshire primary, CNN projects, with successful write-in campaign","num_comments":35,"description":""},{"author":"Former-Food2277","created_utc":1706061054,"title":"'I keep meeting' two-time Trump voters who won't back him anymore: NBC News reporter","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Longjumping_Pin917","created_utc":1706061320,"title":"Primary","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Possible_Fennel2632","created_utc":1706061510,"title":"Former Trump Voter Tells CNN She Voted Haley Because She Doesn\u2019t Want Her Grandchildren Growing Up in a \u2018Dictatorship\u2019","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"TheJG_Rubiks64","created_utc":1706061567,"title":"Can someone explain this to me??","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Dependent_Yesterday9","created_utc":1706061672,"title":"Biden wins a New Hampshire write-in campaign","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"h20poIo","created_utc":1706062501,"title":"Comer again fails to incriminate Biden with new impeachment inquiry witness, the real witch hunt.","num_comments":9,"description":"If at first you don't succeed, fail, fail again and again."},{"author":"walkingviper33","created_utc":1706063232,"title":">85% of the processed write-ins are going to Biden","num_comments":38,"description":"One of the biggest concerns with the write-in campaign was that there\u2019d be issues with people filling out the ballots correctly.

Gerry Connolly\nWashington, February 14, 2023\n\n\nRepublicans are clamoring over themselves to blame President Joe Biden for any and every challenge facing America. Nowhere is that more apparent than on the issue of immigration and border security.\n\nIf you listen to my Republican colleagues, you\u2019d believe Joe Biden single-handedly broke our immigration system and refuses to fix it. They keep this lie alive by perpetuating a series of myths about Democrats and the border.\n\nIt\u2019s time to correct the record.\n\nMYTH: The Biden administration has implemented an \u201copen border\u201d policy that has created chaos at our border with Mexico.\n\nTRUTH: President Biden inherited an immigration system in tatters. The Trump administration cut off legal pathways to citizenship, leaving would-be migrants with fewer lawful methods of entering the country. They cut funding to Central American countries in 2019 as they splurged on an ineffective, costly wall.\n\nIt was the Trump administration that tightened sanctions on Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, exacerbating the macroeconomic crises that have led hundreds of thousands to flee and arrive at the southern border. When they pulled the rug out from various, essential assistance programs, they made the problem worse.\nBut our immigration system has been broken for many decades \u2014 long before Joe Biden or Donald Trump took the oath of office. Time and again, Democrats have proposed solutions to fix the immigration system in a reasonable, humane way. And time and again, Republicans have opposed these efforts at every turn.\n\nOne might recall that in 2013, House Republicans thwarted comprehensive immigration reform after an agreement was reached in the Senate. Many of those same House Republicans who prevented that legislation from passing are now intent on blaming irregular migration, an issue our country has dealt with for over a century, solely on the Biden administration.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem with their affinity for blaming Democrats \u2014 it doesn\u2019t hold up to basic scrutiny. In fact, between December 2022 and January 2023, the Biden-Harris administration halved the number of encounters at the border and reduced the number of Cuban, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan, and Haitian migrants by 97 percent.\n\nMYTH: The Biden administration has ignored the border and is refusing to commit proper resources to it.\n\nTRUTH: The idea that Democrats have ignored the situation at the border and refused to commit resources to solving it is another outright lie. In reality, the Biden-Harris administration and congressional Democrats have surged record levels of funding to the border.\n\nThe FY23 government funding package that President Biden signed into law provided Border Patrol with $7.153 billion \u2014 a 17 percent increase from the year before. Additionally, the funding package provided $65 million for 300 new Border Patrol agents, $60 million for 125 new personnel at points of entry; and $230 million for technology like autonomous surveillance towers.\n\nHouse Republicans voted against this historic funding.\n\nMYTH: Biden\u2019s \u201copen border\u201d policies allow undocumented immigrants to flood the country with deadly fentanyl.\n\nTRUTH: Republicans continue to blame vulnerable migrants fleeing violence, hunger, and natural disasters for illicit drug smuggling, but facts are stubborn things. Over 90 percent of fentanyl, and over 80 percent of total illegal narcotics, arrive at legal points of entry\u2014not between them\u2014and are smuggled largely by Americans\u2014not undocumented migrants. In fact, migrants accounted for less than 9 percent of fentanyl trafficking convictions in FY 21, compared to more than 86 percent for American citizens.\n\nIn December 2022, CBP seized 4,500 pounds of fentanyl, the largest amount ever recorded. Incredibly, just five of those 4,500 pounds were seized at the border by U.S. Border Patrol. Republicans are focused on 1 percent of the problem, 100 percent of the time.\n\nMYTH: Biden\u2019s \u201copen border\u201d policies have allowed criminals and terrorists to pour over the southern border unchecked, contributing to a spike in crime in America.\n\nTRUTH: Study after study has shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Alternatives to Detention Program provides a strong example: The latest data from ICE released on Feb. 3, 2023, demonstrated 99.4 percent of immigrants monitored on ICE\u2019s Alternatives to Detention Program attended their court hearings compared to the .6 percent which failed to attend their hearing.\n\nNot all undocumented immigrants are tracked through this program, but immigrants, when paroled into the United States, overwhelmingly are lawful individuals that attend their court hearings. An American Immigration Council report found that over the past 11 years, an overwhelming 83 percent of immigrants attended their immigration court hearings, and those who failed to appear in court often did not receive notice or faced hardship in getting to court.\n\nRepublicans who assert the Biden administration is releasing countless dangerous migrants into the country are not only trafficking in xenophobic, anti-immigrant sentiment, but they are also peddling lies that are categorically false.\n\nThe situation at the border demands serious policy solutions that provide a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients; address the root causes of migration like repression, political instability, violence, hunger, and lack of economic opportunity; and fix our own broken immigration system."},{"author":"Otherwise-Buy-439","created_utc":1706251203,"title":"Senate deal on border and Ukraine at risk of collapse as Trump calls it 'meaningless'","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"ProfessionalAerie441","created_utc":1706252875,"title":"Greg Abbott Invokes Texas' 'The Supreme Law of the Land' to Grant Soldiers Authority Over Biden - All Things Finance","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Otherwise-Bend-5347","created_utc":1706255244,"title":"Greg Abbott has new Supreme Court plan after justices side with Biden","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Pitiful-Fail723","created_utc":1706266240,"title":"Why President Trump is better than Joe Biden","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Character-Tomato-654","created_utc":1706272742,"title":"I am a Jew who owns a gay porn company, and I want you to come to Israel","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"1000000students","created_utc":1706278686,"title":"What Recession?

And while regulators haven\u2019t settled on that benchmark fee yet, amounts being considered range from a low of $3 to a high of $14.\n\nThe new overdraft regulations follow a rule proposed last year that aims to bring down credit card late fees, which the CFPB estimates cost Americans $12 billion each year. The rule, which could be finalized as soon as this month, could reduce those fees by $9 billion each year, the CFPB says. Under current regulations, a credit card company can charge $30 for a first late payment and $41 for subsequent ones, and up to 100% of the required payment, if it can prove the costs it incurs are higher than $41. But under the CFPB\u2019s proposal, the late fee could never be more than $8 or 25% of the required payment, if the credit card issuer proves that its costs exceed $8.\n\nThe agency also has released guidance for banks on what it calls \u201csurprise depositor fees\u201d and \u201csurprise overdraft fees,\u201d which they said may be illegal under the Consumer Financial Protection Act.\n\nIn November, the CFPB proposed a rule to apply the same banking safeguards it provides to banks \u2014 such as deposit insurance \u2014 to businesses like Venmo and Apple Pay that provide \u201cdigital wallets.\u201d Under the regulations, the agency would be able to monitor these companies to make sure consumers\u2019 rights to privacy and the transfer of money are being protected."},{"author":"Available-Amoeba-725","created_utc":1706400041,"title":"Nancy Mace Had A Plan To Get Punched By Jan. 6 Rioters' For Sympathy Votes: Report","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"SuperRun1672","created_utc":1706402054,"title":"Nancy Mace\u2019s Bizarre Jan. 6 Plan: \u2018Get Punched in the Face\u2019 For Sympathy Votes","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Commercial_Ice_6616","created_utc":1706402354,"title":"Penn Gillette","num_comments":4,"description":"Whoaaa, my respect for him just returned.

I think that what often gets interpreted as sexism is in fact a flagrant disregard for humanity in general, which is so unparalleled in American political history that we don\u2019t have the vocabulary to describe it. Sexism, we have a vocabulary for.\nMy scenario is actually a worse scenario. Sexism is endemic, but on an individual level it\u2019s curable: All it takes is for one decent person to recognize the error of their behaviors and the flaws in their thoughts, and to put a good-faith effort into changing course.\nWhatever Donald Trump is, it\u2019s not endemic. It\u2019s singular. It could only be changed if he wanted it to, and he\u2019s shown no indication that he wants to behave any way other than how he\u2019s already spent seven years behaving.\nTrump might pick a female running mate. Trump might have been found liable \u2014 again \u2014 for defamation in the Carroll trial. Neither act really says much about how he feels toward women. They say much more about what a deeply wounded megalomaniac thinks of himself\/herself, and what he\/she is willing to elevate or ruin to stay on top.\u201d"},{"author":"The_Last_patriot2500","created_utc":1706567734,"title":"Trump Is a Combination of Every Threat We Have Ever Faced in Our History","num_comments":44,"description":""},{"author":"Warm_Buy1130","created_utc":1706568089,"title":"Republicans unveil impeachment articles against head of homeland security | House of Representatives","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"cookies8424","created_utc":1706568820,"title":"Florida is at it again.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Real-Reputation6369","created_utc":1706569546,"title":"The GOP\u2019s Great Betrayal","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"EndZoneEnzio","created_utc":1706570103,"title":"president doofy reporting for dooty","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Btravelen","created_utc":1706570283,"title":"Ex-IRS contractor sentenced to 5 years in prison for leaking Trump tax records","num_comments":0,"description":"Pathetic.. the guy is a Patriot \nYet, Jan 6ers are getting probation.."},{"author":"Btravelen","created_utc":1706570377,"title":"Ex-IRS contractor sentenced to 5 years in prison for leaking Trump tax records","num_comments":0,"description":"Yet, Jan 6ers are getting probation"},{"author":"NeedleworkerLess3509","created_utc":1706571601,"title":"GOP Sen.

Similarly, Trump's official campaign blew through more cash than it took in over the last three months of the year. That suggests that Trump's recent threats to blackball Republican donors who don't give to him are about more than just loyalty: He also needs the money.\n\nBy comparison, Biden's campaign ended the year with $46 million in cash, far more than the $33 million Trump's campaign held before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. Future Forward, the main super PAC backing Biden, held a little bit more in the bank than MAGA Inc., $24 million to $23.3 million, at the end of the year.\n\nAs an advantage of incumbency, Biden has been able to coordinate fundraising with his national party throughout the campaign season. The Democratic National Committee recently reported that it had $21 million on hand at the start of this year, and big donors have been piling money into state Democratic Party accounts via the Biden campaign fundraising operation, too.\n\nBecause there is a primary campaign on the GOP side, Trump has not been able to use the Republican National Committee \u2014 which ended the year with $8 million in the bank \u2014 as an arm of his campaign in the same way. The RNC is officially neutral in the primary campaign, although party Chair Ronna McDaniel has recently called on the GOP to unite around Trump, whom she described as the \"eventual nominee.\""},{"author":"Typical80sKid","created_utc":1706792548,"title":"Why is this \u201cOpen Enrollment\u201d push in MO a bad thing?","num_comments":0,"description":"My first thought hearing about this was \u201coh good, kids in struggling areas can take advantage of the resources Rolf nicer areas\u201d.

In the Emerson poll taken in January for the South Carolina Democratic Primary, the poll results were as follows: \n\n\ud83d\udd39Biden: 69%\n\n\ud83d\udd39Phillips: 5%\n\n\ud83d\udd39Williamson: 3%\n\nThat polling was based on 320 Likely Voters. 320 Likely Democratic Voters. Obviously it\u2019s was completely off. \n\n\ud83d\udea8Similarly, others polls and the accompanying narratives based off of said polls were that President Biden was losing support (only based of poll numbers\u2014which *samples* likely voters or registered voters. Those voters are supposed to represent the population at large).\n\n\ud83d\udea8So why\u2014and hear me out\u2014is an *actual voting sample* of 126,000 people casting an actual ballot, being so casually dismissed as \u201cnothing\u201d when 96% of those people show up in favor of President Biden?  *126,000 actual voter is greater than and more reliable than 320 likely voters.*\n\n\ud83d\udea8If polling is just a snapshot of a few hundred or a few thousand people representing a population and it\u2019s really gauging likely or registered voters, isn\u2019t actual voting even more of an accurate indicator of what\u2019s really happening? (Answer: Yes). \n\n\ud83d\udea8The fact is, President Biden and the campaign isn\u2019t just relying on incumbency and isn\u2019t taking this primary for granted. They are on the ground earning votes. \n\n\ud83d\udea8He won New Hampshire with a write-in campaign and that was a bigger deal than he got credit for. He just won SC with 96% of the vote after months of a narrative about how he was losing support with the Black community - it didn\u2019t show up in the primary. \nOf course the media has pivoted to low approval ratings now because the economy is booming, SC was fantastic, and the GOP is shitting the bed on the border. \n\n\ud83d\udea8On the contrary, Trump\u2019s abysmal performance in Iowa and New Hampshire where he didn\u2019t really sweep like the almighty he claims is and he\u2019s STRUGGLING with Independents and Suburban women. What gives? \n\n\ud83d\udea8Lastly, President Biden didn\u2019t run unopposed, even if his opponents have no chance. Dean Phillips has been talking shit but not delivering anything and can\u2019t take the hint that it\u2019s not some DNC plot to shun him or box him out\u2014it\u2019s just that President Biden is a better choice and even if there *were* an alternative to entertain, Dean Phillips is actually not helping himself by insisting that *he* is the savior. Like, the Democratic bench is hella strong bro. Sitcho arrogant ass down, and support President Biden for 2024 and we can get some fresh blood on the next one. Now\u2019s not the time dude.

The White House asked Congress for an additional $6 billion to keep the program afloat through this year. The Federal Communications Commission, which administers the ACP, estimates it will run out of money in April, so the monthly subsidy would have to end for those 23 million households.\n\n\"Almost half of the households who participate are military households, roughly a quarter are African American, roughly a quarter are Latino and all of them are in dire need of making sure that they have a tool, high-speed internet, that enables them to get access to health care, enables their kids to go to school, enables them if they're small business owners to grow that business,\" said Perez.\n\nSome members of Congress are talking about ways to get more Americans affordable internet access, but some lawmakers have concerns about the ACP's management and who is benefiting from the monthly discount. And with Congress still working on major issues like immigration and the federal budget, it's unlikely that new funding for internet access will be approved in the next few months."},{"author":"ahubrisknowsnobound","created_utc":1707367051,"title":"HistoryRepeatsItself","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"AceCombat9519","created_utc":1707368431,"title":"\u2018Laughable\u2019: AOC blasts GOP\u2019s \u2018craven\u2019 bid to impeach DHS Secretary","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"AceCombat9519","created_utc":1707368476,"title":"Republicans \u2018absolutely allergic\u2019 to fixing border, says Sen.

This will make 2024 Nevada\u2019s most accessible election year for Native American voters yet.\n\nRepublican Gov.

It would also allow regulation if those rules would improve the health of the patient without infringing on their autonomy.\n\nMissourians for Constitutional Freedom officially launched its signature collection campaign this week with events across the state, including in Springfield, Kansas City and St. Louis. It is supported by Abortion Action Missouri, the ACLU of Missouri and Planned Parenthood affiliates in Kansas City and St. Louis.\n\nSince officially launching its campaign last month, the group has raised more than $4.4 million. Leaders of the group speculated that they would need at least $5 million to collect the necessary signatures.

Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.), locked in a tight race with Republican Mazi Pilip, who has sought to tie him to President Biden's policies, especially on immigration.\n\nPilip's campaign has centered its attacks on Suozzi around immigration, an apparent effort to tie him to Biden, whose policies on the issue have been rated poorly. Voters in the district say immigration is one of their most important issues.\n\nDemocrats still expressed optimism about Suozzi winning but recognized the race likely will be tight given the realities of the district.\n\nDemocratic strategist Gabe Tobias argued Democrats need to work to mobilize their voters to succeed in congressional races this year, focusing on issues like protecting abortion access and democracy in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade overturning and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Tobias, who served as a senior adviser to the progressive PAC Justice Democrats, argued Republicans are trying to set immigration as the defining issue of the race, but Democrats should not buy into that.\n\nOne Democratic strategist disagreed, arguing that doubling down on immigration not being a serious issue would cause a worse performance. They said Suozzi is pursuing the right strategy in navigating a difficult position on immigration, but if he loses, it'll be because national narratives are dominating the race.\n\nDemocratic strategist Tom Bonier said Suozzi needs to simultaneously improve Democratic turnout and persuade more independents than the party did in 2022 when Santos won. He said the signs appear promising for Suozzi so far based on an analysis of early voting and polls, but most people vote on election day.\n\nHe added that immigration and abortion likely will be the two issues most impacting voters' decisions. Democrats have sought to tie Pilip to Republican calls for a national abortion ban, despite Pilip having said she is opposed to abortion but would not support a ban.\n\n\"If nothing else, it's likely blunted the effectiveness of the issue. For me, this will be an interesting but a very early test of have Republicans lost what they, I believe, had hoped to be their most powerful issue in this election,\" Bonier said about Republicans shooting down the bipartisan border deal, referring to both the special election and the 2024 campaign."},{"author":"Free_Swimming","created_utc":1707679437,"title":"Black Churches in Georgia Unite to Mobilize Voters in a Key Battleground","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"Schmursday","created_utc":1707679737,"title":"Is Biden our best shot at winning?

The League of Women Voters of Georgia, NAACP Georgia and several other groups have since filed a lawsuit, alleging the law violates voter protections under the 14th and 15th amendments and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n\nThe churches, whose congregations lean Democratic, will have a budget between $200,000 and $500,000, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe Biden campaign also sent Vice President Harris on a tour of historically Black colleges and universities and aired ads on Black radio stations across the nation.\n\nOther faith-based organizations have also begun voter engagement campaigns. The Poor People\u2019s Campaign, a coalition first led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., announced last week a 30-state voter engagement campaign to begin next month. In December, the National Action Network and the Conference of National Black Churches also announced a new partnership for their own voter engagement campaign."},{"author":"GFYS2025","created_utc":1707772794,"title":"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s Anti-Cannabis Crusade","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"T_Shurt","created_utc":1707774653,"title":"Donald Trump Officially Files Petition for Writ of Certiorari Arguing That the Supreme Court Should Decide Whether Trump is Immune From Criminal Prosecution","num_comments":55,"description":""},{"author":"Hot_Buffalo7786","created_utc":1707776547,"title":"Billion-dollar ad campaign fueled by anti-LGBTQ+ forces returns to Super Bowl to promote Jesus","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"audiomuse1","created_utc":1707776712,"title":"Allred or Gutierrez: Which Democrat will face-off against Ted Cruz in Texas","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"Simple_Barry","created_utc":1707779635,"title":"Docs Obtained by TPM Show Trump Lawyers\u2019 Plan To Make Jan. 6 Last For Days On End","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1707780234,"title":"Virginia House Democrats force vote on controversial abortion bill","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"ghobhohi","created_utc":1707782372,"title":"Can you guys please answer this survey for a school project of mine?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Ok-Principle-7091","created_utc":1707785511,"title":"Conservative Christians are outraged at Pandora jewelry ad for showing happy lesbian couple","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1707785927,"title":"In California, will we have to choose between Adam Schiff and Katie Porter?","num_comments":36,"description":"Adam Schiff and Katie Porter seem to running back-to-back Senate political ads and it makes me wonder if we can choose both of them or we only get to vote for one.

However, it was dismissed without prejudice and could be brought up again.  \n\n\u201cWe are disappointed with the court\u2019s decision, which does not address the merits of our lawsuit, and we are weighing our next legal steps,\u201d PhRMA spokesperson Nicole Longo said in a statement to The Hill.  \n\nPhRMA represents some of the largest drug companies in the world. The group sued the administration in June, arguing Medicare negotiation is unconstitutional and violated drug companies\u2019 due process.  \n\nThere are eight other lawsuits filed by drug companies and other plaintiffs, and the legal fight could stretch for years.

The Tar Heel State was the first to attempt to ban transgender people from using the public bathroom of their choice in 2017. That law was repealed after a compromise by state legislators, but a later version was thrown out by a federal judge in 2019.\n\nTransgender issues have become a political flash point in GOP circles, specifically focusing on bathrooms and education.

As of 2022, there were 1,071 U.S. counties that fell into this category - together representing 13% of the U.S. population. The study found those counties have received nearly $82 billion of announced investments, double their share of gross domestic product and 1.2 times their share of the population.\n\nIndeed, a disproportionate share of the locales are Republican strongholds that regardless of Biden's largesse lean heavily toward former President Donald Trump in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, which is shaping up to be a rematch between the two men. In polling, Biden persistently gets low marks for his handling of the economy despite historically low unemployment, persistently strong job growth, and above-average wage increases, especially for the lowest-earning workers.\n\nThese investments are concentrated in the southern U.S. but extend across other regions - touching 27 states, the report found."},{"author":"Ssider69","created_utc":1707928731,"title":"Why John Bolton Is Certain Trump Really Wants to Blow Up NATO","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"Signal_Pattern7869","created_utc":1707930204,"title":"Speaker Mike Johnson literally married his daughter in a sort of mock marriage.","num_comments":42,"description":""},{"author":"maztabaetz","created_utc":1707932681,"title":"House Intel Chair Warns Biden of Mysterious \u2018Serious National Security Threat\u2019","num_comments":71,"description":""},{"author":"AdmiralSaturyn","created_utc":1707933543,"title":"A manufacturing investment supercycle is starting","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"DeeezDoughnutz","created_utc":1707936934,"title":"Someone photoshopped a beard on Greta","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"wdcmsnbcgay","created_utc":1707938801,"title":"Kamala Harris marks 20 years since first officiating same-sex marriages and reunites with gay couple she wed","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1707939028,"title":"North Texas districts facing budget challenges","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"audiomuse1","created_utc":1707939046,"title":"North Texas school districts facing budget challenges","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"GrizzVolsTigersLions","created_utc":1707941999,"title":"I live in detroit.

Their plans, if approved by a Trump White House, could cut hundreds of thousands of people from a program that conservatives have long complained is bloated \u2014 but the move could also save states and the federal government billions of dollars.\n\nWork requirements are among the many health priorities outlined in the 2025 presidential blueprint mapped out by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups.\n\nMany Republicans see reduced enrollment and cost savings as a benefit of the policy, with the Congressional Budget Office determining a federal work requirement would result in 1.5 million people losing federal funding for their coverage and save the federal government $109 billion over a decade.\n\nThe proposals vary but generally require Medicaid recipients to work 80 hours a month \u2014 or attend school, volunteer or participate in another kind of community engagement activity \u2014 with exceptions for certain people, like those who are pregnant, disabled or elderly.\n\nDemocrats argue that many people enrolled in Medicaid are already working and requiring people to provide proof will create more paperwork hurdles in an already complex program where people are prone to falling through bureaucratic cracks.\n\nBut Republican lawmakers are pitching the policy first and foremost as a way to encourage people to work as states grapple with low labor participation rates, though rates are higher among the 25- to 54-year-olds many of those states hope to target.\n\nIn Missouri and South Dakota, lawmakers hope to ask voters in November to allow work requirements. Both states approved Medicaid expansion through a constitutional referendum and can only amend the program through another ballot measure.\n\n\u201cThe voters overwhelmingly supported Medicaid expansion. Since that passed on the ballot, we have been dutifully implementing Medicaid expansion here in South Dakota,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is just coming back to the voters and asking them for clarity.\u201d"},{"author":"CommanderKiddie148","created_utc":1708436795,"title":"Republican Caught on HOT MIC Making HORRIFYING Statement","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"urmomsloosevag","created_utc":1708438134,"title":"Thousands rail against Mexico's president and ruling party in 'march for democracy'","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"walkingonmainst","created_utc":1708439659,"title":"Blatant preaching of politics from the pulpit","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"littleoldlady71","created_utc":1708440612,"title":"\u200ePod Save America: Trump\u2019s Get Out Of Jail Free Campaign (w\/ Gov.

The lawsuits target the state\u2019s Election Procedure Manual \u2014 which is designed to guide Arizona election officials in conducting and certifying elections. Republicans have challenged the manual several times, with RNC chair Ronna McDaniel arguing earlier this month that the document is \u201cdesigned to undermine election integrity.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s filing marks the latest effort from the DNC and Biden campaign to target perceived attempts to restrict voting with legal action in 2024, a key facet of the campaign\u2019s aggressive strategy this cycle. The campaign\u2019s legal team has overseen these moves, as President Joe Biden continues to push a message around voting rights and democracy.\n\nIn an effort to invalidate the entire document, the groups argue that Fontes did not provide enough time for public comment on the proposed changes, which must be approved by the attorney general and governor, both of whom are also Democrats. They also zeroed in on specific provisions in the manual, including a rule which Republicans argue limits the public\u2019s access to records containing a voter\u2019s signature. And they targeted a provision that allows federal-only voters who haven\u2019t proven their citizenship to vote in presidential elections.\n\nThe second GOP-led lawsuit attacks the manual\u2019s instructions for operating ballot drop-off locations and preventing voter intimidation.

The group will target Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and North Carolina, all likely to be battleground states in 2024.\n\nThey plan to \u201cshore up\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who has held the seat since 2007. He is one of the prime targets for Republicans who are hoping to flip back the upper chamber. In Texas, the PTP will back Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas), the leading Democratic candidate hoping to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), with Morgan calling it the \u201cbest pick-up opportunity for Democrats this cycle.\u201d In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) is in a similar position to Brown, running for reelection in a state Trump won in 2020. Now up against businessman Tim Sheehy (R), a Trump-backed candidate, Tester will get some help from PTP, but he will need to \u201cdrive the message\u201d since Montana is a \u201ctricky\u201d state.  \n\nOn the House side, the PTP will be active in swing districts of California and New York, looking to help oust Biden-district Republicans that helped the GOP secure the majority in the lower chamber. Since the House flipped red, the Republican majority has narrowed. This month, the GOP\u2019s advantage shrunk even more after former Rep. Tom Suozzi (D) won back his old seat in this month\u2019s special election. \n\nThe fourth priority for the PAC is state-level races. In a push to \u201cdiversify their programs\u201d this year, the PTP will help with down-ballot contests, namely in New Hampshire and Minnesota.

Supporters say the measure is needed to protect students who aren\u2019t transgender, while opponents in sometimes tearful testimony told lawmakers the measure would stigmatize and endanger transgender students who are already subject to bullying.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted 6-3 to pass Senate Bill 180, sending it on to the full Senat for more debate. It mirrors a 1993 federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Sen. Ed Setzler of Acworth, has pushed for the measure for years, because the federal law doesn\u2019t apply to state and local governments, which might deny things like permission to distribute religious literature or a zoning permit for a church without giving enough deference to religious freedom. But opponents warn that private businesses will use the law to do things like deny birth control coverage to their employees, and the legislation could blow holes in local laws that ban discrimination. Georgia has no statewide law banning discrimination.\n\nThe debate over the bill to regulate student bathroom use has the same outlines, with Republicans saying Georgians need protection and opponents saying the law will be weaponized against transgender students.\n\nThe measure also covers locker rooms and overnight school trips. It requires that schools find some other bathroom for transgender or other students uncomfortable using the bathroom that matches their birth sex. It was unclear from committee debate whether any Georgia school district has a policy that allows transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with their current gender identity.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s measure would let parents sue school districts if school officials let students use a bathroom that doesn\u2019t match their birth sex, and it would let the Professional Standards Commission, which licenses teachers and administrators, to investigate noncompliance."},{"author":"CommanderKiddie148","created_utc":1708659572,"title":"Supreme Court Ethics: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Tymofiy2","created_utc":1708667356,"title":"Russian historian gave a good speech on brainwashing and dictatorship","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"maztabaetz","created_utc":1708670358,"title":"\u2018We Didn\u2019t Get All The Way There On Jan 6\u2019: Trump Booster Pledges to End Democracy in CPAC Rant as Bannon Cheers On","num_comments":61,"description":""},{"author":"Vroges","created_utc":1708673432,"title":"Sudan at a crossroads: Growing concerns as Al-Burhan's actions align with interests of the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran, posing a comprehensive security threat.

They reflect the biases and ideologies of the data they are trained on, and the people who design and use them. AI-powered chatbots pose a significant threat by expediting the spread of false political information ahead of the 2024 U.S. elections. It enables anyone to create and spread political content without the need for technical expertise, raising concerns about the spread of false narratives and misinformation. Similarly, the use of AI in political campaigns will allow for instant responses, precise audience targeting, and democratization of disinformation, potentially influencing the outcome of elections.\n\nA recent study published by the Springer Journal of Public Choice investigated the political bias of ChatGPT. When it was asked to answer ideological questions while impersonating someone from a given side of the political spectrum, it presented a strong alignment with the responses associated with the Democrats, it indicated a clear bias towards the left side of the political spectrum.\n\nThis was further supported by additional robustness tests, such as the placebo test, which verified that ChatGPT\u2019s bias was not merely due to spurious relationships with the chosen categories. The evidence from the study suggests that ChatGPT supports Democrats side, indicating a clear political bias.\n\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that OpenAI\u2019s GPT models advance left-wing answers, leaning left-wing libertarian. The models are biased because they are trained on data that contains political biases. The study highlights that this bias can be influenced by the sources of data used for training, such as books, internet texts, news media, and social media from right- and left-leaning sources. The training data can reinforce the models\u2019 existing biases, leading them to favor a specific side. The article highlights that these biases can also be introduced as tech companies update their data sets and training methods.\n\nAs we approach the 2024 elections, we need to be vigilant and proactive, to ensure that AI serves and does not subvert democracy."},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1708706314,"title":"Return to the Moon: US space probe successfully lands on the surface","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1708707411,"title":"Trump's defense invokes presidential immunity in the case of withholding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1708708535,"title":"U.S. officials lament the lack of federal resources to address the growing threats to electoral security","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1708709325,"title":"Biden meets with the widow and daughter of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in San Francisco","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1708709978,"title":"New York judge rejects Trump's request to delay the $355 million fine payment for fraud cases by one month","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"amerhodzic","created_utc":1708710829,"title":"So I got another interesting email from Heritage about Project 2025","num_comments":15,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1708711959,"title":"Senate GOP group urges campaigns to come out swinging against Alabama IVF ruling","num_comments":13,"description":"The National Republican Senatorial Committee sent a memo to candidates Friday morning, urging them to \"clearly and concisely reject efforts by the government to restrict IVF,\" or in vitro fertilization, according to a copy obtained by Axios.

House members are not slated to return to Washington until Wednesday night and the Senate could face delays if rabble-rousers like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., try to block speedy passage of a funding measure.\n\nFour of the 12 appropriations bills \u2014 which would provide funding for agencies covered by Agriculture, Military Construction-Veterans Affairs, Energy-Water and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development \u2014 face the Friday deadline. The remaining eight appropriation bills, covering critical agencies like the Defense, State and Justice departments, face a March 8 deadline. It\u2019s that first tranche of bills that the House will vote on next week.\n\nSources made clear that Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, does not want to pass another stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution or CR.\n\nBut the CR is a \"might need\" for another week or two, one of the sources on the call said.\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s call, Johnson pushed back on the year-long CR, raising concerns about cuts to defense spending, the sources said.\n\nJohnson also lamented that the GOP is in a weaker negotiating position with the Democratic-led Senate because House Republicans have struggled to even pass a rule to move GOP legislation through the lower chamber.

For Warner, a staunch abortion opponent, it meant she could no longer stand by the Ohio Constitution she had proudly sworn an oath to uphold just over a year before.\n\nEarlier this year, former President Donald Trump refused to sign a loyalty oath in Illinois, a pledge that has been in place since the McCarthy era.

Similar concerns were expressed at the federal level in the landmark Dobbs case, which overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nChris Redfern said the Republican concerns over adding abortion rights to a state constitution is a marked contrast to how Democrats handled a previous flashpoint. He was elected chair of the Ohio Democratic Party in 2005 after voters inserted a ban on same-sex marriage in the state Constitution.

Businessman Bernie Moreno favors a federal ban at 15 weeks a timeline that Dolan also says he would back if \"late-term abortions\" become the \"norm.\" And while Dolan and Moreno both say they support exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the mother's life is in jeopardy, LaRose, who brags that his anti-abortion record \"is not something I run away from,\" is tougher to pin down.\n\nEarly voting for the March 19 primary began this week. Public polling has been limited, though Moreno is viewed as a slight front-runner, thanks to an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, who twice won the state by comfortable margins. Moreno and Dolan are heavily self-funding their campaigns and have been on air with TV ads for months.\n\nDuring a debate last month in Cleveland, LaRose and Moreno objected to the moderator's use of the word \"ban\" when asked about their position. But both confirmed they would support a federal law that restricts access to abortion. LaRose said \"there should be a bare minimum that we look at.\" Moreno endorsed a 15-week \"floor,\" with \"commonsense restrictions after 15 weeks.\"\n\nDolan, meanwhile, said he preferred not to legislate the issue at the federal level but that he would support a 15-week ban, with exceptions, if more states follow Ohio's lead and \"late term\" abortions \"become the norm\" nationally. Dolan, his rivals and other GOP candidates frequently use the phrase \"late term\" without defining what they mean.

However, many senior appropriators have acknowledged partisan riders as a key hurdle in talks.  \n\nThe House Freedom Caucus also sought to dial pressure up on Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) earlier this week to put forward a yearlong stopgap funding bill. The legislation would trigger automatic cuts to government spending if the party doesn\u2019t win concessions on controversial policy riders. \n\nSome of the measures the ultraconservative caucus has pressed for include efforts to reduce \u201cHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\u2019 salary to $0,\u201d target the Pentagon\u2019s abortion travel policy and defund Planned Parenthood. \n\nAt the same time, however, Democrats have also been applying pressure on the other side of the aisle to oppose the so-called poison pills.\n\nAs the clock ticks closer to the next shutdown threat, congressional leaders were expected to make an announcement on funding as soon as this weekend.

But the party\u2019s army of lawyers is, more quietly, sending a very different message. The RNC is fighting in courtrooms and legal filings in key election battlegrounds across the country to make it harder to cast a mail ballot and to have it counted.\n\nIt all amounts to a multi-pronged effort to suppress voting by mail, voting advocates say \u2014 one that could threaten access to the ballot this fall, especially for Democrats, who are now more likely than Republicans to use mail voting. At its core are legal arguments aimed at convincing judges to interpret the law in ways that are explicitly adverse to voters.\n\nThe RNC has said the goal is to obtain a ruling from a judge that bars post-Election-Day ballots from being counted not just in Mississippi but nationwide. The 5th Circuit, which contains Mississippi, is known as perhaps the most conservative judicial circuit in the country.\n\nElection law experts have said it\u2019s unlikely, but not impossible, that a court could accept the RNC\u2019s argument.\n\nIf the case were to reach the Supreme Court, at least one justice appears friendly. In 2020, when the court upheld Wisconsin\u2019s ban on late-arriving ballots, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that states have the right to set election deadlines \u201cto avoid the chaos and suspicions of impropriety that can ensue when thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election.\u201d"},{"author":"Competitive-Past-871","created_utc":1708908389,"title":"House GOP desperately rushes and scrambles to distance from Alabama IVF ruling","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1708911148,"title":"Duckworth skeptical Republicans will back her bill protecting IVF access","num_comments":3,"description":"\"Let's make it clear \u2014 Republicans will say whatever they need to say to try to cover themselves on this, but they've been clear,\" Duckworth said on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday.\n\n\"Not a single Republican has reached out to me on the bill.

You are not fooling anyone.\u201d \n\nPassing the legislation under regular Senate rules could take weeks, and Murray, who leads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Congress doesn\u2019t have that kind of time.

They\u2019re seeking to blame Trump for the lack of action at the border, while tying the former president and his party to Washington\u2019s dysfunction.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to question whether Biden can succeed in the border effort.\n\nPolling has shown voters trust Trump on immigration more than Biden, and that a sizable number of Americans think it is a pressing issue.\n\nThe arrest of an undocumented immigrant as a suspect in the death of a Georgia college student has further inflamed tensions on the issue.\n\nTrump, who will also be in Texas on Thursday for his own visit to the border, is almost certain to blame Biden for the surge of migrants into the United States and tie the death of Georgia student Laken Riley directly to Biden\u2019s policies.\n\nNonetheless, a number of Democrats argue Biden is right to take on Trump over the issue.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a vulnerability, you should run towards it. And they have something to sell because there was this bipartisan border deal that would have made a world of difference, and it was stopped because it was not good for Donald Trump. And voters need to know that,\u201d said Jim Kessler, vice president of policy for the left-center think tank Third Way.\n\nBiden\u2019s efforts to turn the border issue on Trump and Republicans may face an uphill battle.\n\nA Jan. 31 Bloomberg\/Morning Consult survey of voters in seven swing states found 61 percent said Biden was at least somewhat responsible for the surge of migration at the southern border, and 52 percent of respondents said they trusted Trump over Biden on immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has claimed Biden\u2019s trip to the border is a \u201clast-minute, insincere attempt\u201d to counter the former president\u2019s visit to Texas.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed Trump\u2019s trip to the border as a photo op, attacking the former president for his opposition to the border deal and for the extreme proposals he\u2019s laid out for a potential second term.\n\nSome Democrats argued Biden\u2019s position on the border is better than it has been in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Republicans killed the conservative border bill, Democrats are in a better spot in this debate in a long time,\u201d said Ivan Zapien, former executive director at the Hispanic Leadership Council of the Democratic National Committee. \n\n\u201cI think the message: We have a problem at the border, and we are trying to solve it, and the other side is not interested in solving it, is as strong as I can remember,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course, things will happen to challenge that. But the message frame is as strong as I have seen.\u201d"},{"author":"JellyToeJam","created_utc":1709221607,"title":"Question about Michigan primary results, am I wrong to be concerned?

Terri Collins, a Republican who sponsored the House version of the bill, shortly before the chamber\u2019s vote. \u201cDo we need to have the longer discussion? Yes, we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say that I\u2019m a conflicted human being about this is just being dead honest that I don\u2019t know the right answer to where we are,\u201d said state Rep. Arnold Mooney, a Republican who abstained from voting on the bill. \u201cI hate the fact that we have been put in a position to have to deal with something that wasn\u2019t a problem. Things were working fine.\u201d\n\nTheir Democratic colleagues argued the problem was of the Republican supermajority\u2019s own making, by approving fetal personhood language that was amended into the state constitution in 2018. It\u2019s an argument Democrats at the national level, including President Joe Biden, have also made as they seek to tie the current IVF conversation to the post-Dobbs debate on abortion in an effort to boost their electoral fortunes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good day when the chickens come home to roost,\u201d said state Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, a Democrat. \u201cI don\u2019t blame [the state Supreme Court] for the ruling they made because that was the only choice we gave them. We didn\u2019t clarify. We didn\u2019t specify. We said, \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how we thought in our itty bitty minds that something like this wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\nIn their effort to reach a compromise that would help the state\u2019s clinics, lawmakers have come under fire both from the anti-abortion movement and reproductive medicine groups. Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, lauded legislators for trying to protect IVF but called the bill \u201cinadequate\u201d because it \u201cfails to correct the Supreme Court\u2019s nonsensical stance that fertilized eggs are scientifically and legally equivalent to children.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a more permanent and thorough fix, it will be difficult to recruit new physicians to the state and build their practices so they can continue to provide the best possible care to Alabamians,\u201d Tipton said.\n\nStill, state lawmakers from both parties voiced reservations about the proposal. State Rep. Mark Gidley, a Republican, said he feared the legislation approved Thursday would be used by progressives to undermine the state\u2019s long-standing anti-abortion policies.\n\nRep. Ernie Yarbrough, a Republican who voted against the measure, said that the proposal would \u201cgrant immunity to murder,\u201d voicing the sentiments of many in the anti-abortion movement who argue that life begins at conception whether or not that happens inside the uterus.\n\n\u201cWhat I had learned and read up to yesterday had me very concerned that the Alabama Supreme Court, in a state whose official position is pro-life and therefore defends that life begins at fertilization, could have possibly, I don\u2019t know, but possibly uncovered a silent Holocaust going on in our state.\u201d\n\nAnd Democrats stalled passage of the legislation for hours in both the House and Senate, raising concerns about the broad immunity the legislation gives to providers and pressing for a more substantive change to state laws.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in Band-Aids,\u201d said state Rep. Barbara Drummond. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Alabama to come up with a solution.\u201d\n\nBut IVF patients who testified in the House health committee on Wednesday in support of the proposal stressed the urgent need for legislative action."},{"author":"icterinewarbler","created_utc":1709242676,"title":"Protest vote over Gaza is election warning Biden cannot ignore - BBC News","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"wdcmsnbcgay","created_utc":1709243572,"title":"Angry donors convert outrage over Nex Benedict\u2019s death into action giving to pro-LGBTQ+ candidates","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"emilyblunt2023","created_utc":1709245047,"title":"Enough said ","num_comments":15,"description":""},{"author":"Disastrous-Rabbit108","created_utc":1709249027,"title":"'Hound them': Supreme Court faces flood of protests over Trump immunity case","num_comments":154,"description":""},{"author":"Odd_Bandicoot_2991","created_utc":1709249578,"title":"The Boebert Crime Family Must Be Stopped","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CancelComputer1997","created_utc":1709250871,"title":"Ranked-Choice Voting is MAGA\u2019s Latest Target","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"14Healthydreams4all","created_utc":1709252138,"title":"With their \"Delay\" tactics, SCOTUS has just STALLED ALL CASES AGAINST dRUMPF Until AFTER the Election.

Under the court's ruling, the laws cannot be enforced.\n\nKrueger's decision referenced a Montana Supreme Court precedent from 1999 finding the state's constitutional right to privacy protects access to pre-viability abortion. The state's high court reaffirmed that precedent in a ruling last spring.\n\nA spokesperson for Attorney General of Montana Austin Knudsen said the state plans to appeal the ruling to the Montana Supreme Court, saying he's committed to \"protecting the health and safety of women and unborn babies.\"\n\nRepublicans in the state legislature continue to push for restrictions on abortion access.\n\nSeveral more anti-abortion rights laws are facing court challenges in Montana, including half a dozen from the 2023 legislative session.

Cost-sharing will likely deter patients \u2014 particularly those of limited means \u2014 from scheduling those procedures.  \n\n\u201cEverything is at stake. Vaccines, disease screening, PrEP for HIV, contraceptives \u2026 So we\u2019re really looking at a risk to a lot of current recommended preventive services,\u201d said Richard Hughes, a health care attorney at Epstein Becker Green.\n\nJudge Reed O\u2019Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas \u2014 who in 2018 said the entire ObamaCare law was unconstitutional before the Supreme Court overturned his decision \u2014 agreed and invalidated the entire task force. He also invalidated ObamaCare\u2019s HIV treatment mandate, saying it violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act by forcing one of the plaintiffs, a Christian employer, to pay for insurance that covers HIV prevention drugs. \n\nThe Biden administration appealed to the 5th Circuit, one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country. The panel hearing arguments Monday is comprised of two judges appointed by former President Trump and one appointed by President Biden.  \n\nThe ruling was partially paused by the 5th Circuit last summer to let the appeals process play out. The appeals court allowed the administration to continue enforcing the coverage requirements nationwide, except against the plaintiffs. But the lawsuit was sweeping. O\u2019Connor ruled against the preventive services mandate, but rejected arguments that would have eliminated the law\u2019s contraceptive coverage mandate, as well as requirements that insurers cover other services like vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis case is going to end up at the Supreme Court, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Laurie Sobel, associate director for women\u2019s health policy at KFF said, but depending on what the 5th Circuit decides, timing is critical.\n\nThe case hits at a hugely popular section of the ACA but is not a death blow to the law.  \n\nStill, part of what makes the impact so uncertain is that O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision applies only to preventive care recommendations adopted after 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed.

Republicans, meanwhile, have had to deal with contested primaries in numerous states, including Ohio, Michigan and Nevada. \n\nPolling has shown good news for the Democratic candidates. Biden has been trailing Trump in most swing state polls recently, but Democratic Senate candidates in the same polls have mostly led their likely Republican opponents. \n\nAn Emerson College Polling\/The Hill survey found Rep. Ruben Gallego, the likely Democratic nominee for Senate in Arizona, leading Kari Lake, the likely GOP nominee, by 7 points. He still led in a three-way hypothetical race that included Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who has not yet announced whether she will seek reelection.\n\nBiden trailed Trump in that poll by 3 points. \n\nSen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has comfortably led his likely Republican opponent Dave McCormick in multiple polls over the past two months, even as Biden is behind Trump in The Hill\/Decision Desk HQ\u2019s polling average of the state by 4 points. \n\nNot much polling has been conducted on the Michigan Senate race for retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow\u2019s (D-Mich.) seat, but the few polls have generally shown the likely Democratic nominee, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (Mich.), narrowly leading the major Republican candidates. Trump has been regularly ahead of Biden in the state by a few points. \n\nSlotkin and other Democrats may have to work against recent historical trends when it comes to split-ticket voting.\n\nThe party that won each state in the 2016 presidential race also carried the state\u2019s Senate contest. In 2020, Maine was the only state that voted for one party in the presidential race and elected a Republican senator, Sen. Susan Collins. \n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is running for reelection as the only Democratic statewide officeholder currently in the increasingly red-leaning Buckeye State. An Emerson College poll in January showed him with a slight lead over each of his potential Republican challengers. \n\nOhio-based Democratic strategist Jeff Rusnak argued that the state has a track record of being open-minded despite its leaning, pointing to the state\u2019s approval of a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights last November. \n\nHe said the fact the amendment was approved with nearly 57 percent of the vote means some voters who backed Trump in 2020 and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) in 2022 swung to support abortion protections in 2023. \n\nArizona-based GOP strategist Constantin Querard said Democrats should seek to distance themselves from Biden to give themselves a better chance in states like the Grand Canyon State, which he added should not be too difficult or come with a significant political cost.\n\nRepublican strategist Whit Ayres said he is skeptical about many people voting for one party in the presidential race and the other in down-ballot races. He suggested voters may be tempted to skip voting in the presidential election because they are turned off by Trump and Biden and just vote in the others.

He was sentenced to 5 months at the Rikers Island jail and served nearly 100 days there.  \n\nHis latest plea agreement with the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office comes just weeks before Trump is expected to stand trial on charges he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts. \n\nWeisselberg is not expected to cooperate against Trump, according to multiple reports. \n\nThat trial will mark the former president\u2019s first criminal prosecution \u2014 and the first criminal prosecution of any former American president.

It does not require us to address the complicated question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced,\u201d Barrett, Trump\u2019s last appointee to the high court, wrote in a concurring opinion.\n\n\u201cThe majority\u2019s choice of a different path leaves the remaining Justices with a choice of how to respond,\u201d Barrett continued. \u201cThe Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case.

It takes into account some, but not all, of Trump's stated plans to roll back Biden's climate policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBy rolling back many of President Biden's climate policies, a second Trump administration could lead to an estimated extra 4 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions by 2030, compared with a second Biden term.\n\nThese extra emissions could in turn doom the 1.5\u00b0C goal under the Paris Agreement, the study finds, especially with the former president reportedly preparing to undo many Biden initiatives.\n\nCarbon Brief concludes that under Trump, the U.S. would generate extra emissions through 2030 that would rival the combined annual CO2 output of both the European Union and Japan.\n\nThe research also notes a stark difference in U.S. emissions reductions through 2030 under the different candidates; the current target under Biden is a 50% to 52% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, relative to 2005 levels.\n\nUnder Biden, current policies would get the U.S. close to that goal, at about 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nUnder Trump, emissions cuts might amount to as little as 28% below 2005 levels by 2030, depending on the extent to which he is able to reverse Biden's climate policies.\n\nCarbon Brief's report shows that the emissions path during a second Trump term \"would negate \u2014 twice over \u2014 all of the savings from deploying wind, solar and other clean technologies over the last five years\" globally.\n\nA Trump win would conceivably dash remaining hopes of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels, Carbon Brief notes.\n\nUsing the updated social cost of carbon from the EPA, Carbon Brief calculates that the extra (theoretical) CO2 under a Trump restoration may cause global damages worth more than $900 billion."},{"author":"Ornery-Honeydewer","created_utc":1709741306,"title":"Was Melania Trump a Mail Order Bride?

Starting today, Primary Pivot will become Haley Voters for Biden, and urge anyone who supported Haley in a swing state to stick with the president in November.\n\n\u201cThis is an effort from people who have actually supported Nikki Haley to try to guide as many of them as possible toward the candidate that respects democracy, even if they may disagree with him politically,\u201d said Primary Pivot co-founder Robert Schwartz.\n\nIn a statement, Primary Pivot said it would focus on Haley voters in states where they could be counted \u2014 nearly 300,000 in Michigan, and nearly 250,000 in North Carolina. The super PAC, which started by urging New Hampshire Democrats to temporarily switch their registrations, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to activate potential Haley voters in South Carolina and Super Tuesday states.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to start this effort as soon as possible to lock in that kind of resentment toward the way Trump and MAGA have treated Haley voters,\u201d he said.\n\nCovering Haley last month, I met a decent number of voters who took Primary Pivot\u2019s advice \u2014 or agreed with it but weren\u2019t actually contacted by the PAC. Some Haley voters, said Schwartz, were Democrats who didn\u2019t really need a new push from them. But some were Republicans who needed to be convinced to switch sides this year, which was Schwartz\u2019s new mission.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to get their voter files, their location in these states, their education level, their income level \u2014 whether they live in the suburbs, their voting history, all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to micro-target these people as much as possible.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of skepticism about how many Haley voters are truly swing voters. In New York Magazine, Ed Kilgore looks at the polls and sees evidence that Trump-skeptical Haley supporters \u201care not flippable swing voters Trump would sacrifice, but may instead be 2020 Biden voters who weren\u2019t really on the table for Trump at all, from the get-go.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times spoke with dozens of Haley voters about what comes next. They found many fell into the \u201cdouble hater\u201d camp \u2014 disliking Trump, but also unenthusiastic or hostile towards Biden."},{"author":"Suzangercekleri","created_utc":1709767358,"title":"\ud83d\udcccErdo\u011fan: S\u00f6z konusu vatan\u0131m\u0131z\u0131n bekas\u0131, kimseyi g\u00f6z\u00fcm\u00fcz g\u00f6rmez","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Distinct-Temp6557","created_utc":1709771641,"title":"Democracy vs Republic: The Implications Beyond the Debate","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"better_world_economy","created_utc":1709773103,"title":"Does anyone really care about democracy?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1709774549,"title":"Minority business agency must serve all races, a federal judge rules","num_comments":0,"description":"The ruling sided with white business owners who claimed the program discriminated against them.\n\nJudge Mark T.

Pittman argued that it is \u201cfifty-five years too many.\u201d\n\nIn the ruling, Pittman argued that MBDA and the federal government have \u201cflagrantly\u201d violated constitutional rights \u201cfor years.\u201d He added, \u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d\n\nPittman ordered the agency to no longer impose the \u201cracial and ethnic classifications\u201d used in the past and no longer consider or use a business applicant\u2019s race or ethnicity \u201cin determining whether they can receive Business center programming.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the agency advertises services exclusively for some races and not others.

Both those issues are especially important to mixed-status families and symbolic of a broader link between Latinos of any status and immigration.\n\nStill, the Biden campaign\u2019s top issue, both broadly and for Hispanic voters, will be the economy. Immigration and border security rank sixth, listed as a top concern by 20 percent of voters, while 54 percent said cost of living.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign is preparing to hit Trump by reminding voters of his efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and the former president\u2019s budget proposals, all of which included cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThe Biden campaign is planning to lay out a jigsaw puzzle of Trump policies that trigger Latino discontent, from abortion restrictions to cuts to social services to blas\u00e9 attitudes on mass shootings to immigration restrictionism.\n\nThe attack lines will in certain ways mirror the Biden campaign\u2019s general public strategy but target specific concerns held by many Latino voters.\n\nChavez Rodriguez\u2019s team will also target Trump\u2019s opposition to Biden\u2019s legislative accomplishments, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded green energy jobs popular among Latinos.\n\nWith both campaigns preparing to bombard voters with negative messaging about the other side, team Biden\u2019s Hispanic-targeted long list of anti-Trump gripes will attempt to reverse the gains Trump made among Hispanic voters from 2016 to 2020.\n\nChavez Rodriguez \u2014 the first Latina to run a presidential incumbent\u2019s campaign \u2014 will be in charge of connecting the dots between Trump\u2019s words, proposals and allies, and the Hispanic community\u2019s fears.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump and his extreme allies\u2019 Project 2025 shows once again they don\u2019t care about the Latino community and will continue demonizing us for votes,\u201d Chavez Rodriguez said."},{"author":"devotional1993","created_utc":1709795489,"title":"The Rachel Maddow Show [9PM] 3\/6\/2024 | \ud83c\udd7c\ud83c\udd82\ud83c\udd7d\ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udd72 BREAKING NEWS Today March ...","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"devotional1993","created_utc":1709795489,"title":"The Rachel Maddow Show [9PM] 3\/6\/2024 | \ud83c\udd7c\ud83c\udd82\ud83c\udd7d\ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udd72 BREAKING NEWS Today March ...","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"zsreport","created_utc":1709812262,"title":"Trump a worse appeaser than Neville Chamberlain, leading Democrat (Jim Himes) says","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Ssider69","created_utc":1709812535,"title":"Trump allies on Republican National Committee want to help pay his legal bills","num_comments":21,"description":""},{"author":"cats_tenth_life","created_utc":1709815819,"title":"Nagging non-voters doesn't work!

If elected, he\u2019d be the first Black governor in state history.\n\nNow that he\u2019s under a bigger spotlight, however, Robinson\u2019s past remarks on topics ranging from LGBTQ issues to civil rights and slavery to women\u2019s issues are drawing fresh criticism and even raising worries among some Republicans that his divisive persona could cost them a winnable\u202frace.\u202f\n\nDemocrats, for their part, believe Robinson could turn off enough state voters with his words that it could propel Stein to victory as North Carolina\u2019s first Jewish governor. \n\nRobinson has repeatedly flirted with conspiracy theories on the campaign trail, including that Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nHe\u2019s also said in a video unearthed by HuffPost that he wishes he could return to a time before women had the right to vote, though Robinson\u2019s defenders say those remarks were taken out of context.\n\nWhile Robinson did say \u201cI absolutely want to go back to the America where woman couldn\u2019t vote,\u201d he went on to say, \u201cDo you want to know why?

And they are the reason why women can vote today.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear Robinson will do well with Black voters.\n\nTrump will be a big factor in the race, and Democrats plan to tie Robinson and Trump together. \n\nIn addition to his comments on voting rights for women, Robinson is a stanch anti-abortion advocate.\n\nNot all Republicans are so sure Robinson\u2019s nomination translates into defeat for their party."},{"author":"chicagomovieproducer","created_utc":1710092465,"title":"Raphael Warnock: Some Are Trying To 'Score Cheap Political Points' From Death Of Laken Riley","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"chicagomovieproducer","created_utc":1710094344,"title":"Black Democrat Women Are Ruled By Their Emotions \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udd2c\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\ude86\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\ude83\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\ude86\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\ude83\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\ude86","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"chicagomovieproducer","created_utc":1710094380,"title":"Hillary Clinton Started 3 Wars \ud83d\udca5\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83d\udc38\ud83d\ude43 Back Stabbed Obama","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"chicagomovieproducer","created_utc":1710094414,"title":"African Americans For Donald Trump \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1710094499,"title":"NYT columnist calls Biden SOTU speech a \u2018comeback\u2019 after saying he should not run","num_comments":19,"description":"New York Times columnist Ezra Klein walked back his previous demands for President Biden not to run for reelection, calling his State of the Union speech a \u201ccomeback\u201d for his electoral hopes on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf the Joe Biden who showed up to deliver the State of the Union address last week is the Joe Biden who shows up for the rest of the campaign, you\u2019re not going to have any more of those weak-kneed pundits suggesting he\u2019s not up to running for re-election,\u201d Klein wrote, referring to himself. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping he does.\u201d\n\nCiting his age and controversial response to the Israel-Hamas war, Klein previously said Biden should step aside and let a younger Democrat lead the party\u2019s 2024 ticket, given poor polling numbers. But after Thursday, his tune changed, with Klein encouraging the Biden campaign to double down on one of the president\u2019s points from his State of the Union speech: \u201cThe greatest comeback story never told.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s refrain of the American comeback is a sharp one,\u201d Klein wrote. \u201cIt does two things simultaneously. It reminds voters that there is something America is coming back from \u2014 namely, the dislocations of the pandemic, and the wild, erratic management style that Trump brought to it \u2014 and it lets Biden point to progress without declaring victory.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right message for an incumbent: There are good things happening,\u201d he continued. \u201cLet\u2019s keep going.\u201d\n\nDemocrats lauded Biden\u2019s speech as a sharp attack against Republican policy and as a coming out for a louder, livelier President Biden that shakes off previous criticisms over his age and mental wellbeing.\n\nKlein emphasized that while attacks on Trump and the threat he poses to democracy are important and effective, campaigning on substantive policy can win him the election. That means the economy, especially prices.\n\nKlein argues that the American comeback is the key to bridging the gap between what Americans are feeling and what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cBiden is practiced at talking about the threat that Trump poses to democracy. It\u2019s clearly what motivates him in this campaign,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut he, not Trump, is the incumbent, and Biden has lacked a simple frame to tell the story of his presidency \u2014 one that balances what he\u2019s achieved with what Americans still consider undone, and that reminds voters of what he inherited while still laying out a vision for where he\u2019s going.\u201d"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1710095355,"title":"[image processing failed]","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"enkrstic","created_utc":1710096981,"title":"Netanyahu vows to defy Biden\u2019s \u2018red line\u2019 and invade Rafah","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1710097371,"title":"Biden criticizes Netanyahu for not preventing more civilian deaths in Gaza","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1710097480,"title":"Biden regrets using the word \"illegal\" when referring to an undocumented migrant during speech","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"LolAtAllOfThis","created_utc":1710097766,"title":"Trump Warns Women That Immigrants Will Demand To Use 'Your Kitchen'","num_comments":122,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1710099234,"title":"Biden enacts budget law that ensures resources for key federal agencies until September","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1710099362,"title":"Biden downplays his age and appeals to his experience in campaign spot","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1710099496,"title":"The largest Latino political action committee in the US announces its support for Biden in the upcoming elections","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"realplayer16","created_utc":1710100965,"title":"Katie Britt used decades-old example of rapes in Mexico as GOP attack on Biden border policy","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"Free_Swimming","created_utc":1710101906,"title":"U.S. Employers Add 275,000 Jobs in Another Strong Month","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Baba10x","created_utc":1710102129,"title":"Steve Bannon suggests Donald Trump has been bought","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"audiomuse1","created_utc":1710102856,"title":"Federal judge in Texas blocks US labor board rule that would make it easier for workers to unionize","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1710104256,"title":"Battle for the House: 9 races that will determine the majority","num_comments":2,"description":"With Republicans holding just a slim majority in the lower chamber, several races in California and New York might determine who controls the majority in the lower chamber this fall: \n\nIn California\u2019s 13th District, Republican Rep.

Dave Min going up against Republican Scott Baugh.\n\nWith Rep. Elissa Slotkin\u2019s (D-Mich.) seeking retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow\u2019s (D) seat, Michigan\u2019s 7th Congressional District is up for grabs, with Republican Tom Barrett going up against Democratic state Sen.

With Biden likely to easily carry New York in November, D\u2019Esposito will have to rely on a relatively high amount of split-ticket voters as he did two years ago to win a second term. \n\nIn New York\u2019s 17th Congressional District, Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) seems likely to face former Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), who previously represented the district but lost a primary in a different district after the maps were redrawn. Jones\u2019s candidacy will give Democrats a familiar face and someone with past fundraising experience. \n\nIn New York\u2019s 22nd Congressional District, of all the potentially vulnerable New York House Republicans this fall, Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.) may have the most significant uphill battle.\n\nIn Ohio\u2019s 9th Congressional District, Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) has represented her state\u2019s 9th Congressional District for four decades and had a reliable Democratic-leaning constituency throughout much of her career. But Ohio\u2019s redistricting process after 2020 made her district a battleground. \n\nIn Oregon\u2019s 5th Congressional District, Democrats are looking to take back a seat that flipped into Republican hands for the first time in decades when Republican Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer won Oregon\u2019s 5th Congressional District in the midterms.

It will become law in July if Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) doesn't veto it, which is not expected.\n\nThe only requirement is chaplains pass a background check and allow their name and religious affiliation be posted on the school's website.\n\nWhile the bill's sponsor brushed off objections, saying chaplains have been in \"institutions for centuries,\" detractors raised alarm bells over the distinction between chaplains being available in a school versus a prison, hospital or military post.\n\nStates that have pursued chaplains in schools argue the U.S. Supreme Court is on their side.\n\nThey point to a 2022 decision in support of a fired Washington football coach who would publicly pray with players following games.\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court said those prayers are constitutional as long as students are not coerced to participate.

Shev Jones (D), who voted against the state's legislation, speculated it could be a springboard for the legislature to expand on in the future.\n\nFor now, the focus remains in other areas.

A lawsuit was filed in August, well before IVF took over the national conversation last month after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos are people.

We urge these members of Congress to continue to lead the fight for reforms like the Lowering Drug Costs for American Families Act so more families can afford their medications.\u201d\n\nThe ads come as Democrats mobilize for another election cycle in which they believe they can lean on the issue of health care to help them convince voters to back them. The Protect Our Care campaign comes amid a new flurry of Democratic spending: President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign launched a $30 million ad campaign of its own after the State of the Union to boost the president ahead of his re-election, and he plans to travel the country this month.\n\nBiden touts measures to lower prescription drug and insulin prices in his opening ad. The new Protect Our Care spots go into the same subject, pointing to portions of the Democrats' 2021 Inflation Reduction Act that caps the price of insulin for Medicare recipients and allows the federal government to negotiate some drug prices.\n\nThey feature a nurse celebrating the measures on drug prices, lamenting how her patients had been resorting to skipping medication in order to keep costs down.\n\n\"This will help so many of my patients afford the medicines they need,\" the nurse says in the spot. The ad goes on to call on Congress to pass new legislation aimed at providing additional health care savings for patients.\n\nThe new ads start airing Monday in the home districts of Democratic Reps. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado, Hillary Scholten of Michigan, Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, Susie Lee of Nevada, Steven Horford of Nevada, Pat Ryan of New York and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.\n\nAlmost all of the members backed by the ad buy face potentially competitive general election fights this fall, when partisan control of the the House of Representatives will be up for grabs, especially considering that Republicans have a narrow majority in the body. Democrats could flip the House with a net gain of four seats in the fall, but Republicans are also pushing for gains to pad their majority.\n\nProtect Our Care launched during the Trump administration, ahead of a 2018 midterms, when Democrats performed well amid a deep focus on the issue of health care. It's a nonprofit, which is why the ad promotes legislation instead of an explicitly political message."},{"author":"Pleasetakemecanada","created_utc":1710189053,"title":"The film the Trump Organization tried to suppress | You've Been Trumped Too (2020) | Full Film","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1710189119,"title":"Democrats need a party publication to counter the NYT's extreme anti-Biden sland","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"politicalthrow99","created_utc":1710189154,"title":"Democrats Need a Party Publication To Counter The Media's Extreme Anti-Biden Agenda","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"RepublicanUntil2019","created_utc":1710189326,"title":"I made 2 memes.

Youth mental health. College affordability.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s proposed budget for next fiscal year would make education investments, many of them unprecedented, that prioritize the needs of families. The budget blueprint outlines Biden\u2019s policy priorities during a year when he\u2019s on the campaign trail. Congress, however, holds the power of the purse and must draft legislation to set spending levels, a process that in recent years has rarely gotten done on time. The full budget for fiscal year 2024 is still in the works. \n\nReleased Monday, the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s budget request would set aside $25 million to incentivize school districts to start or scale up free high-quality preschool for economically disadvantaged children. It would also provide $40 million to support the mental health of K-12 students and staff and propose initiating a $25 million investment to help higher education institutions meet student mental health needs.\n\nContinuing to address college affordability after making a campaign promise to lower higher education costs, the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s budget request would raise the maximum Pell Grant award \u2014 a need-based financial award for college \u2014 by $750 or 10 percent, bringing it to $8,145 from $7,395. Similarly, the proposed budget would address the $1.73 trillion student loan debt crisis by giving the Office of Federal Student Aid a staggering $2.66 billion to support borrowers, many of whom are still adjusting after federal student loans entered repayment in October following a pandemic payment pause that began in March 2020. The budget blueprint also proposes ending origination fees, which lenders issue to process loans, on Federal Direct student loans. \n\nFunding under the budget request would address the educator shortage that has affected multiple states during the pandemic years by dedicating $2.9 billion to teacher training and development, a boost of about $100 million over fiscal year 2023 funding. This includes $125 million to develop a diverse teacher workforce and $125 million to reduce shortages of special education teachers. Overall, the Biden-Harris budget request would route $14.4 billion for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a $200 million increase over the funding finalized in the 2023 budget. \n\nThe proposed budget also earmarks $200 million to expand the full-service community schools program (FSCS), doubling since 2021 the federal government\u2019s financial investment in FSCS, which provides resources ranging from health care to nutrition assistance for students and their families at school sites.\n\nKeri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, which advocates for improving the lives of children and families, mostly applauded Biden\u2019s budget plan. \u201cThe proposed enhancements, particularly in early childhood education and support mechanisms for low and middle-income families, highlight a comprehensive strategy that can significantly contribute to alleviating child poverty and improving educational outcomes,\u201d she said in a statement."},{"author":"Kunphen","created_utc":1710249696,"title":"The GOP\u2019s real long term plan","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Kunphen","created_utc":1710249737,"title":"\"Trump Employee 5\" just exposed Donald Trump\u2019s Bedminster plot","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1710250910,"title":"Biden budget focuses on unfinished health care business","num_comments":0,"description":"The budget calls for expanding Medicare's drug negotiation program and extending Medicare caps on insulin and out-of-pocket costs to people with private insurance.\n\nThe budget also calls for a permanent expansion of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage that he pushed through Congress but are set to expire after 2025.\n\nIn other unfinished business, the budget outlines a 10-year, $150 billion increase for Medicaid home- and community-based services after a major expansion he campaigned on in 2020 was set aside by Congress.\n\nIt also renews Biden's call to create a federal coverage option for low-income people in states that haven't expanded Medicaid under the ACA.\n\n\"While my administration has seen great progress since day one, there is still work to do.

Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), ranking member of the House Rules Committee, the Democrats\u2019 discharge petition would require 218 signatures to force consideration of a Senate-passed foreign aid package, which provides $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and humanitarian assistance in Gaza. \n\nThe Senate had passed the bill last month by a vote of 70-29, with 22 Republicans \u2014 including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u2014 supporting the legislation. \n\nBut the proposal has hit a brick wall in the lower chamber, where Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has refused to consider it, citing the absence of language to strengthen security on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTo break the logjam, McGovern and Democratic leaders are hoping to find enough bipartisan support for the discharge petition to sidestep Johnson\u2019s opposition and bring the Senate bill to the floor, where they predict it would pass easily with more than 300 votes.\n\nSome liberal Democrats are already balking at the idea of providing more military aid to Israel \u2014 as the Senate bill does \u2014 amid a war with Hamas that\u2019s already killed more than 30,000 people in Gaza. Those lawmakers want conditions put on that aid, ensuring Israel complies with international human rights guidelines. \n\nAcross the aisle, meanwhile, even moderate Republicans \u2014 those deemed most likely to endorse McGovern\u2019s discharge petition \u2014 are hammering the Democrats\u2019 strategy of insisting on the Senate\u2019s version of the foreign aid package. Those voices say no Ukraine aid can pass through the House without tougher border security. \n\nHoping to bridge that divide is Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), who has introduced his own discharge petition designed to force a vote on a broader Ukraine package that includes the border security provisions many Republicans are demanding. \n\nThat proposal has already won the support of a handful of moderate Democrats, who are warning that their approach is the only viable way to get more Ukraine aid to President Biden\u2019s desk this year. \n\nYet Democratic leaders are warning that Ukraine \u2014 which is under siege from Russian forces and running low on ammunition \u2014  simply doesn\u2019t have the time to wait for Congress to bounce competing bills back and forth between the two chambers.

The IRA also had the 15-percent corporate alternative minimum tax, which current officials described as an \u201cimportant step in the direction\u201d of the current proposal seeking to bump it up to 21 percent. \n\nThe current budget once again seeks to reform taxation of investment income, increasing the rate to 37 percent for people with income above $1 million. \n\nOn the tax front, conservatives are pushing for an extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 law, which they argue enacted \u201cpro-growth\u201d policies that their latest budget resolution supports. \n\nTrump, for his part, has called for a fresh round of tax cuts if he wins the presidency this year. \n\n"},{"author":"Cloaked42m","created_utc":1710330934,"title":"House Democrats try to force floor vote on foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"ToffeeFever","created_utc":1710331761,"title":"'Who does that?'

Kathy Hochul won her own race by a surprisingly narrow margin, and New York Republicans flipped three House seats. Now the New York governor is aiming to avoid another down-ballot disaster for Democrats in her home state.\n\nHochul, who struggled with early tactical fights in the state capital, is putting money and her own political clout on the line as she seeks to become a national surrogate for President Joe Biden and Democratic House candidates and ensure New York is a bulwark against another red wave.\n\nShe is reviving New York\u2019s moribund Democratic Party infrastructure and carefully laying the groundwork to build out the organization by infusing it with staff, money and updated technology to aid down-ballot House candidates. Her effort also comes as Mayor Eric Adams remains on the outs with Biden and faces scandals back home, allowing Hochul to join Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as New York\u2019s top party champions.\n\nNow as a migrant crisis threatens to upend Democratic chances much like the crime debate, Hochul has seized main-character energy in New York\u2019s sharp-elbowed political world. Her twin goals: help reelect Biden and boost the chances of Democrats trying to flip the House.\n\nThe governor\u2019s role with Democrats nationally is also playing out at home.\n\nShe\u2019s raised $2.5 million for the state party since last summer. She recently hired Jen Goodman, a Democratic consultant who worked on Hochul\u2019s 2022 bid, to handle communications for the party and to advise her politically.

The agency has asked a legislative panel to approve an emergency rule spelling out the new process.\n\nRepublican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who last year signed an executive order banning gender-neutral terms from state documents, called the move \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m governor, Arkansas state government will not endorse nonsense,\u201d Sanders said in a news release.\n\nThe move is latest among Republican states to legally define sex as binary, which critics say is essentially erasing transgender and nonbinary people\u2019s existences and creating uncertainty for intersex people \u2014 those born with physical traits that don\u2019t fit typical definitions of male or female.\n\n\u201cThis proposed policy seeks to erase the existence of non-binary and intersex Arkansans by denying them identity documents that reflect their true selves, forcing them into categories that do not represent their identities,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas said in a statement.\n\nAt least 22 states and the District of Columbia allow \u201cX\u201d as an option on licenses and IDs. All previously issued Arkansas licenses and IDs with the \u201cX\u201d designation will remain valid through their existing expiration dates, the department said. Arkansas has more than 2.6 million active driver\u2019s licenses, and 342 of them have the \u201cX\u201d designation. The state has about 503,000 IDs, and 174 with the \u201cX\u201d designation.The changes would also make it more difficult for transgender people to change the sex listed on their licenses and IDs by requiring an amended birth certificate be submitted. Currently, a court order is required to change the sex listed on a birth certificate in the state.\n\nUnder the new rules, the sex listed on an Arkansas driver\u2019s license or ID must match a person\u2019s birth certificate, passport or Homeland Security document. Passports allow \u201cX \u201das an option alongside male and female. If a person\u2019s passport lists \u201cX\u201d as their gender marker, the applicant must choose male or female, Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin said.\n\nDFA Secretary Jim Hudson said in a statement that the previous practice wasn\u2019t supported by state law and hadn\u2019t gone through the public comment process and legislative review required by law.\n\nThe policy comes after Arkansas has enacted several measures in recent years targeting the rights of transgender people, including a ban on gender affirming care for minors that\u2019s been struck down by a federal judge as unconstitutional. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear oral arguments next month in the state\u2019s appeal of that decision."},{"author":"littleoldlady71","created_utc":1710343874,"title":"How Alleged Geezer Joe Biden Caught Rob Hur and Mark Krickbaum Trying to Sandbag Him","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Baba10x","created_utc":1710344117,"title":"Joe Biden suddenly leads Donald Trump in multiple polls","num_comments":61,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1710344488,"title":"The National Guard Is a \u201cWTF\u201d Moment for New York\u2019s Subways.

The former president provided no evidence for his claim. \u201cThey are a true Enemy of the People.\u201d\nOn CNBC, Trump said that he believes TikTok is a national security threat. But, he added, \u201cYou ban TikTok, Facebook and others, but mostly Facebook, will be a big beneficiary. And I think Facebook has been very dishonest. I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.\u201d\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said Tuesday that Trump views Chinese ownership of TikTok as a national security threat but appreciates that millions of people like the app.\n\n.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments on TikTok have had immediate reverberations on Capitol Hill, where Republicans who had for years called for prohibiting the app over concerns that ByteDance might be controlled by Chinese authorities were torn between their loyalty to the former president and their prior positions.\nThe House is expected to vote Wednesday morning on legislation that would force ByteDance to divest TikTok within 165 days of enactment \u2014 and would prohibit the app from being used in the United States if the company didn\u2019t comply. The Senate hasn\u2019t yet signaled whether it will follow suit.\nAs president, Trump issued an executive order in 2020 that declared that TikTok threatened \u201cthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,\u201d although he backed off a ban before that fall\u2019s election, in part because he saw the move as unpopular and likely to alienate young voters.\n\nHis reversal now is also partially the product of a lobbying campaign connected to a GOP megadonor with connections that reach into Trump\u2019s inner circle.\nThe investment company of billionaire Jeff Yass owns 15 percent of ByteDance, which would amount to roughly $40 billion of the company\u2019s $268 billion valuation. Asked by CNBC about a recent meeting he had with Yass, Trump said that the GOP donor \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d in their conversation and that Yass\u2019s wife instead pushed for school choice reform. Yass had been a critic of Trump\u2019s in the past.\nBehind the scenes, however, Trump and his aides have spoken about TikTok to people with direct financial ties to Yass. Yass is the biggest donor to the conservative organization Club for Growth, which is currently paying former Trump senior counselor Kellyanne Conway to defend TikTok on Capitol Hill and which recently reconciled with Trump after a feud last year. Conway has also spoken to Trump about the importance of defending the social media app, according to two other people familiar with the matter, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations.\nThese people said Conway told Trump that the app was popular and that many of his supporters were on it \u2014 an argument echoed by other pro-TikTok allies \u2014 and that they were not being censored in their support of him.\n\nKellyanne Conway records a speech Washington in 2020. (Demetrius Freeman\/The Washington Post)\n\u201cI made clear that it\u2019s Trump\u2019s supporters who are organically posting on TikTok their support for him and his reelection,\u201d Conway said in an interview.\n\n\u201cFor President Trump, he has made clear this is about abruptly taking away something from millions of users, many of whom are his people on TikTok, and it\u2019s about Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d she said."},{"author":"Kunphen","created_utc":1710356614,"title":"Donald Trump, sociopath","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Kunphen","created_utc":1710357662,"title":"The Great Republican Purge is underway","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1710358208,"title":"Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"CharlieX99","created_utc":1710359065,"title":"Trump privately defended Hitler's work in Germany, according to leaks made by his former chief of staff to a journalist","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"emilyblunt2023","created_utc":1710359206,"title":"Vote Democrats for a better America ","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"h20poIo","created_utc":1710361842,"title":"House Republicans Are Suddenly Desperate to End Biden Impeachment.

Enacting a new tax law would give President Biden and Democrats an achievement to campaign on, something that Republicans may prefer to avoid.\n\nSenate Republicans have expressed a variety of concerns, fixating primarily on a so-called look-back provision that would allow parents to use their previous year\u2019s earnings to claim a larger child tax credit. Republicans argue the measure would weaken work incentives because it would allow parents who had little to no income in the current year to still claim a credit of up to $2,000 per child.\n\nThe G.O.P. also has portrayed the mechanism for financing the bill as a sham, since the program that would be ended to pay for the tax provisions has cost the government far more than expected.\n\nSenate Republicans have also complained that they were cut out of the deal, since it was reached and presented by Mr. Smith and Mr. Wyden without an endorsement from Senator Michael D. Crapo of Idaho, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, who opposes it. The negotiators tried months ago to get Mr. Crapo on board, including by limiting the look-back provision in the child tax credit, but ultimately announced the bill without his backing.\n\nNow Senate Republicans have said they want the chance to overhaul the bill in the Finance Committee.\n\nAny major changes to the bill would most likely sap support among Democrats, who overwhelmingly back the package as is. And they would punt the bill back to the chaotic House, which has struggled for months to conduct regular legislative business.\n\nMr. Wyden said he was open to hearing Republicans\u2019 concerns but was worried that they had yet to winnow a \u201csmorgasbord of ideas\u201d for changes they were requesting.\n\nWhile Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, has said he supports the bill, he has yet to commit to a floor vote.\n\nEven so, the politics of an election year are hanging over the bill, raising the question of whether G.O.P. leaders really want to advance a measure that would give Mr. Biden and Democrats an achievement to tout on the campaign trail.\n\nRepublicans see an opportunity to win the Senate majority in November, a shift in control that would position Mr. Crapo to be chairman of the Finance Committee. Some, including Mr. Tillis, have argued that Republicans will have more leverage to negotiate a tax bill next year, when former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law is set to expire.\n\nMr. Crapo insisted that he was not seeking to slow-walk the bill."},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1710382839,"title":"Bipartisan Tax Bill Is Stuck in Senate Limbo After Broad House Approval","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"baguette_meister","created_utc":1710383277,"title":"a bit old but yeah good thing the us is sending \"humanitarian assistance\" right ?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Baba10x","created_utc":1710383928,"title":"Live updates: House passes bill that could lead to US ban of TikTok","num_comments":13,"description":"POTUS is eagerly waiting to sign it.

They have called for the agency to also address pollution coming from offsite warehouses where medical devices treated with ethylene oxide are stored. \n\nAsked about this, an administration official told reporters Wednesday that the agency would need more information on things like their level of emissions and how those emissions can be reduced.\n\nThe official said that the agency was planning to take additional steps to gather that information and could regulate warehouses in the future.\n\nThe EPA is also giving the industry more time to adjust to the rule than when it was first proposed last year.\n\nAt that time, it said companies would have 18 months to comply. Now, it says that the largest facilities will have two years to comply, while smaller facilities will have three years, with a possible additional year extension.\n\nMeanwhile, the industry has pushed back on the EPA\u2019s efforts. A trade group said last year that the proposed \u2014 and now changed \u2014 timeline was too short, and also accused the agency of overstating the chemical\u2019s toxicity.\n\nIt is expected to cost $313 million to comply with for the nation\u2019s 88 existing and two planned facilities using the substance. \n\nHowever, the rule is also expected to reduce cancer risks for the 19,000 people who are currently exposed to the toxic chemical in concentrations that bring their risk of cancer to levels considered unacceptable by the agency."},{"author":"politicalthrow99","created_utc":1710423794,"title":"Democrats prepare to go to war against third-party candidates","num_comments":58,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1710424455,"title":"Trump's MAGA movement is causing Republicans in Congress to hate each other","num_comments":122,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1710425832,"title":"Biden administration announces $120 million for tribal climate resilience","num_comments":1,"description":"The Biden administration will fund 146 tribal climate resilience projects to the tune of $120 million, Interior Department officials announced Thursday.\n\nThe funds include $71 million in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funds, $26 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds and $23 million from annual appropriations for fiscal 2023.

This significantly reduces wait time for work authorization (down from several months), so refugees can begin working in the U.S. soon after arriving. \n\nUnder the new system, as soon as a refugee enters the U.S., USCIS will digitally generate Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization) for them. Once approved, refugees will typically receive their EAD within one to two weeks by mail. Additionally, USCIS will now electronically provide the Social Security Administration with the necessary information to assign Social Security numbers and send Social Security cards to refugees so they can begin working.\n\nAll eligible refugees admitted into the country on or after December 10, 2023, will receive their EADs and Social Security cards based on this new process.\n\nIn the U.S., refugees have the legal right to work upon arrival. Previously, they had to go through a time-consuming paper-based application to obtain EADs. The new fully automated process eliminates the need for refugees to apply for their own EADs, leading to quicker processing of Form I-765 and faster delivery of EADs after approval. \n\nImmigration advocates have praised the updated guidelines, as work authorization and Social Security information are critical for newly-arrived refugees to begin their lives in the U.S. USCIS says the update is part of the agency\u2019s commitment to increase efficiency and improve the customer experience by streamlining and digitizing the immigration process."},{"author":"CommanderKiddie148","created_utc":1710431467,"title":"Swalwell Goes OFF: \"Have You All Lost Your Minds?\"","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Samwoodstone","created_utc":1710431551,"title":"'Trump Loses': Fox News Voter Analysis Predicts Disastrous Defeat","num_comments":35,"description":"Remember 2016?

The district attorney may choose to step aside, along with the whole of her office, and refer the prosecution to the prosecuting attorneys\u2019 council for reassignment,\u201d Judge Scott McAfee, the judge overseeing the case, wrote on Friday.\n\nHe added that alternatively Wade can withdraw \u201callowing the district attorney, the defendants, and the public to move forward without his presence or remuneration distracting from and potentially compromising the merits of this case\u201d.\n\nThe question at the heart of the matter was whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because of her relationship with Wade. Michael Roman, one of the 14 remaining defendants in the case, filed a motion in January saying Willis should be disqualified from handling the case because of her romantic relationship with Wade, which was not publicly known at the time.\n\nThe two eventually admitted their relationship, but said it did not begin until 2022, after Wade was hired to work on the Trump case. Wade acknowledged that he paid for vacations for the two of them to places such as Napa in California and Aruba, but he and Willis both said she paid him back in cash.\n\nMcAfee said the arrangement presented the appearance of a conflict of interest, which was enough to warrant at least Wade\u2019s removal.\n\n\u201cAs the case moves forward, reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued resulting in some form of benefit to the district attorney, or even whether the romantic relationship has resumed,\u201d he wrote on Friday.\n\n\u201cPut differently, an outsider could reasonably think that the district attorney is not exercising her independent professional judgment totally free of any compromising influences. As long as Wade remains on the case, this unnecessary perception will persist,\u201d he added.\n\nThe hearing dived deeply into the personal lives of Wade and Willis, and featured dramatic testimony from Willis in which she bluntly accused Roman\u2019s lawyers of lying and sought to regain control over one of the most high-stakes trials in America.\n\nIt also muddied the waters of the case \u2013 transforming a blockbuster prosecution about a criminal scheme to overturn the election into a salacious hearing about the love life of the district attorney. It was a transformation that Willis seemed keenly aware of when she took the stand in mid-February.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re confused. You think I\u2019m on trial. These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020.

Willis\u2019s lawyers cast Bryant-Yeartie as a disgruntled former employee of the district attorney\u2019s office who had an axe to grind. No other witness corroborated her testimony.\n\nThe star witness for the defense was supposed to be Terrence Bradley, a former law partner of Wade\u2019s.

But Biden knows all too well that much of this progress would be rapidly undone if avowed climate denier Donald Trump becomes president again.  \n\nAs the 2024 campaign against Trump begins in earnest, Biden is revising key energy and climate rules to make them more beneficial to middle-income consumers, businesses and, he hopes, swing state voters. In the process, he should create regulatory and tax policies on climate that will be more enduring for consumers and the economy in the long run, while also helping him win a second term. \n\nLast month, the administration wisely announced a decision to revise overly strict draft EPA auto fuel efficiency and emissions standards, which would in effect have required two-thirds of all new cars to be all-electric by 2032, even though today only about fewer than 10 percent of new cars are all electric. The initial rules were out of step with real-world purchasing and production, prompting attacks from both Trump Republicans and some consumers. EV adoption, although rapid, has been a bit slower than anticipated, with GM, Ford and other automakers trimming EV production from previously announced levels.  \n\nBut when revising these standards, the administration needs to provide more options for transition vehicles that offer consumers greater range, convenience and cost benefits to gain greatest political benefit.  \n\nThe Biden EPA also recently announced its intention to regulate emissions from existing and new coal-fired power plants and from new gas-fired power plants, but not existing gas plants. This delay on regulating existing gas plants means that they will not immediately face a requirement to capture their carbon dioxide emissions before 2040, another prudent decision, since such regulations would be deliberately misconstrued by Republicans and misunderstood by voters ahead of the election (and could in any event be subject to lawsuits and congressional reviews undermining their effectiveness). Handling regulations on existing gas plants after the election in a second Biden term is far more likely method to successfully cut emissions by promulgating regulations that will stand up to congressional and legal challenge. \n\nFinally, the administration\u2019s recent decisions have generally favored existing climate and emissions models so ethanol can keep playing a role in reducing U.S. auto emissions, and especially to allow ethanol used for sustainable aviation fuel to better qualify for important tax credits. While additional decisions are still to come, Biden should allow ethanol to continue to displace oil, while also benefitting swings states like Wisconsin and key Democratic farm districts in the Midwest and Corn Belt. \n\nSome of Biden\u2019s recent actions have been more symbolic than policy driven. The administration\u2019s highly questionable decision to put a pause on LNG export licenses was firmly aimed at the youth vote and obstreperous climate activists who threaten to publicly besmirch Biden\u2019s sterling climate credentials. Yet the Biden team has made the mitigation of methane emissions from U.S. natural gas a top priority; U.S. gas has far lower lifecycle emissions than not only natural gas competitors like Russia, according to most analysis, but also coal. Far-left activists have ignored this accomplishment that will lower U.S. methane and overall greenhouse gas emissions even more in coming years.  \n\nMore broadly, the U.S. political and climate communities have yet to acknowledge the wisdom of Biden\u2019s election-year climate and energy shift toward consumers. And of course Trump\u2019s reactionary forces will falsely attack Biden\u2019s thoughtful policies as culture war symbols. But from both a climate and economic perspective, Biden efforts to meet the concerns of consumers and voters are the most responsible way forward. And they are also crucial to making sure Donald Trump\u2019s scorched earth policies never see the Oval Office again.

By taxing extreme wealth and investing those revenues in social goods like education, housing, food and health care. President Biden\u2019s recently released federal budget plan follows that blueprint, putting the value of investing in American families and communities ahead of slashing taxes for the rich.\n\nThe proposed budget invests $2.3 trillion towards essential public services for hard-working families while reducing the national debt by almost $3 trillion. That\u2019s a great start toward filling critical investment gaps for families and communities. \n\nThough much more is needed, this effort to reduce homelessness by providing access to safe affordable housing in a tight housing market \u2014 with high rent prices and often insufficient wages \u2014 is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget request also tackles hunger and poverty. The Biden budget also expresses that families should be able to afford child care. Critically, the president\u2019s budget would restore the expanded Child Tax Credit from the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan, which increased payments, expanded eligibility and made the payments monthly, all resulting in slashing child poverty in half for the duration of the program.\n\nThe budget would also protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid while lowering prescription drug prices and subsidizing healthcare premiums under the Affordable Care Act, providing health coverage assistance, increasing the affordability of higher education, and much more.\n\nHowever, in one key respect, the values in this budget are significantly out of step: military spending.\n\nWhile much more needs to be done, a budget document with tax and investment priorities reflecting the needs of the people rather than ever-increasing corporate profit and excessive wealth is a good step in the right direction."},{"author":"Commercial-Archer-52","created_utc":1710613125,"title":"Republican \u201cChristians\u201d","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"PradaPradaPrada","created_utc":1710614591,"title":"How to get more politically involved in Florida?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1710615316,"title":"Ankle Monitors and Curfews: Inside Biden\u2019s New Tracking System for Migrant Families","num_comments":1,"description":"The goal of the program is to keep families from skipping out on their asylum hearings and melting away into American society, joining the millions of undocumented people who stay in the country indefinitely under the radar of U.S. authorities.\n\nIf the families fail their asylum screenings, they can be deported within weeks. The asylum process usually takes years, with most claims ultimately rejected.\n\nSo far, the Family Expedited Removal Management program has tracked more than 19,000 people since May, according to data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that was obtained by The New York Times. More than 1,500 of them have been deported and around 1,000 have absconded by prying off their ankle monitors, the ICE data show. The rest either passed their initial screenings or still have cases underway.\n\nAlthough the program has been used in only a fraction of claims, some U.S. officials see it as a test case for a faster way to deal with families seeking refuge in America, where laws require the government to consider asylum claims from anyone who makes it onto U.S. soil.\n\nThey hope the program can provide an alternative to the usual options for handling migrant families: detaining them in costly ICE facilities, which President Biden has criticized, or releasing them with court dates years in the future and no consistent way of tracking them.\n\nThe new program aims to screen families and quickly deport those who don\u2019t meet the bar for credible fear. Mr. Giles, the ICE official who runs the program, said that ICE gives migrants a list of free legal service providers when they are processed into the program.\n\nFor the Biden administration, speed is the whole point.

But Biden knows all too well that much of this progress would be rapidly undone if avowed climate denier Donald Trump becomes president again.  \n\nAs the 2024 campaign against Trump begins in earnest, Biden is revising key energy and climate rules to make them more beneficial to middle-income consumers, businesses and, he hopes, swing state voters. In the process, he should create regulatory and tax policies on climate that will be more enduring for consumers and the economy in the long run, while also helping him win a second term. \n\nAs both an economic and political matter, the White House should revise pending fuel economy rules so that vehicles like plug-in hybrids can better qualify and consumers have more transition vehicle options over the next decade. This action will be crucial to changing popular and political narrative on the electric vehicle transition away from proscribing just all electrics toward Biden offering greater consumer options. Such changes will help reduce the urban-rural cultural divide over electric vehicles, and undercut the negative narrative of an EV culture war Trump and other Republicans are fomenting. \n\nFinally, the administration\u2019s recent decisions have generally favored existing climate and emissions models so ethanol can keep playing a role in reducing U.S. auto emissions, and especially to allow ethanol used for sustainable aviation fuel to better qualify for important tax credits. While additional decisions are still to come, Biden should allow ethanol to continue to displace oil, while also benefitting swings states like Wisconsin and key Democratic farm districts in the Midwest and Corn Belt. \n\nSome of Biden\u2019s recent actions have been more symbolic than policy driven. The administration\u2019s highly questionable decision to put a pause on LNG export licenses was firmly aimed at the youth vote and obstreperous climate activists who threaten to publicly besmirch Biden\u2019s sterling climate credentials. Yet the Biden team has made the mitigation of methane emissions from U.S. natural gas a top priority; U.S. gas has far lower lifecycle emissions than not only natural gas competitors like Russia, according to most analysis, but also coal. Far-left activists have ignored this accomplishment that will lower U.S. methane and overall greenhouse gas emissions even more in coming years\n\nMore broadly, the U.S. political and climate communities have yet to acknowledge the wisdom of Biden\u2019s election-year climate and energy shift toward consumers. And of course Trump\u2019s reactionary forces will falsely attack Biden\u2019s thoughtful policies as culture war symbols. But from both a climate and economic perspective, Biden efforts to meet the concerns of consumers and voters are the most responsible way forward. And they are also crucial to making sure Donald Trump\u2019s scorched earth policies never see the Oval Office again.

It is far from the first time Trump has called for benefit cuts, but it is among the clearest. Along with planning to cut Social Security, Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit the uber-wealthy.\n\nIn stark contrast, President Biden\u2019s recently released 2025 budget calls for expanding Social Security while requiring those same uber-wealthy to pay their fair share. Biden vows to veto any and all cuts. As he said in the State of the Union, \u201cIf anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop them!\u201d\n\nThat is the Democratic Party\u2019s vision for Social Security\u2019s future. It is the same vision that inspired the Democrats who enacted Social Security in 1935. President Franklin Roosevelt and his colleagues believed that paid medical leave would be added over time, together with larger benefits, universal health insurance, short-term disability benefits and more.\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican Party have a very different vision and plan. While massively exploding the deficit with tax handouts to their wealthy donors, Republicans insist that Social Security is unaffordable \u2014 despite the fact that, as even Ronald Reagan acknowledged, Social Security doesn\u2019t contribute a single penny to the deficit. \n\nIt\u2019s time for that to change.\n\nBoth parties are returning to their roots on Social Security. Republicans fought hard against the creation of Social Security. Their 1936 presidential nominee Alf Landon called it a \u201ccruel hoax.\u201d Democrats created Social Secuity and regularly expanded it for decades.\n\nTrump and Republicans running for Congress want to cut Social Security and give tax breaks to the wealthy. Biden and Democrats running for Congress want to protect and expand Social Security, paid for by requiring millionaires and billionaires to contribute their fair share.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s budget shows that he is the heir to Franklin D. Roosevelt, while Trump\u2019s CNBC comments show that he is the heir to Alf Landon. Americans should vote accordingly this November."},{"author":"Stock_Priority470","created_utc":1710653961,"title":"Absolutely ","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"audiomuse1","created_utc":1710662512,"title":"Florida homeowners are losing their houses","num_comments":17,"description":""},{"author":"ExoGeniVI","created_utc":1710673730,"title":"Who is Fani Willis and why should I care?

A few have signed them into law.\n\nNow a string of legal challenges from conservative groups is overturning those laws \u2014 forcing every voter\u2019s records online,\u202fincluding their names, addresses and birthdates.\u202f\n\nOn February 19, the Voter Reference Foundation, a subsidiary of the Illinois-based nonprofit Restoration of America, sued Pennsylvania\u2019s election officials for the right to obtain and post the state\u2019s voter registration records. Two weeks earlier, Maine lost an appeal to protect its state voter records from being posted online. In 2022, New Mexico lost a similar case.\u202f\n\nThe suits have turned American voter records into a politically charged flashpoint \u2014 a contest between bipartisan public officials who want citizens to have a measure of protection for their personal information, and conservative groups that see \u201celection transparency\u201d as a goal that trumps privacy rights.\n\nEven for people who aren\u2019t actively doxxed, voter privacy concerns are a meaningful drag on civic participation. A Pew Research poll in 2016 found that 11 percent of unregistered voters chose not to register to vote because of privacy and security concerns. With 77 million unregistered voters in 2020, that\u2019s potentially more than 8 million Americans who aren\u2019t voting because of worries about their data being leaked.\u202f\n\nThe Voter Reference Foundation is behind the cases in Pennsylvania and New Mexico, while another election transparency group called the Public Interest Legal Foundation sued Maine. Both organizations are conservative-backed efforts that describe themselves as focused on election transparency and integrity.\u202fThe Voter Reference Foundation argues that restrictions on posting voter information online limits its free-speech rights to criticize election maintenance activities.\n\nThe Public Interest Legal Foundation has sued all over the country since 2012 for access to voter record rolls, and has falsely accused people of committing voter fraud in the past. The organization is led by J. Christian Adams, who previously served on Donald Trump\u2019s voter fraud commission.\u202f\n\nThe Voter Reference Foundation, started in 2021, is run by Gina Swoboda, a former Trump campaign official who was elected to chair the Arizona Republican Party in February.\u202f\u202f"},{"author":"foxinHI","created_utc":1710683483,"title":"Trump Says Some Migrants Are \u2018Not People\u2019 and Predicts a \u2018Blood Bath\u2019 if He Loses (Gift Article)","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1710685211,"title":"\u2018My soul is so tired\u2019: Stormy Daniels stands up to Maga hate in new film | Stormy Daniels","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"MarkWhittington","created_utc":1710687226,"title":"Biden\u2019s tax proposals would hurt commercial space","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"realplayer16","created_utc":1710690299,"title":"Trump Promises a 'Bloodbath' for the Country If He Doesn't Win Against Joe Biden in 2024, Vows 100% Tariff on Mexican Cars","num_comments":29,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1710691069,"title":"Authoritarians are playing to win.

But before she could unpack her boxes, critics launched an effort to recall her. ","num_comments":3,"description":">Almost as soon as I get into the car, District Attorney Pamela Price makes it clear that she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me, or at the very least she doesn\u2019t have time to. \u201cI have to get some stuff done,\u201d she says politely, picking up her phone to dial a colleague as her driver steers the black Chevy Tahoe through traffic toward Oakland, California. Price is running late for an event, and it\u2019s partly my fault: She left her last meeting without me and had to backtrack after her communications team reminded her that I was supposed to join the ride.\n\n>Price is tired of journalists. As one of the country\u2019s most progressive district attorneys and the first Black woman to hold the position in Alameda County, she\u2019s encountered extreme scrutiny since taking office in January 2023. She had campaigned to roll back mass incarceration, address racial disparities, and hold more police accountable, and won the race by a close margin, about 27,000 votes. But before she could unpack her boxes, critics launched an effort to recall her, funded primarily by a handful of wealthy hedge-fund and real estate investors. Price says they\u2019re spreading misinformation to stoke people\u2019s fears about crime, turning her into a scapegoat. And she thinks the media is amplifying their message, blaming her for social problems that existed long before she took office\u2014problems that her predecessor did not seem to face nearly as much condemnation for. \u201cThere\u2019s a double standard for progressive prosecutors,\u201d she told me earlier. \u201cNo one was looking at the [prior] DA and saying, \u2018What are you doing about this?\u2019 Now, everyone\u2019s looking.\u201d\n\n>Price is among a cadre of progressive DAs who are challenging conventional political wisdom about crime and punishment. This \u201cputs a unique target on their backs,\u201d says Insha Rahman, who leads the justice advocacy group Vera Action. Since 2017, lawmakers in at least 17 states have introduced bills to remove power from democratically elected progressive prosecutors. In 2022, not long before Price took office, rich businessmen funded a successful recall of San Francisco DA Chesa Boudin. Now some of the same financiers are attacking Price. In early March, her opponents said they submitted more than the 73,195 signatures needed to trigger a recall election (though the signatures have yet to be verified). This time, they have the sympathies of a group of mothers of color who are grieving shootings and believe Price hasn\u2019t punished the perpetrators harshly enough.\n\n>Price has, at times, shied away from correcting the record, wanting to focus instead on her job: prosecuting gun violence and robberies, looking into wrongful jail deaths, helping victims get services, hiring more diverse attorneys. \u201cWhat does justice look like? That\u2019s the job,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that job is not going to change if we\u2019re going through a crime wave or we\u2019re not\u2014I still have to do the job.\u201d\n\n>But her determination to focus on the work instead of fighting rumors has created an information vacuum that her opponents have been more than happy to fill. Price is \u201cwillfully fomenting a culture of violence,\u201d a press release for the recall campaign states: She has \u201ca total lack of regard for public safety.\u201d None of it, Price tells me, is true. But will she find a way to convince everyone?\n\n\u2026\n\n>Price\u2019s historic victory complicated the story national tabloids tried to sell after Boudin\u2019s ouster; it suggested that Bay Area voters still craved progressive justice reforms. \u201cShe is somebody who wants to correct the mistakes of the past,\u201d says Nicole Lee, executive director of the Urban Peace Movement, a racial justice group. Her first month in office, Price reopened several cases involving police shootings and in-custody deaths, and she soon set up a commission to improve mental health courts.\n\n>But her promise to shake up the system, at a time when people were seeing more news coverage of crime, set the stage for a backlash. Within weeks she saw a post on the app Nextdoor falsely alleging that she\u2019d bought televisions for the inmates at Santa Rita Jail. Other commenters were frustrated about plea deals that her office made for violent crimes, with punishments that they felt were too short. In February 2023, a Change.org petition began collecting signatures against Price, linking to some of these cases and claiming \u201cshe\u2019s out of control.\u201d In July, an official recall committee launched. When a recall campaign pops up that quickly, Boudin told me, \u201cit\u2019s clearly not about the policies or the management style,\u201d but \u201cabout refusing to accept the outcome of the election\u201d and making it hard for the DA to do her job.\n\n\u2026\n\n>When the Change.org petition against Price started in February 2023, Price didn\u2019t give it much thought. She\u2019d expected criticism, she told me, but she had bigger things to focus on than some online trolls. The office she\u2019d inherited was a mess\u2014literally, it needed to be cleaned, and attorneys were doing a lot of work on paper because the computer system was so antiquated. Complicating matters, many people in the agency had supported the campaign for Wiley, her opponent. (Some later accused her of firing them in retaliation; Price\u2019s spokesperson told me the DA\u2019s office does not comment on personnel matters.) \u201cWe were focused on the inside,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe really weren\u2019t paying attention to the people on the outside.\u201d\n\n>But the dissenting voices outside were getting louder. A local ABC affiliate published an interview with a departing prosecutor who said people would die because of Price\u2019s policies: \u201cWith each passing day, we\u2019re receiving new information about plea deals that favor criminals and leave victims of violent crime feeling like they haven\u2019t received justice,\u201d wrote the reporter, Dan Noyes. (He failed to explain that around the country, about 95 percent of cases resolve in plea deals that don\u2019t seek the maximum punishment.) \u201cEveryone is in danger,\u201d Oakland\u2019s NAACP branch, which counts Wiley as a member, would soon claim, adding that Price\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to charge and prosecute people\u2026created a heyday\u201d for criminals. After Delonzo Logwood, who committed murder at age 18, received a plea deal from Price\u2019s office in February 2023 that would cut his prison sentence to a fifth of what he\u2019d been facing, Price got death threats.\n\n>Price\u2019s supporters questioned why she wasn\u2019t defending herself more. One of her top spokespeople, Ryan LaLonde, soon resigned because he wanted her to respond more to her opponents in the press, but she often refused to, unhappy that some reporters had disrespected her as a Black woman. \u201cShe really just wanted to do her job and not be drawn into it,\u201d says her friend Polatnick. She shouldn\u2019t be \u201craising a ruckus,\u201d says Mister Phillips, an attorney in her office, \u201cbut there are people out there who are louder than her and they get press, and what they are saying is not always true.\u201d\n\n>Sometimes Price was criticized for decisions she hadn\u2019t even made yet. Last April, about 100 protesters gathered outside the county courthouse shouting, \u201cDo your job!\u201d and \u201cJustice for Jasper!\u201d In 2021, toddler Jasper Wu had been killed by a stray bullet in a gang battle on the freeway. Wu\u2019s family worried Price wouldn\u2019t punish the shooters harshly enough, especially after she instructed her office to limit the use of sentencing enhancements, a tool that can make prison sentences longer. At the time of the rally, Price\u2019s office was still examining the evidence. \u201cThe coverage of her work has speculated on what she will do, in ways that haven\u2019t proved to be her actual decisions,\u201d says Cristine Soto DeBerry, founder of the Prosecutors Alliance of California, who describes Price\u2019s policies as \u201cmeasured\u201d compared with those of other progressive DAs. \u201cWhen discretion is vested in the hands of the first elected Black woman in the county, the spotlight and the magnifying glass is zeroed in more intensely.\u201d\n\n>Ultimately, Price\u2019s office did not make Jasper\u2019s two alleged shooters eligible for life in prison without the possibility of parole, an option they\u2019d faced under DA O\u2019Malley. But the men did get charged with enhancements, and they are now facing 175 years to life in prison and 265 years to life.\n\n>There\u2019s a general lack of public understanding about how DAs handle cases and the extent to which their policies do or don\u2019t affect crime levels, Price tells me. \u201cEverybody\u2019s looking at me,\u201d she says, \u201cand they have no idea what I do. There\u2019s so much about this position that has never been discussed.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n>Price has some reason to tread cautiously with journalists. Compared with traditional prosecutors, progressive DAs anecdotally appear to be held to a different standard in the press and on social media, says Pamela Mejia at the nonprofit Berkeley Media Studies Group. In the first year of the pandemic, the murder rate in Boudin\u2019s San Francisco was roughly half that of Bakersfield, California, a Republican-led city with a more conservative DA. \u201cYet there is barely a whisper, let alone an outcry, over the stunning levels of murders\u201d in Bakersfield, the think tank Third Way found in a study examining the outsize attention on crime in Democratic cities. \u201cA lot of it is driven by police union and police department communication teams that are important sources for journalists,\u201d says Boudin. His moderate replacement in San Francisco, DA Brooke Jenkins, has not received nearly the same amount of negative press as he did, even though overdoses and some crimes rose after she emboldened cops to crack down on drug sales. \u201cJenkins gets a pass partly because she talks about crime in binary terms that appeal to moderates and Republicans,\u201d Chronicle columnist Justin Phillips wrote. \u201cPrice so far has proved incapable of doing this.\u201d\n\n>The scrutiny on Price is exacerbated, says the Urban Peace Movement\u2019s Lee, because of her race and gender, a trend that progressive DAs of color have seen nationally. Kim Gardner, the first Black circuit attorney in St. Louis, received letters calling her the n-word and a \u201ccunt\u201d before she resigned in 2023. Aramis Ayala, the first Black DA in Florida, got a noose in the mail after then-Gov. Rick Scott prohibited her from handling death penalty cases in 2017. In the Bay Area, recallers are also targeting Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao, who is Hmong American, and reformist Contra Costa DA Diana Becton, who is Black. \u201cPeople feel very, very comfortable discrediting her,\u201d Lee says of Price: \u201cI have been called every kind of black B; I\u2019ve been called a roach,\u201d Price told me. \u201cThe attacks are vicious: There are no boundaries when it comes to Black women.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n>Campaign filings showed that about $1 out of every $3 spent on the recall last year came from a single hedge-fund partner, Philip Dreyfuss, who also spent heavily to oust Boudin. He and the next four biggest donors\u2014real estate and tech investors Justin Osler, Isaac Abid, and Carl Bass, and real estate firm Holland Residential\u2014gave about half of all the funds raised in 2023. As of early February, the recall campaign had spent $2.2 million, dwarfing Price\u2019s resources. Much of the money went to SAFE, the group Grisham co-founded with Dreyfuss and Chinatown businessman Carl Chan, as well as to Dreyfuss\u2019 second group, Supporters of Recall Pamela Price, primarily for signature gathering.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019re having a moment in California politics where wealthy donors can purchase a spot on the ballot and redo an election result,\u201d says the Prosecutor Alliance\u2019s DeBerry. She says that nationally, progressive DAs tend to do well at the polls. Philadelphia\u2019s Larry Krasner, Chicago\u2019s Kim Foxx, and St. Louis\u2019 Kim Gardner were all reelected to second terms, as were dozens of other reformist prosecutors. Though Boudin remains one of the movement\u2019s biggest losses, he actually had more supporters vote for him in the recall election than they did during his original election. \u201cThe progressive prosecutor movement is vibrant and strong because it\u2019s advocating for changes that are popular with voters,\u201d he told me recently. But those changes can rile up Republican politicians or rich business execs who were faring well under the status quo: \u201cYou end up getting pushback from above, not from below.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n>Over the past five years, polls show that Americans have grown more worried about crime, regardless of whether their cities have become more dangerous. Nationally, reported rates of violence \u201cappear to be going down, but public perception is that people don\u2019t feel safe and that data doesn\u2019t necessarily feel meaningful for people,\u201d says Mejia at the Berkeley Media Studies Group. She cited a phenomenon called the \u201cmean world\u201d syndrome: When people consume a lot of news about crime, they become convinced the world around them is a dangerous place.\n\n>In 2022, she says, news outlets published significantly more stories about violence in California than they did just five years earlier, mirroring national media trends. Journalists are writing more about crime, says Vera\u2019s Rahman, in part because politicians are talking more about it; after New York City Mayor Eric Adams ran on a law-and-order platform in 2021, media mentions of the issue skyrocketed there, according to a Bloomberg analysis. In the Bay Area, relentless crime coverage adds to the unease some people feel when they see visible changes in their neighborhoods, after the pandemic amplified existing problems around poverty, substance abuse, and mental illness, leading to more homelessness and open-air drug use.\n\n\u2026\n\nMuch more information in full article"},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1710815454,"title":"Gun restrictions on defendants awaiting trial are constitutional, U.S. appeals court rules","num_comments":2,"description":"A federal appeals court ruled Monday that criminal defendants can be stripped of their right to handle firearms, affirming a lower court ruling and dealing a blow to gun rights advocates.\n\nThe 9th Circuit decision sided against two defendants who claimed that the government could not take away their firearms before they could be convicted of a crime.\n\nA three-judge panel disagreed, finding the restrictions \u201cconsistent with how courts have long balanced the constitutional rights of pretrial detainees and releasees with legitimate public safety and logistical considerations, and is consistent with our nation\u2019s long history of temporarily disarming criminal defendants facing serious charges and those deemed dangerous or unwilling to follow the law,\u201d Judge Gabriel Sanchez wrote in the opinion.\n\nThe two defendants both face serious criminal charges and brought suits separately.

Trump, is struggling to raise funds. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, independent of the outside groups, expects to raise and spend $2 billion as part of his re-election bid.\n\nThe pro-Biden outside money originates from nearly a dozen organizations that include climate groups, labor unions and traditional super PACs. There are left-wing groups like MoveOn and moderate Republicans like Republican Voters Against Trump.\n\nThe largest spenders so far are Future Forward, the super PAC blessed by the Biden campaign, which has reserved more than $250 million in television and digital advertising; the Service Employees International Union, which said last week that it would spend $200 million to back Mr. Biden and fellow Democrats; and American Bridge, the Democratic research organization that said in January that it planned to spend $140 million on an anti-Trump advertising campaign in battleground states.\n\nStephanie Schriock, the former president of Emily\u2019s List, the group that supports and funds Democratic women running for office, said she expected the amount of outside money backing Mr. Biden to reach $2.5 billion to $3 billion, with large sums to be spent on legal issues and get-out-the-vote efforts this fall.\n\nThe $1 billion in Democratic money pledged on Mr. Biden\u2019s behalf does not include an additional $239 million in advertising reservations made by Senate Majority PAC, the super PAC devoted to electing Senate Democrats.

Both Biden and Netanyahu have drawn \"red lines\" around an Israeli operation in the southern Gaza city, where more than one million displaced Palestinians are sheltering.\n\nThe Biden administration strongly opposes an Israeli operation in Rafah and has said it is concerned Israel doesn't have an implementable plan that will protect Palestinians. Netanyahu has said Israel must go into Rafah to eliminate Hamas.\n\nBiden caught Netanyahu by surprise when he proposed during their phone call on Monday that the prime minister send a delegation to Washington to talk about the Rafah operation. It was the first time the Israelis have heard about it, U.S. and Israeli officials told Axios.\n\nIn recent days, several alternatives to an immediate Israeli ground invasion of Rafah have been discussed inside the administration.\n\nU.S. officials said one idea is to delay a military operation in the city and focus on stabilizing the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza, where famine is \"imminent,\" according to a UN-backed report released Monday. This plan would also involve constructing shelters for civilians evacuated from Rafah. The goal would be to reduce the potential for massive civilian casualties in an invasion, one official said.\n\nThe idea had been discussed inside the administration for several days as a way to move to a more constructive path with the Israelis, two U.S. official said. The White House realized it is not enough to tell the Israelis what not to do but there is also a need to present a U.S. alternative, the U.S. officials said.\n\nAnother idea is to focus in the first stage on securing Egypt's side of its border with Gaza as part of a joint U.S.-Egypt-Israel plan to destroy tunnels under the border and create infrastructure to prevent arms smuggling into Gaza, U.S. officials say.\n\nOn Tuesday, Netanyahu said during a meeting with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that \"out of respect for the President\" he agreed to send a delegation to Washington so the administration can present Israel with its ideas \"especially on the humanitarian side.\"\n\nNetanyahu also said he is sending his confidants minister Ron Dermer and national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi to Washington early next week for the talks. An Israeli Defense Forces official in charge of humanitarian issues will travel with them. The delegation will not include IDF officers in charge of military planning of the operation in Rafah as the U.S. requested. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is also expected to travel to Washington separately next week for talks with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and other senior officials about the war in Gaza, Israeli and U.S. officials said."},{"author":"Royal-Indication-169","created_utc":1710886203,"title":"For Trump\u2019s sake, two GOP women go to war against their own sex","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"OkMine4705","created_utc":1710886633,"title":"Aww Nobody Is Listening To Mike Johnson's Calls For Unity","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Aggravating-Way-1874","created_utc":1710887506,"title":"House GOP leaders desperately plead with Republicans to stop campaigning against each other","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Recent-Struggle4646","created_utc":1710887756,"title":"Mark Levin 'Outraged' That GOP Billionaires Won't Pay Trump's Bond","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Kunphen","created_utc":1710887881,"title":"Trump\u2019s STUNNING ADMISSION is FAR WORSE Than No Cash\u2026","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"justin_quinnn","created_utc":1710887983,"title":"Zieglers sue to stop release of records gathered during criminal investigation","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"KmartRadio","created_utc":1710888492,"title":"I live in North Carolina and I'm in a Hickory NC group.

The anniversary events will also include a blitz of digital ads and events in the swing states Biden needs to win in November: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nBiden has long signaled that he plans to run on his health care record and go after his presumptive opponent, Donald Trump, for suggesting Republicans take another run at repealing Obamacare. But the plans, first shared with POLITICO, show the strategy kicking into a higher gear with the first public joint appearance with Obama since Biden\u2019s reelection campaign launched last year.\n\nAmid a wave of GOP attacks on immigration, inflation, crime and other issues, Democrats up and down the ballot are keen to campaign on their health care records as polling shows voters trust the party far more than Republicans on the issue.\n\nBiden plans to highlight policies that are \u201ctangible\u201d and that impact \u201cwhat people are going through in their lives every day,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said \u2014 from the beefed-up ACA subsidies enacted during his first year in office to the record-high Obamacare enrollment the country reached in January.

Nine more red and purple states have also expanded Medicaid under the law since then, which GOP lawmakers acknowledge makes repeal even more politically dicey."},{"author":"SatisfactionFun4452","created_utc":1710902504,"title":"SCOTUS Rules Insurrectionist Can't Run For Office?

Some Republicans have also struggled to answer questions about whether they consider embryos to be people \u2014 with some taking heat from anti-abortion groups.\n\nDemocratic governors are also emphasizing the importance governors play in some states in making judicial appointments. The Democratic Governors Association recently launched the Power to Appoint fund, which is focused on helping elect Democratic governors who can be in position to appoint in the event there is a judicial vacancy. Since the fall of Dobbs, matters of reproductive rights are largely decided at the state level \u2014 with state supreme courts becoming the ultimate arbiter of what is legal.\n\nMeanwhile, national Republicans issued a memo commanding their candidates to avoid the topic on the campaign trail, owing to IVF\u2019s extreme popular support.

In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden highlighted actions in the food, health care and housing markets. High housing costs are a particular priority for the administration, with Biden calling out rental prices, saying, \u201cFor millions of renters, we\u2019re cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents.\u201d The president was in Nevada on Tuesday, discussing actions to fight \u201crent gouging among corporate landlords.\u201d\n\nWhile the RealPage probes could yield a traditional price-fixing lawsuit, they are also emblematic of the Justice Department\u2019s increased focus on information-sharing agreements across the economy.

The administration is backing a plan to pressure cities and other localities to relax zoning restrictions that in many cases hinder affordable housing construction.\n\nThat recommendation is part of a new administration deep dive into a housing crisis, decades in the making, that is hindering the president\u2019s chances for a second term. The proposals, included in the annual Economic Report of the President, could serve as a blueprint for a major housing push if Biden wins a second term.\n\nThe report includes a suite of moves meant to reduce the cost of renting or buying a home, while encouraging local governments to change zoning laws to allow development of more affordable housing.\n\nJared Bernstein, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, added that administration officials believed many local leaders were encouraging a bigger federal role in zoning reform \u2014 which can help override objections from local groups that oppose development. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re kicking through more of an open door now than we ever have before,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration has acknowledged that it has limited power over local zoning rules, which tend to dictate the design and density of homes in particular neighborhoods. Most of the president\u2019s recommendations for expanding supply involve using the federal budget as a carrot to encourage local governments to allow more building \u2014 including adding low-income housing and smaller starter homes.\n\nThe focus on housing, and the endorsement of a comprehensive set of policies to increase its supply and affordability, could serve as a blueprint for a potentially bipartisan effort on the issue if Biden wins reelection. It could also add momentum to a housing reform movement that is well underway in state legislatures around the country."},{"author":"mchantloup5","created_utc":1711046586,"title":"No brokered convention ","num_comments":1,"description":"These days, when I see \"A New York Times\/Siena College poll found that ...\" I know we're seeing another volley in Mr. Sulzberger's misguided (and utterly stupid) campaign to pressure Biden to step aside.

The fund was at the center of why some Senate Republicans blocked the PACT Act's passage before veterans staged a 24\/7 protest on the steps of the Capitol.\n\nAmong the issues that VA officials said they have with Bost's proposal is that the caps would be $17 billion less than VA budget projections are currently estimating the fund will receive in the coming years.\n\nThe caps could also make it hard to add conditions to the list of illnesses presumed to be caused by military service, Rychalski said. The PACT Act designated certain illnesses as presumed to be linked to military service, but it also created a streamlined process to add more ailments to the VA's presumptive list in the future."},{"author":"gent4you","created_utc":1711068693,"title":"Loyal Dem here,,,, Please explain why this is so important?

But he\u2019s coming back for it.\u201d \n\nThe messages are played over an image of a heart monitor that eventually flatlines. \n\nAs president, Trump was just one vote away from repealing the law and has said he wants to try again. \n\n\u201cIf he succeeds \u2026 45 million Americans could lose their health insurance,\u201d the ad said. \u201cAnd you could be one of them.\u201d \n\nThe campaign said the ad will run on digital platforms including Meta, YouTube, and connected TV in English and Spanish across battleground states. \n\nIn addition to the ad, the campaign is holding a digital rally this weekend with former President Obama and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The national call is meant to \u201cmobilize supporters and volunteers around protecting the ACA from Trump\u2019s attacks,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is also running battleground state digital ads slamming Trump for his ACA repeal efforts.  \n\nThe ads will appear as digital homepage takeovers of local newspaper websites in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin.  \n\nThe Biden campaign and Democratic allies have enthusiastically jumped into a fight with Trump over ObamaCare, after the presumptive GOP nominee has floated taking another run at repealing the law.   \n\nMore than 40 million people have health insurance through ObamaCare, and the law is more popular than ever. Biden campaign officials believe preserving it is a major political issue, as sign-ups for 2024 coverage hit a record 21.3 million.  \n\nBiden and Democrats have long felt health care is a winning issue for them, and the president has leaned into the pocketbook issue of lowering people\u2019s costs amid broad concerns about the economy.   \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take this progress for granted. Extreme MAGA Republicans have voted over 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Just this week, Trump\u2019s allies in the House proposed a budget that would gut this life-saving legislation,\u201d Biden said in a statement Friday, referring to the Republican Study Committee\u2019s budget proposal. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hyperbole to say that affordable health care for millions of people is on the line in November. I am more determined than ever to beat back MAGA Republican attacks and make health care a right and not a privilege in America,\u201d Biden said.  \n\nThe Biden campaign is also trying to use Trump\u2019s \u201care you better off\u201d argument against him. \n\nOn Friday, Biden\u2019s team highlighted a clip from a press conference from exactly four years ago in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Trump said he wanted to \u201cterminate\u201d ObamaCare and reiterated his support for a lawsuit seeking to end the law.  \n\n\u201cRipping away health care from millions of Americans is always a bad idea, but Trump\u2019s attempts in March of 2020 \u2013 when thousands of Americans were dying \u2013 couldn\u2019t have been worse timing,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cDonald Trump and his campaign keep asking the country if we are better off now than we were four years ago.

She visited a home outside San Juan to show how a program funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is helping rebuild and repair homes. \n\nThe administration is trying to sell what it says are its accomplishments on the island as the Puerto Rican diaspora on the U.S. mainland gains more political clout ahead of what\u2019s expected to be a tight presidential race.

It is also running ads on local radio stations on the island and across the U.S. targeting Puerto Ricans and Latinos more broadly.\n\nThe rising number of Puerto Ricans in central Florida \u2014 a key area in a perennial battleground state \u2014 has drawn plenty of attention from campaigns in previous election cycles. But with Florida leaning further to the right in recent years, Democrats are placing a greater emphasis on Puerto Rican voters in the more narrowly divided Pennsylvania in 2024.\n\nWhile Philadelphia has long been home to a sizable Puerto Rican population, Democratic operatives are also eyeing other cities in Pennsylvania, such as Allentown, Scranton, Lancaster and Erie."},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1711189281,"title":"Harris to announce gun control measures on visit to Parkland, Fla.","num_comments":0,"description":"Vice President Harris will make two announcements on gun violence prevention efforts Saturday in Parkland, Fla., where 14 students and three staff members were killed in a school shooting in 2018.\n\nHarris is set to meet with families of those killed in the mass shooting and will visit Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School with them, along with Rep.

The plans are part of a competition for EPA funding \u2014 called Climate Pollution Reduction Grants \u2014 worth up to a half-billion dollars.\n\nThat\u2019s a transformative sum for most states. The competition also doubles as one of the first contests in the invisible primary to succeed Biden as standard bearer for the Democratic Party. There, climate action promises to be a critical yardstick as candidates vie for progressive votes as well as support from key party power brokers: labor unions, energy industry donors and environmental groups.\n\nFor their part, Republican White House hopefuls already have treated the program as a way to bolster their conservative bonafides. Five governors in the country declined to participate in the program. One was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who quit the Republican presidential primary in January. And two others \u2014 South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds \u2014 have angled for a spot on a Republican presidential ticket.\n\nNow, it\u2019s Democrats\u2019 turn to use the program to burnish their climate records.\n\nAdvocates and experts are combing through the plans to discern which ones show the most ambition. And the competitive nature of the program \u2014 only a few states will land the biggest grants \u2014 means the winning governors will get a unique opportunity to implement their vision, along with bragging rights over the others."},{"author":"ExtraTouch6414","created_utc":1711404626,"title":"GOP Rep.

After the news broke, it was met with a repudiation by a bipartisan coalition in Congress, who noted in a letter that the move undermined legislation implemented in 2022 to boost the division\u2019s funding. In the letter, the members warned that the cuts would \u201champer the ability of the Antitrust Division to utilize those additional funds to enhance its enforcement activities\u201d at consumers\u2019 expense. \n\nUnfortunately, the House ultimately voted to advance the cuts as part of a consolidated budget bill agreement.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), one of Capitol Hill\u2019s strongest antitrust advocates, slammed the cuts, noting in a Senate speech that \u201cUnbeknownst to us, they just took the money and ran\u201d at the division\u2019s expense. In the following days, the Biden administration signaled it would work with lawmakers to undo the funding cut, which was welcomed by pro-competition advocates. Americans everywhere should demand that Congress undo the stealth effort to undermine antitrust enforcement and give the division the funding it deserves.\n\nWith less than eight months until Americans go to the polls, it was a wise choice for Biden to highlight the administration\u2019s pro-competition agenda in the State of the Union. With economic concerns a top priority among voters this election season, it\u2019s both good policy and good politics to emphasize the administration\u2019s work to rein in corporate monopolies. Measures like the White House\u2019s recently announced \u201cstrike force\u201d against illegal pricing give Biden an opportunity to present voters with a positive vision for America\u2019s economic future.\n\nBut strong antitrust enforcement requires more than strong rhetoric: it means that antitrust agencies must have the needed resources to take monopolistic actors to task. For this reason, Congress must roll back the cuts to the Antitrust Division\u2019s budget and give enforcers the tools they need to police anti-competitive behavior.

It outlines what New Dems and President Biden have already done to expand affordable housing, and provides a framework for what we still have to do to address the housing market moving forward. \n\nThe action plan focuses on five major themes: boosting the construction of homes, removing permitting and zoning barriers to construction, expanding federal financing support and rental assistance, growing the construction workforce and improving data collection to better track figures like pricing, eviction rates, homelessness and more.\n\nThrough more than 20 commonsense policy recommendations, the action plan will decisively meet the housing crisis through legislation, federal agency actions and partnerships with the private sector and state and local governments. \n\nThis includes recommendations like passing the YIMBY Act \u2014 a bipartisan, New Dem-led bill that would streamline home construction by amending outdated permitting and zoning laws \u2014 and reallocating American Rescue Plan funds to provide emergency assistance to hard-working families at risk of eviction. The action plan also calls for strong public-private collaborations to tackle supply chain disruptions and housing materials shortages, and innovative immigration policy solutions that would surge much-needed workers to the construction industry.\n\nWith the New Dem Housing Action Plan, we\u2019re at the table ready to work with any lawmaker on either side of the aisle on this issue, because everyone deserves to have a roof over their head without going broke.

Alito rejected the Biden administration\u2019s argument that the law is obsolete \u2014 it has not been applied in nearly a century \u2014 with the conservative justice insisting that Food and Drug Administration officials should have accounted for the law when expanding access to mifepristone by mail in 2021.\n\nSome experts and Biden officials fear Alito and Thomas are planning to write a separate opinion focused solely on the Comstock Act, arguing that the law remains viable and providing legal cover to a future administration that seeks to invoke it.\n\nFederal courts have shown willingness to engage with that argument. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who ruled in April to suspend FDA approval of mifepristone, relied in part on the Comstock Act, saying the meaning of the law is clear from the text. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit did not address Comstock when it ruled to restrict access to mifepristone in August.\n\nFormer president and current GOP candidate Donald Trump has not commented on the Comstock Act. But some of his conservative supporters and members of the antiabortion movement have pushed for him to invoke the law if he returns to the presidency."},{"author":"CommanderKiddie148","created_utc":1711495529,"title":"AOC Delivers One Of The Greatest Speeches Of Her Career","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Ok-Recording-6697","created_utc":1711495868,"title":"The Utter Ridiculousness of \u2018Trump Bibles\u2019","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1711496275,"title":"Mississippi Republican: \"I will NOT vote for Trump this year\" | Republican Voters Against Trump","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Ok_Response8678","created_utc":1711496668,"title":"Donald Trump Is Now Hawking \u2018God Bless the USA\u2019 Bibles","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Ok_Response8678","created_utc":1711496834,"title":"The GOP Wants You to Be Terrified of a Black Woman President","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"OkRide4356","created_utc":1711497540,"title":"'None of that is true': James Comer fact-checked over letter begging for cash","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"OkRide4356","created_utc":1711497622,"title":"Analysis | James Comer makes his final anti-Biden push \u2026 to prospective donors","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"SmileSea1516","created_utc":1711498475,"title":"Analysis | An all-American Bible \u2014 with a cut of the sales going to Trump","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"AdvancedHat7630","created_utc":1711499451,"title":"How to buy a friend and business partner with just $900,307 of taxpayer money and six easy steps","num_comments":0,"description":"Sorry for the god-awful formatting.

Trump\u2019s campaign promises an aggressive play for Michigan as part of a robust swing-state strategy.\n\nBut, at least for now, those promises appear to be mostly talk. The Trump campaign and its partners at the Republican National Committee haven\u2019t yet made significant general election investments in the state, according to Michigan Republican Party Chairman Pete Hoekstra. The national committee, he said, hasn\u2019t transferred any money to the state party to help bolster its operations heading into the general election. There are no specific programs in place to court voters of color. And there\u2019s no general election field staff in place.\n\nIt\u2019s much the same in presidential battleground states across the country, according to Republican operatives and party officials involved in campaign planning elsewhere.\n\nWidely praised for its professionalism and effectiveness throughout the primary phase of the 2024 election, Trump\u2019s political operation has been slow to pivot toward the general election in the weeks after executing a hostile takeover of the Republican Party\u2019s national political machinery. In fact, the former president\u2019s team has rolled back plans under previous leaders to add hundreds of staff and dozens of new minority-outreach centers in key states without offering a clear alternative.\n\nIndeed, just six months before the first early votes are cast in the general election between Trump and Biden, Trump\u2019s Republican Party has little general election infrastructure to speak of.\n\nOfficials on the ground in top swing states are not panicking, but the disparity with the Biden campaign is stark.\n\nThis month alone, Biden opened 100 new offices and added more than 350 new staffers in swing states from Arizona to Georgia to Pennsylvania, according to campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa. That\u2019s in addition to the Democratic president\u2019s existing battleground-state staff of 100 that was already in place.\n\nFacing internal pushback on some of the cuts, Lara Trump has vowed that the committee\u2019s half-dozen existing community centers would remain open. But it\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s team will follow through on McDaniel\u2019s plans to open an additional 40 community centers in the coming months. Amid such optimism, however, there is also a deep sense of uncertainty as Trump\u2019s team rewrites the party\u2019s 2024 battleground-state strategy after burning the previous playbook."},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1711548895,"title":"Trump loves to play the victim \u2014 NY appeals court bailout shows he's the most coddled person alive","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1711549547,"title":"Trump evokes more anger and fear from Democrats than Biden does from Republicans, AP-NORC poll shows","num_comments":7,"description":"Many Americans are unenthusiastic about a November rematch of the 2020 presidential election.

But the latest poll results suggest Trump has not yet maximized the potential benefits of those attacks \u2014 or perhaps that they simply have a lower yield for him.\n\nBiden sometimes turns his version of the argument into a humorous quip he used often in 2020, when he was vying to unseat Trump: \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.\u201d\n\nIndeed, that is what resonates with reluctant Democrats and some independents."},{"author":"EmilyEKOSwimmer","created_utc":1711550961,"title":"Elon Musk, Trump and the Stupidity of the Right\/Republicans.","num_comments":1,"description":"Don\u2019t know if this is the right place to post this. \n\nThe right wing worships Elon Musk, they believe him to be some free speech warrior when he is not.

The mass disenrollments are happening for the first time since the pandemic, prompted by the expiration last April of a Covid-era policy meant to prevent vulnerable people from losing coverage amid the health crisis.\n\nBiden health officials have insisted there\u2019s only so much they can do to limit coverage losses, since Medicaid is administered by individual states. In the states that have accepted federal help with their unwinding, the administration said, the rate of Medicaid recipients who had their coverage auto-renewed has surged.\n\nBut the decision to extend the deadline for finding new Obamacare plans represents a fresh effort to prevent more people from going uninsured, and an acknowledgment that the disenrollment process is taking longer than anticipated.\n\nThe shift also means the new deadline will overlap with the Nov. 1 start of Obamacare\u2019s annual open enrollment, eliminating what would have been a three-month gap between the end of the special sign-up period and the beginning of the general process for anyone seeking Obamacare plans. That change, officials hope, will make for a smoother transition that ensures more people stay enrolled.\n\nIn tandem with the extended deadline, HHS\u2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it\u2019s also issuing a series of new guides aimed at further aiding states in renewing Medicaid recipients\u2019 coverage and providing resources for organizations that help people navigate the renewal process."},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1711625026,"title":"GOP plans for Medicaid cuts could face backlash","num_comments":4,"description":"Former President Trump's recent promise not to cut entitlement programs is notably silent on Medicaid \u2014 but GOP ambitions for shrinking the safety-net health care program could risk backlash similar to the party's Obamacare repeal debacle.\n\nThe Republican Study Committee, an influential group of House conservatives, released a budget last week that calls for converting Medicaid from an open-ended entitlement into block grants.\n\nThe Project 2025 plan from the Heritage Foundation also calls for caps on Medicaid spending.\n\nStrong resistance from the health industry \u2014 and even some Republican governors worried about the impact in their states \u2014 helped sink a Republican proposal to cap Medicaid funding during the failed 2017 ACA repeal effort.\n\nThe ACA and its Medicaid expansion has only grown more ingrained since then, and there are signs that GOP opposition in the 10 holdout states is starting to soften.\n\nPresident Biden, meanwhile, has boasted about Medicaid expansion enrollment as he makes health care a big focus of his reelection effort.\n\nToday's GOP is further right than than the one that abandoned ACA repeal in 2017.\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed vague interest in revisiting the ACA, which could mean changes to the Medicaid expansion.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the closest thing the GOP has to a vulnerable Senate incumbent.\n\nFlorida, where Bold PAC is working with Florida Freedom PAC, is also host to key House races for the CHC, including the reelection bid of Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.).\n\nTurnout is likely to be a key factor in Soto\u2019s effort, whose constituency includes a large part of central Florida\u2019s Puerto Rican population, a key demographic that Democrats need to win over if they want to make a comeback in the Sunshine State.\n\nThough national Democrats have become wary of investing in Florida, as Republicans have turned the perennial swing state reliably red, Latino organizations like Bold PAC have kept investments in the state.\n\nBold PAC\u2019s kickoff, an initial six-figure effort that\u2019s scheduled to precede other investments throughout the country, will also feature an alliance with Somos PAC Texas, the local branch of a Super PAC that featured heavily in Cortez Masto\u2019s reelection effort in 2022.\n\nIn Texas, Bold PAC will focus on a series of House races that could determine that chamber\u2019s composition, and whose competitive nature could alter statewide calculations, for instance by driving Latino voter turnout in November in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nTurnout in that region is often heavier in May, with voters more involved in local elections like school boards but voting patterns could be shifting with newly-competitive House races \u2013 and strategic mobilization investments."},{"author":"Warm-Inflation2152","created_utc":1711634928,"title":"Birds of a feather flock together","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Austin4rep","created_utc":1711635423,"title":"Just remember I tryed.. this is the last you will hear from me.. goodbye \ud83d\udc4b ","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1711637931,"title":"Scoop: House Democrats grow their GOP target list for 2024","num_comments":0,"description":"House Democrats are adding four more candidates to their \"Red to Blue\" program as they attempt to flip enough Republican-held seats to take the House majority, Axios has learned.\n\nAll four candidates are in districts President Biden won in 2020 \u2013 a sign that Democrats are doubling down on a strategy of trying to ride Biden's coattails in November.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's list includes three candidates challenging Republican incumbents and one running for an open seat vacated by Rep.

The details are expected to be released later this year. Plus, debt cancellations under existing programs are ongoing, and a repayment plan launched last year will make it easier for many current and future borrowers to repay their debt.\n\nThe Trump administration made it harder for borrowers to qualify for some forgiveness programs.\n\nOne such program provides debt relief for borrowers who can demonstrate that their college misled them in some way \u2013 by inflating job placement rates, for example. DeVos stalled the processing of claims made under the program, known as borrower defense to repayment, as she sought to rewrite the regulation, allowing a backlog of more than 100,000 claims to build up.\n\nShe also changed the cancellation calculation so that some borrowers were only eligible for partial relief. DeVos was even held in contempt of court for allowing the Education Department to continue collecting on some of those debts.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, has reversed that partial relief calculation and is chipping away at the backlog. So far, he\u2019s canceled $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers through the borrower defense program for people who went to schools like the now-defunct, for-profit Corinthian Colleges.\n\nThe Trump administration also called for ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which cancels student debt for eligible public-sector workers who have made 10 years of qualifying monthly payments. It was eliminated from Trump\u2019s proposed federal budget all four years he was in office. Congress never adopted the proposal.\n\nBiden has expanded PSLF eligibility and is conducting a recount of past payments to fix any past servicing errors and make sure borrowers get credit for every payment they\u2019ve made.\n\nBefore Biden took office, just 7,000 people had ever received debt relief under the program.

Laurel Lee (R-Fla.), the only House Republican from DeSantis\u2019 state to endorse the Florida governor in the primary, reveals a campaign with little interest in courting his former rivals and their supporters. But as President Joe Biden makes a play for Nikki Haley voters who might be reluctant to back Trump, Republicans are starting to nudge the former president to at least try to tone it down.\n\nThey\u2019re concerned about a rerun of the hair-pulling past \u2014 where GOP candidates in battleground races are constantly challenged to answer for their presumptive nominee\u2019s more erratic and boisterous statements.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), another former DeSantis backer, told POLITICO that Trump\u2019s scorched-earth approach to Lee risks turning off some voters who might otherwise favor him.\n\nTrump is unlikely to heed such warnings to pivot to a more consistent general election message. So far this month, he has said that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats \u201chate\u201d their religion and described some migrants as \u201cnot people.\u201d\n\nBut the fact that Hill Republicans are even attempting to refocus him, underscored by nearly 20 interviews with lawmakers and aides, illustrates their real worries about a 2024 cycle where their electoral fates are inescapably tied to the man at the top of the ticket.\n\nAtop of the list of topics some Republicans want Trump to avoid: his attempts to revise the violent history of the Capitol attack by his supporters and his description of people convicted of riot-related crimes as \u201cpatriots.\u201d\n\nThose sorts of questions are the stuff of nightmares for vulnerable House Republicans and Senate hopefuls looking to flip seats in battleground states. Trump\u2019s confrontational style has never fully rubbed off on his party; Republicans often succeed in battleground states by running more conventional candidates \u2014 who still have to respond to nearly everything Trump does once they offer him their support."},{"author":"WoodpeckerRemote7050","created_utc":1711887195,"title":"Weekend Update: Trump Selling $60 Bibles, Francis Scott Key Bridge Colla...","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Ok_Corner417","created_utc":1711887750,"title":"Republican Lawmakers Want to Ban Mifepristone, aka abortion pill & RU486.

When the NAR agreed to be more transparent about commissions and stop asserting that home buyers do not pay for any services, the Trump DOJ ended its investigation.\n\nIn July 2021, the Biden DOJ withdrew from the settlement, arguing that it did not address the fundamental problem and prohibited a \u201cbroader investigation of NAR rules and conduct to proceed without restriction\u201d in the future. The NAR\u2019s claim that the Biden DOJ does not have the authority to reopen a probe closed by the Trump DOJ is now making its way through the courts.\n\nIn November 2023, a court in Missouri found the NAR guilty of fixing commission fees and imposed a fine of $1.8 billion. With the clock ticking on other suits and the DOJ in hot pursuit, the NAR agreed in mid-March in essence to the terms laid down by the Biden DOJ: a \u201cdecoupling\u201d in which sellers no longer determine commissions for the agents of buyers. \n\nAt a time when housing is expensive and in short supply, this settlement, if approved, will be a game changer. More than sufficient reason for President Biden to draw a clear contrast with the sweetheart deal offered by the Trump DOJ.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans and Democrats have presented their 2025 budget proposals, even more evidence of priorities that are far apart. The Republican Study Committee, which includes 80 percent of GOP House members, endorsed the Life at Conception Act, budgets cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and increase in the retirement age without specific details on the age or impact on some 95 programs that provide different benefits depending on the age of the individual. Trump continues to give mixed signals about whether he supports or opposes cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Trump recently suggested, with some equivocation, that he\u2019s open to a 15-week federal ban on abortion.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s priorities include unequivocal support for a woman\u2019s right to choose whether or not to have an abortion; empowering the government to continue negotiations with pharmaceutical companies to reduce the prices of drugs and cap out-of-pocket costs for some of them, as it has for insulin; limiting child care expenses for most families; providing universal pre-K and Head Start; appropriating substantial funds for nutrition programs and an increase in the supply of affordable housing; and completion of hundreds of projects across the country funded in the bipartisan infrastructure bill \u2014 which was opposed by his predecessor.\n\nThese days, hyperpartisanship, media silos and the politics of personality contribute to misinformation and ignorance about issues that matter. And so, in 2024, it\u2019s essential that candidates provide clear, concrete and compelling explanations of what they and their opponent have and haven\u2019t done, what they plan to do and what\u2019s at stake. And voters should take the time to fact-check and compare these claims before making their decisions.\n\nDemocracy requires nothing less.\n\n"},{"author":"Horatiohornblowers","created_utc":1711893139,"title":"Potty mouth president: 3 takeaways on Trump's 'bloodbath' rhetoric","num_comments":22,"description":""},{"author":"realplayer16","created_utc":1711896034,"title":"\u2018The Bible does not need Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement\u2019","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"bivalverights","created_utc":1711896982,"title":"What do you think are the most effective ways to donate\/get involved in the 2024 federal elections?","num_comments":36,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1711897829,"title":"Congressional Dems Flirt With Heading Off Supreme Court On Mifepristone","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"jpcapone","created_utc":1711898245,"title":"\u2018Bullies\u2019: Biden effigy showcases a Johnson County Republican Party shaped by Trump era","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"realplayer16","created_utc":1711899781,"title":"Republican admits impeachment probe hasn't found any crime by Joe Biden","num_comments":47,"description":""},{"author":"CarrollCounty","created_utc":1711900919,"title":"Dark Money, GOP Turning New Hampshire into Florida, Texas of the North","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1711901800,"title":"Democrats hope Biden could get a boost from down-ballot races under Wisconsin's new legislative map","num_comments":1,"description":"New legislative districts adopted last month erase Republican advantages that gave the GOP dominance of the Wisconsin Assembly even as Democrats won 14 of the past 17 statewide elections. Democrats think they can now compete for a majority, but also that invigorated legislative campaigns can help turn out votes for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in November.\n\nThe Democrats argue there will be renewed personal attention to neighborhoods in small towns, suburbs and rural areas that had been part of GOP-heavy legislative seats but are now in more competitive districts. Those districts were seen as not worth the effort before, when Democrats\u2019 only hope was to stave off veto-proof GOP majorities. Now, they will get more campaign staff and volunteers to drive turnout.\n\nWisconsin is also among a half-dozen battleground states where Democrats are defending Senate seats in hopes of protecting their 51-49 majority. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, running for a third term, is likely to face millionaire businessman Eric Hovde who faces only nominal Republican opposition in the Aug. 13 primary.\n\nBaldwin agrees that she could benefit from \u201creverse coattails\u201d of legislative races. Previous districts \u201cwere so gerrymandered, which meant that there were whole swaths of Wisconsin where there weren\u2019t competitive races,\u201d she said.\n\nOf the Assembly\u2019s 99 seats, about half remain reasonably safe bets for Republicans. Democrats, who now hold 35 seats, have a better shot in 15 new districts. Some of those districts are on the outskirts of the Minnesota Twin Cities metro area in northwest Wisconsin and around Eau Claire to the northeast, both Democratic-leaning areas. Others are in the vote-rich Fox River Valley, including around Green Bay, where Trump plans to headline a rally on Tuesday.\n\nEven if Democrats fall short of the Assembly majority, Wikler figures that more aggressive canvassing for legislative candidates could identify people willing to vote Democratic in top-of-the-ticket races that have been tight in recent years."},{"author":"Randomlynumbered","created_utc":1711902285,"title":"Barack Obama Tells Voters Why He Picked Joe Biden for VP, and How It Applies Now","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"shallah","created_utc":1711906256,"title":"How the Biden operation mobilized right after the Baltimore bridge collapsed - POLITICO","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"PositiveRest6445","created_utc":1711906524,"title":"It must be defeated.

They\u2019re now laying the groundwork for a yearslong fight to curb in vitro fertilization.\n\nSince the Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children, the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups have been strategizing how to convince not just GOP officials but evangelicals broadly that they should have serious moral concerns about fertility treatments like IVF and that access to them should be curtailed.\n\nThey plan to appeal to evangelical denominations and their leaders to take a firm stance that IVF as practiced in the U.S. destroys human life. That, they hope, will reshape how conservative Christians \u2014 and in turn, the officials they elect \u2014 view the issue, just as it did on abortion. Ultimately, it could lead to laws that create a patchwork of IVF access in the United States, where the procedure is more accessible in liberal states and more limited in conservative ones.\n\nOrganizations including Heritage, former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s group Advancing American Freedom, and the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s public advocacy-focused Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission have worked behind the scenes over the last few weeks to distribute talking points, circulate policy recommendations and educate Republican officials and their staff about their ethical concerns with how IVF is commonly practiced in the United States.\n\nThe groups are not advocating banning IVF but want new restrictions that would significantly curtail access to the procedure, such as imposing more regulations on fertility clinics, limiting the number of embryos that can be created or transferred to the uterus at one time, and banning pre-implantation genetic testing, which they argue allows parents to discriminate against their embryos on the basis of sex, disabilities like Down Syndrome or other factors.\n\nAt the same time, they have been having conversations within their conservative Christian circles that have revealed how much work they need to do to convince evangelicals that there are ethical problems with the procedure. Most evangelical denominations have not taken firm stances on restricting fertility services like IVF."},{"author":"Ok_Corner417","created_utc":1711973887,"title":"How Anti-Vaccine Activists and the Far Right are Trying to Build a Parallel Economy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Cheap_Coffee","created_utc":1711973957,"title":"Cesar Chavez\u2019s Family Criticizes R.F.K.

The proposed amendment will put the abortion question on the ballot below voters\u2019 choices for president, Senate and other down-ballot races right as voters weigh the impact of the DeSantis-backed restrictions.\n\nWith abortion now front and center in Florida, Trump will face numerous political attacks on the issue from the Biden campaign and questions about what he thinks voters \u2014 including himself, a Florida resident \u2014 should do about the amendment.\n\nThe same is true for Sen.

Now, 80 of 90 DoDEA schools will host the universal program, with enrollment opened for school starting this fall.\n\nThe initiative, fueled by $94 million in a defense spending bill passed by Congress last month, is open to all children eligible to attend DoDEA schools who will be 4 years old by Sept. 1. It will follow the widely used early childhood development \"Creative Curriculum.\"\n\nThe 10 schools that will not offer universal pre-K are in the process of undergoing significant renovations or new construction to accommodate future students, Griffin said, adding that DoD schools must adhere to certain facility requirements for hosting elementary school students. Those schools include four elementary schools at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; one at Fort Novosel, Alabama; and five additional schools across Europe, including four in Germany and one in Kleine Brogel, Belgium.\n\nThe schools that will offer universal pre-K will begin the program 10 days after the start of the regular school year for older students. Griffin said the delayed start will allow additional time for pre-K teacher professional development, and will let teachers and families schedule one-on-one meetings to help children ease into the change.\n\nDoDEA is working to add 500 jobs to support the program, including 250 teachers and 250 teaching aides. The student-to-teacher ratio for the program is set at 18 students for every one teacher, with a teaching aide. Teaching aides are \"paraprofessionals\" and are not required to have a teaching degree or license."},{"author":"ThaneOfCawdorrr","created_utc":1712970581,"title":"The bothsiderism is SO RIDICULOUS","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"ThaneOfCawdorrr","created_utc":1712970751,"title":"LA Times Headline: \"TRUMP'S UNTRUTHS PILE UP.

Joining Forces is a White House initiative to support military families.\n\nThe memorandum aims to improve the Domestic Employees Teleworking Overseas (DETO) program, as required by President Joe Biden\u2019s June 2023 executive order outlining steps to enhance economic prospects for military and veterans spouses, caregivers and survivors.\n\nThe policy change will address many of the State Department\u2019s concerns about residential security requirements for federal employees working overseas, Casey said. If successful, the update would expand military spouses\u2019 opportunities to earn income and avoid massive work-related expenses they may incur when trying to telework from abroad.\n\nAll federal employees are prohibited from teleworking overseas without approval from their agency and the State Department. But a number of military spouses who have moved overseas on permanent change-of-station orders have been denied the ability to work for a federal agency overseas under the DETO program, or have seen those agreements rescinded \u2014 costing tens of thousands of dollars in lost wages."},{"author":"Free_Swimming","created_utc":1712977209,"title":"Fox and right wing media try to cope with the unpopularity of Republican's abortion bans","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"aceneverdone","created_utc":1712979487,"title":"GOP Senate candidate in Montana builds campaign on once-secret Navy exploits","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"AceCombat9519","created_utc":1712980878,"title":"The CDC just killed another right-wing Covid vaccine conspiracy theory","num_comments":17,"description":""},{"author":"AceCombat9519","created_utc":1712981565,"title":"Big Lie 2.0: Johnson joins Trump to concoct new false narrative for 2024","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CBRyder929","created_utc":1712983443,"title":"Why do conservatives not want background checks?","num_comments":180,"description":"Having disputes with them over this, why are they so paranoid that the government will come to their doors and take their guns because whatever reason they come up with?

Idaho was thrust into the national culture war debate again this week when the Supreme Court allowed state officials to temporarily enforce a ban on gender-affirming care, reinvigorating opposition to the law that was passed last year.\n\nIt\u2019s also not just Idaho. More Democrats than usual are running in states with GOP-dominated legislatures like Tennessee, Iowa and North Carolina. Democrats have made gains in recent years in state legislative races \u2014 flipping chambers in Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2014 after more than a decade of nationwide GOP dominance. But Republicans still control 55 percent of state legislative seats, compared to 44 percent for Democrats.\n\nYet Idaho Democrats are frank about their miniscule odds of sweeping the election in November \u2014 or anytime soon. Instead Democrats set a goal of knocking out the GOP\u2019s supermajority in the next decade. But even then, there\u2019s a long way to go: Democrats have just 18 seats across two chambers in the 105-seat legislature."},{"author":"Ok_Corner417","created_utc":1713358248,"title":"'I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fit for this job': GA senator gives USPS chief DeJoy an ultimatum","num_comments":94,"description":""},{"author":"rhino910","created_utc":1713358307,"title":"The accomplishment of every president since JFK","num_comments":126,"description":""},{"author":"John3262005","created_utc":1713358736,"title":"Impatience over stalled tax deal grows in Senate","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1713359591,"title":"Why Biden Should Not Debate Trump: Doing So Would Normalize Trump's Criminal Behavior","num_comments":95,"description":""},{"author":"HunchoDeRambo","created_utc":1713360630,"title":"How to respond to this?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1713361443,"title":"Secret Russian foreign policy document urges action to weaken the U.S.","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"Commercial-Archer-52","created_utc":1713363003,"title":"Had to share (ref: Former President Trump falls asleep again on 2nd Day after of trial.)","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Kunphen","created_utc":1713365532,"title":"Tell Congress: Stop the biggest expansion of government surveillance in decades","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1713367019,"title":"Right-Wing 'Reacher' Fans Flip Out After Alan Ritchson Calls Trump A 'Rapist And A Con-Man'","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1713367463,"title":"The A-Word: \u201cThese small-town lawmakers need to get with the program or their career is going to wind up in the trunk of a car.\u201d","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1713368676,"title":"Election handicapper moves Arizona Senate race to \u2018leans Democratic\u2019","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"D-R-AZ","created_utc":1713369598,"title":"NYT Is Said To Have Learned Nothing From Its Trump I Coverage","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"Informal-Suit9126","created_utc":1713370661,"title":"Former Congressman Madison Cawthorn Reportedly Crashes Into Florida State Trooper's Car -","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"jgravitt62","created_utc":1713370909,"title":"McCarthy's Revenge Tour: A Primary Race to the Far-Right Vs.

In 2021, Trump\u2019s political operation sent cease-and-desist letters to the RNC, National Republican Senatorial Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee demanding they stop using Trump\u2019s name, image and likeness in fundraising messages."},{"author":"Firefighter_Mick","created_utc":1713385945,"title":"\nMayorkas Impeachment Fails In the Senate\n\nThe Senate rejected both articles of impeachment today\n\nhttps:\/\/www.meidastouch.com\/news\/mayorkas-impeachment-fails-in-the-senate\n","num_comments":40,"description":""},{"author":"Horatiohornblowers","created_utc":1713386836,"title":"Stories from the Trump Bible","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Fine-Cat4496","created_utc":1713387502,"title":"Well, that was fun","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"AwayImagination7665","created_utc":1713388278,"title":"White evangelicals embrace raunchy photos \u2014 yet they hate sex as much as ever","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"AwayImagination7665","created_utc":1713388389,"title":"Evangelicals won't be bothered by Trump's abortion gambit \u2014 they know he's lying","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Squirrel_Inner","created_utc":1713388426,"title":"Arizona Rep who just helped maintain 1964 abortion ban, on contraception:","num_comments":27,"description":""},{"author":"AwayImagination7665","created_utc":1713388489,"title":"Trump rails against wind energy in fundraising pitch to oil executives as Republicans rush to help gut wind energy","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"chzygorditacrnch","created_utc":1713388644,"title":"We need Katie Porter to audit this country's spending","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"reynvann65","created_utc":1713388809,"title":"Found on r\/conservative","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"GreyBeardWizard","created_utc":1713388851,"title":"Trump campaign asks for cut of candidates\u2019 fundraising when they use his name and likeness ","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Free_Swimming","created_utc":1713389067,"title":"Prosecutions of Fake Electors for Trump Gain Ground in Swing States","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"QuailMaster7141","created_utc":1713389345,"title":"Secret Russian foreign policy document urges action to weaken the U.S. as the Republicans rush to help Russia","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"QuailMaster7141","created_utc":1713389399,"title":"Ex-official assures right-wingers: Trump just \"cloaking\" his actual \"extreme\" plans to get votes","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"QuailMaster7141","created_utc":1713389474,"title":"Republicans want a functioning House.

Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living \u2014 by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; \u201cmaking our democracy work\u201d with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and \u201cadvancing justice\u201d though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards."},{"author":"Ok_Corner417","created_utc":1713448302,"title":"Trump is funneling campaign money into cash-strapped businesses.

Austin Smith (R) \u2014 who was senior director at Turning Point Action, the campaign arm of Charlie Kirk\u2019s Turning Point USA \u2014 was accused by a Democratic activist of submitting petition sheets with rows of voter names, addresses and signatures that \u201cbear a striking resemblance\u201d to Smith\u2019s handwriting, according to a complaint. Smith \u201cpersonally circulated multiple petition sheets bearing what appear to be forged voter signatures,\u201d the complaint said.\nThe complaint was sent to the Arizona secretary of state, who forwarded it to the Arizona attorney general for review. State election officials do not assess the veracity of allegations made against candidates. A spokesperson for the state prosecutor\u2019s office, which runs a team that focuses on claims of voter and election fraud after widespread claims following the 2020 election, declined to comment. Both state offices are overseen by Democrats.\n\nSmith submitted his resignation to Turning Point Action on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.

Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) will give the White House cover to use stricter immigration executive actions by resurrecting a bipartisan border bill for a vote likely next week, Axios has learned.\n\nSchumer's move serves a dual purpose, also protecting his vulnerable Democratic incumbents on one of their worst issues ahead of 2024.\n\nRepublicans are expected to overwhelmingly vote against the bill, which would provide new tools to restrict access to asylum when border numbers surge.\n\nThe bill's failure would bolster the White House's standing to pull the trigger on similar, harsh restrictions using executive authorities \u2014 while blaming Senate Republicans for inaction.\n\nMultiple Democratic sources said they see Schumer's renewed focus on the border as a precursor to executive action by President Biden."},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1715945494,"title":"Verbal Melee Breaks out During Garland Contempt Hearing in

All I remember after that is that everything had a bald eagle and\/or an American flag on it, and I remember having to sing patriotic Lee Greenwood songs to the parents at functions. W\u2019s presidency had most of my childhood, and then I was in high school when Obama was elected. The Obama years were the years of me finding out who I was as a man, and his presidency actually in a way helped me navigate that. At 17 years old, I literally identified as a nationalist, god fearing, gun toting American when I graduated High School. Then, since I was not in the South Carolina education system anymore, was able to form my own opinions based on my experience, and the experiences of others. For once in my life, with politics, I listened. Came out better for it. I ended up liking Obama, and understood Democratic policies more towards the end, and then when Trump ran, I voted for Hillary in 2016, and then for Biden in 2020. Voted for Sanders in the primaries. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how 9\/11 triggered this crazy wave of nationalism. People fondly think back on that time as a time when all Americans were unified, and that there was togetherness and true brotherhood\/sisterhood. When I think back, I think about how they really tried to wire us to be the way that I was before I formed into a grown man. That\u2019s what W\u2019s presidency did to me and an uncountable number of kids, here in the South, and probably everywhere else too. \n\nWhat\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s experience with a presidency affecting you as a kid?

The number of unionized staffers is growing by the week as the campaign increases its payrolls ahead of November\u2019s election.\n\nIncluded in the contract are severance and a continuation of benefits after the November 5 election, increased time off for workers, monthly child care reimbursement, disciplinary protections, caps on hours worked, and health and safety protections.\n\nField organizers on Biden\u2019s previous campaign unionized in May 2020.

But\u2026..McConnell seated 3 SCOTUS seats changing the rules from a 2\/3 consent vote to 51. Dems need to heavily look into all avenues to level the process of removal for a SCOTUS judge to mirror the votes that they were seated with. So if a judge was seated with 51 votes, then they can be removed with 51 votes. If they were seated with 66, then it\u2019s 2\/3 to remove them. Article 3 doesn\u2019t spell out many details about Judicial removal it only says \u201cThe judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\u201d That\u2019s it. No explicit detail about impeachment being the sole mechanism of removal (Article 2 extends impeachment to \u201cCivil Officers\u201d but does not clarify what that encompasses. It\u2019s not a stretch to think if the founders wanted that to pertain to judges they would have added \u201cand Judges\u201d.) While SCOTUS would have ultimate review authority of a law passed against them, passing a law clarifying they need to be beholden to the same number of votes that put them on the bench would put a sharp light on this court historically as to how fair and impartial they truly are as well as spell out to the public their true allegiance. It would show the leg and exec branches pushing their check on judicial power more importantly and make SCOTUS think twice before ruling this law down because the next law passed could be expanding the court and stifling the conservative overreach.

During Biden\u2019s presidency, all democrats (47 dem senators) including 2 Independents (Sanders and King) support removing the filibuster in the Senate, so President Biden can pass legislation. The 2 newly-switched Independents (DINOs) Manchin and Sinema oppose removing the filibuster. \n\nLet\u2019s say that we remove the filibuster, enact everything we wanted (ex. abortion, universal healthcare) whats to say that a Republican majority wouldn\u2019t easily repeal that? Would a Filibuster removal actually be the true solution? Shouldn\u2019t we adjust \/ modify the filibuster to require less votes, or a talking filibuster ? (If you want to block legislation, talk for it. fight for it.) \n\nManchin and Sinema blocked for this very reason but it feels wrong to agree with them.

Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington and Cory Booker of New Jersey, includes four bills to preserve access to IVF and make it more affordable to get the procedure, which has helped millions of families have children. The four bills, which had been introduced previously, are the Access to Family Building Act, the Veteran Families Health Services Act, the Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act and the Family Building FEHB Fairness Act (FEHB stands for Federal Employees Health Benefit). \n\nThe legislation would establish a statutory right for patients to access IVF, protect providers from legal liability, ensure service members and veterans have access to the procedure and require more health insurers to cover fertility care.\n\nSens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, then introduced their own proposal that claims to safeguard IVF last month. The bill, titled the IVF Protection Act, wouldn\u2019t compel providers to offer IVF, but states would lose Medicaid funding if they outright banned access to the procedure.

U.S. officials are also hoping to recover the remains of three additional U.S. citizens who are believed to have been killed on that day by Hamas, which then took their bodies into Gaza. \n\nThe officials did not know what the United States might give Hamas in exchange for the release of American hostages. But, the officials said, Hamas could have an incentive to cut a unilateral deal with Washington because doing so would likely further strain relations between the U.S. and Israel and put additional domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

He was the judge who ruled in 2018 that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional and ruled in multiple cases that later became landmark Supreme Court decisions, including the 2015 Obergefell v.

Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama, introduced the legislation to protect access to IVF last month. But the bill, which would deny Medicaid funds to states that prohibit IVF, was quickly met with pushback by Democrats, who questioned its scope and mechanism. Still, on Wednesday, the senators sought to approve the bill unanimously, meaning a single senator could block its passage.\n\nThe bill, known as the IVF Protection Act, would require that states \"do not prohibit in vitro fertilization\" as a condition for the states to receive federal funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income Americans. It doesn't compel an organization or individual to provide IVF services, and it also doesn't preclude states from otherwise regulating IVF \u2014 which some Democrats take issue with. \n\nSenate Democrats have pushed their own bill to protect access to IVF, which they see as more comprehensive. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, has tried to approve her legislation to protect the fertility treatments with the same unanimous consent approach on multiple occasions, attempts that were blocked by one Republican."},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1718227947,"title":"House Republicans Vote to Hold Merrick Garland in Contempt of Congress","num_comments":47,"description":""},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1718228703,"title":"House Republicans Vote to Hold Merrick Garland in Contempt of Congress","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"ThinkerSis","created_utc":1718229344,"title":"Who Is Favored To Win The 2024 Presidential Election?","num_comments":58,"description":""},{"author":"BeatWorld","created_utc":1718229536,"title":"Hillary Clinton Commits D-Day Blunder \u2013 Online Backlash Ensues - Different Hub","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1718230495,"title":"Internet Reacts to RFK Jr\u2019s \u201cI Only Drink Raw Milk\u201d Declaration","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1718230635,"title":"Internet Reacts to RFK Jr\u2019s \u201cI Only Drink Raw Milk\u201d Declaration","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Disastrous-Rabbit108","created_utc":1718231876,"title":"Consumer Price Index: Grocery prices fall for fourth straight month","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1718232303,"title":"RFK Jr. Offered to Get Fake Vaccine Cards for His Kids for College","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1718233204,"title":"RFK Jr. Offered to Get Fake Vaccine Cards for His Kids for College","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"PacificSun2020","created_utc":1718233232,"title":"Goods inflation is finally fixed","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"frillociraptor","created_utc":1718233518,"title":"what will they take away next?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1718235385,"title":"Fulton County Prosecutors Move to Dismiss Appeal Seeking to Disqualify DA Fani Willis in Trump RICO Case","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"GreyBeardWizard","created_utc":1718235531,"title":"Poll shows Democrat Mucarsel-Powell surging against U.S. Senator Rick Scott","num_comments":50,"description":""},{"author":"PoliticalSenpai","created_utc":1718236282,"title":"Fulton County Prosecutors Move to Dismiss Appeal Seeking to Disqualify DA Fani Willis in Trump RICO Case","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"mlamping","created_utc":1718237817,"title":"Tech Employees lay offs","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Aggressive-Ice4949","created_utc":1718244529,"title":"Ticketmaster - shame on you","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"appmanga","created_utc":1718247651,"title":"Judges Are Out Of Control","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Plastic-Age5205","created_utc":1718248310,"title":"Let\u2019s Talk About Trump\u2019s Gibberish","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"Zestylamb69","created_utc":1718248745,"title":"Free Healthcare Has A Lot Of Benefits But What Do You All Think About The Downsides?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"AceCombat9519","created_utc":1718250896,"title":"Why the far-right surge in European elections could be an omen for Trump","num_comments":13,"description":""},{"author":"DJM_Shottgun","created_utc":1718262146,"title":"Join my server yall","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"keytwitchy","created_utc":1718266755,"title":"Medical debt cleared from credit report already?","num_comments":2,"description":"I couldn't find any articles of this taking effect yet, but I just noticed back in February my credit jumped up 150 points from Fair to Very Good and that my accounts previously containing medical debt are completely gone.

A big part of their modern identity revolves around targeting Democrats with what they've coined \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\". It's their innate feeling that Trump could cure cancer and world hunger and the left would still say he's the worst president ever and only did those things because they somehow line his pockets etc.\n\n\"Gun Derangement Syndrome\" hits them right back at the core and opens their eyes a lot more to their blind obsession with guns being good \"no matter what happens\". It takes the wind out of their sails a LOT on the which is the unhinged political side.  Especially with younger conservatives or even independents that see the hypocrisy of always being pro gun no matter how many innocents die and not allowing any nuisance in to a middle ground.\n\n\nThis is a political talking point that Democrats could win with a lot more from independents and young conservatives to vote their way that are really bothered about shootings and not NRA religious nuts.\n\nThe old school conservatives types won't budge no matter what you say but young conservatives and independents will be swayed by arguments that call out the old school conservative emotional obsession with limitless gun rights.\n\nYou could even hit back against \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" attacks with \"Gun Derangement Syndrome\" counter attacks.\n\nAnyways just an ex democrat's two cents on a subject that I'm very much still on democrats side on (along with some others).\n\nIf you can't tell, I am VERY upset about the supreme courts reversal of the Trump era Bump Stock ban."},{"author":"slurpeedrunkard","created_utc":1718402141,"title":"Daily Mail: JFK took the virginity of a 19-year-old White House intern in Jackie Kennedy's bed, before engaging in an 18-m","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"audiomuse1","created_utc":1718404080,"title":"Biden\u2019s small-business boom may undercut Trump\u2019s polling edge on economy","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Plastic-Age5205","created_utc":1718405267,"title":"\u201cWalks like a duck, swims like a duck\u201d: Sonia Sotomayor torches Supreme Court\u2019s bump stock ruling","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Far_Abbreviations125","created_utc":1718406015,"title":"Biden has the opportunity to do something really funny.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"h20poIo","created_utc":1718410702,"title":"Saw this and posted my comment, it was removed for content.
