Is there any kind of law against crossing party lines in a primary election in order to alter the outcome of a party\u2019s projected representative\/senator\/governor candidates and then voting for your respective party in the general election? I know of open and closed primaries but I guess is there an issue with a collective intent to change outcomes by simply voting?\n\nI feel like it\u2019s kind of cheating. But the crazies would stoop to that level without question and being the bigger person has proven ineffective thus far. I think that doing so could be an efficient method in thwarting undeniably seditious and totalitarian right wing fascists from gaining power. Vote against them in the Republican primaries to keep the most obedient Trumper from even being an option? I get that could alter the candidates of the Democratic party\u2019s general elections candidate but either way a more progressive democrat losing to a moderate conservative (if there even are any) would be better for democracy than a Trump minion. Would the mythical moderate just fall in line to pacify the base? Would the base change direction with more, again elusive, moderates in power?\n\nLots of hypotheticals, but I guess the main question is whether or not it\u2019s legal.  I see how it could be seen as deceitful and un-democratic, but given the current state of the union, \"Nobody pretends this act is constitutional, and nobody cares if it is or not.\""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1659311156,"title":"'Major criminal investigation': CNN reporter explains how prosecutors are inching closer to Trump","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Pubic_Ad2754","created_utc":1659311525,"title":"House Passes Bill That Would Protect Travel Out Of State For An Abortion\u2014Here\u2019s How","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"Souled_Out","created_utc":1659312304,"title":"Trump Sides with Russia Over Brittney Griner","num_comments":183,"description":""},{"author":"Pubic_Ad2754","created_utc":1659315337,"title":"House Passes Bill That Would Protect Travel Out Of State For An Abortion\u2014Here\u2019s How","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"molco-718","created_utc":1659319576,"title":"Religious speech and religious liberty - what can we do about it?","num_comments":12,"description":""},{"author":"Pubic_Ad2754","created_utc":1659319748,"title":"Trump's latest actions present urgent new questions for a GOP that has refused to constrain him","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"portiedak","created_utc":1659321617,"title":"Free Speech","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"fonerVersion","created_utc":1659323302,"title":"EU braces for China-US escalation risk as Taiwan tensions rise","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"ASMRwithBrian","created_utc":1659323930,"title":"Behind Tudor Dixon's rise in the messy GOP primary for governor in Michigan","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"Souled_Out","created_utc":1659326062,"title":"Trump's Lawyers Are Preparing Legal Defenses Against Criminal Charges","num_comments":28,"description":""},{"author":"tyrannosauru","created_utc":1659328980,"title":"Pelosi lands in Singapore to kick off Asia tour","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Pubic_Ad2754","created_utc":1659329955,"title":"GOP states push back against DC, NYC calls for federal help with migrant surge","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1659332362,"title":"Manchin to Sinema: Believe in this Bill","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1659351261,"title":"Andrew Tate Finally Gets Locked Up","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Kindly_Baby4695","created_utc":1659358767,"title":"As Manchin pushes for speedy passage of new deal, Sinema stays quiet","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"4TaxFairness","created_utc":1659362209,"title":"Manchin Spending Deal Includes Billions in Taxes on Oil Sector","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1659364732,"title":"can we all just agree to get along? 1 love, macdonalds burger","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"gotostep2","created_utc":1659364773,"title":"Next on the GOP\u2019s List: Starving Queer Kids","num_comments":27,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1659364917,"title":"Michigan counties that are Republican leaning have higher death-rates from Covid, Suicide and Opioid Overdoses AND they earned the lowest wages in the state.","num_comments":48,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1659366266,"title":"More missing J6 texts: now its DHS's Wolf & Cuccinelli.

He has placed his gestapo police in many school districts.\n\nHe only won the last Governor elections by 30k something votes. He acts like he is a moderate.

He is a conniving individual who will throw you under the bus like TFFG.\n\nSo if we want to make changes to the landscape in Florida. We need to get out and vote in November.

And the former president even claimed that he learned about some of this dirt through \u201cintelligence\u201d he had seen or been briefed on, these sources say.  \n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the Macron-related document the FBI seized during the raid had anything at all to do with the French president\u2019s personal life. Nor is it clear whether the information on Macron seized from Mar-a-Lago is derived from U.S. intelligence collection or even classified. \n\nBut the mere revelation of its existence triggered a trans-Atlantic freakout, according to two other sources familiar with the situation. And Trump\u2019s prior talk about Macron\u2019s allegedly \u201cnaughty\u201d ways that \u201c[not] very many people know\u201d only intensified those concerns. Both French and U.S. officials worked to figure out precisely what Trump had on Macron and France\u2019s government, and if any of it was sensitive in nature, the sources said. The officials in both nations wanted to know if this discovery signified some kind of national-security breach \u2014 or if it amounted to a frivolous, but stolen, keepsake.\n\nA spokesperson for the French embassy told Rolling Stone that their inquiry had not included asking the Biden administration for information on the documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago. \n\nIn his musing on Macron\u2019s alleged indiscretions, Trump was light on details and specifics, according to the sources. And as a notorious gossip peddler for decades, it\u2019s difficult to know if any of what he says is grounded in reality. \u201cIt is often,\u201d one of the sources says, \u201chard to tell if he\u2019s bullshitting or not.\u201d\n\nA Trump spokesperson did not respond to questions from Rolling Stone.\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Macron has often been volatile, with the U.S. president once labeling his French counterpart \u201cmy guy\u201d before the two fell out during Trump\u2019s time in the White House.\n\nTrump initially signaled his support for Macron\u2019s 2017 presidential rival, inviting far-right nationalist Marine LePan to Trump Tower and praising her in interviews. But Macron shrugged off the flirtation with his rival and invited Trump as the guest of honor to a Bastille Day parade in 2017. Trump was so taken with the elaborate military pageantry on display that it inspired him to ask for a military parade of his own. \n\nBy 2019, tensions between the two men and their worldviews burst into the open. After disputes between the two leaders over Iran, Syria, and NATO, Trump could be heard blasting Macron as a \u201cpain in the ass\u201d to a White House gathering of international ambassadors to the United Nations. Trump\u2019s former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham also wrote in a memoir that Trump had privately called Macron a \u201ca wuss guy\u201d and \u201ca hundred twenty pounds of fury.\u201d\n\nAnd the latest incident isn\u2019t the first time Trump has fixated on salacious gossip about the private lives of foreign leaders, associates, and hangers-on. \n\nAs Republican rivals J.D. Vance and Josh Mandel vied for his endorsement in the Ohio GOP Senate primary, Trump personally spread rumors he\u2019d heard about Mandel\u2019s sex life and described the candidate as \u201cfucking weird.\u201d And Trump\u2019s decision to endorse Vance was nudged along by a rumor Trump heard from Fox News star Tucker Carlson about a prominent Mandel supporter\u2019s allegedly \u201cchronic\u201d sexual habit. \n\nDuring the 2016 presidential contest, Trump briefly ducked into his campaign \u201cwar room\u201d and teased mid-level staffers with some alleged intel \u2014  on a pair of MSNBC hosts who weren\u2019t yet public about their romance. \u201cYou know, nobody else knows about it, but I know about Joe and Mika\u2019s little apartment in the Upper East Side,\u201d he gossiped, referencing Morning Joe hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, whose long-running relationship would soon become public. \u201cOne day, I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t even know these campaign staffers\u2019 names, but felt comfortable dishing this to them.\n\nTrump\u2019s fixations extended to foreign leader\u2019s families, as well. Grisham wrote in her memoir that, after seeing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on TV aboard Air Force One, Trump once pulled her aside and made a crass assertion about the sex life of the Canadian prime minister\u2019s mother \u2014 an assertion that left Grishham baffled.\n\nIn his conversations with his associates, Trump didn\u2019t offer an explanation of how American spies acquired the supposed Macron dirt he claims to have seen. But the U.S. intelligence community has become much more cautious about spying on close allies over the past decade. \n\nRevelations about American eavesdropping on former German Chancellor Angela Merkel prompted the Obama administration to severely restrict intelligence collection on allied heads of state. Under a 2014 directive known as PPD-28, the Obama administration forbade eavesdropping on the leadership of \u201cclose friends and allies\u201d absent \u201ca compelling national security purpose.\u201d After reviewing the order in 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would continue to abide by the Obama-era orders.\n\nNonetheless, intelligence about foreign allies can still be swept up in the intelligence community\u2019s broad collection of secrets through more incidental routes.\n\n\u201cWhile PPD-28 certainly constrained the degree to which the US would intentionally and directly collect on certain allied heads of state, there are plausible scenarios by which insights about them might be indirectly gleaned via collection against adversaries and their networks, human or technical,\u201d one former Trump White House official tells Rolling Stone."},{"author":"HausOfSun","created_utc":1661858997,"title":"Call the Trump Republicans as belonging to the Russia Party","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"gotostep2","created_utc":1661862778,"title":"Trump-backed Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters scrubs website of extreme anti-abortion stance as GOP frets over impact of Roe reversal on the midterms","num_comments":73,"description":""},{"author":"gh959489","created_utc":1661864448,"title":"(Damn I love this Woman...Hillary Rocks!!!) ---> Hillary Clinton shares dancing picture in support of Finnish Prime Minister","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"rhino910","created_utc":1661867033,"title":"House conservatives prep plans to impeach Biden","num_comments":198,"description":""},{"author":"gotostep2","created_utc":1661867691,"title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene tells Biden to \"go to hell\"","num_comments":58,"description":""},{"author":"Ill-Butterscotch5425","created_utc":1661872741,"title":"bingbong fokin african kids, donal trump 10\/10","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"realplayer16","created_utc":1661877815,"title":"Trump Demands Either New Election \u2018Immediately\u2019 or Make Him \u2018Rightful\u2019 President Now","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"realplayer16","created_utc":1661878046,"title":"Trump demands reinstatement as 'rightful' president or 'a new Election, immediately!' as some Republicans seek distance from him","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"realplayer16","created_utc":1661878581,"title":"Donald Trump Demands to Be Declared 'Rightful Winner' of 2020 Election Nearly 2 Years After Losing","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1661882280,"title":"7 more Republican leaders endorse Democrat Josh Shapiro for Pennsylvania governor, following news of GOP candidate Doug Mastriano wearing a Confederate military uniform","num_comments":66,"description":""},{"author":"NewYorkPainter","created_utc":1661883015,"title":"Prosecute Trump \u2014 it will lower the heated political temperature","num_comments":35,"description":""},{"author":"Free_Swimming","created_utc":1661885321,"title":"Ann Coulter Says Polls and More Prove Ex-President is Finished","num_comments":17,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1661885673,"title":"The wind has shifted: We can beat Republicans \u2014 and elect progressives \u2014 in November","num_comments":67,"description":""},{"author":"LolAtAllOfThis","created_utc":1661887227,"title":"'My bike is not bent': Herschel Walker answers 'mental fitness' question with rant about bicycles","num_comments":45,"description":""},{"author":"Upbeat_Motor_2234","created_utc":1661890397,"title":"Senate Republicans Refuse to Commit to Making Basic Rights, Including Interracial and Same-Sex Marriage, the Law","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"toosauccyy","created_utc":1661891004,"title":"Trump's Truth Social barred from Google Play store over content moderation concerns - CNBC","num_comments":9,"description":""},{"author":"CommanderKiddie148","created_utc":1661892325,"title":"Let's Face Facts.

The photo shows documents marked \u201csecret\u201d and \u201ctop secret\u201d and \u201cSCI\u201d \u2014which stands for highly classified \u201csensitive compartmented information.\u201d\n\nIn its late-night court filing, the Justice Department said that some of the documents seized were so sensitive and classified that FBI agents and DOJ attorneys needed additional security clearances to review them.\n\nThe filing came in response to former President Donald Trump\u2018s request Aug. 22 \u2014 two weeks after the Mar-a-Lago search \u2014 for a special master to review the documents seized from his Florida estate.\n\nJustice officials said that the appointment of a special master would impede the government\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nSuch a review of classified documents \u201cwould impede the Intelligence Community from conducting its ongoing review of the national security risk that improper storage of these highly sensitive materials may have caused and from identifying measures to rectify or mitigate any damage that improper storage caused,\u201d the DOJ document states.\n\nThe Justice Department said it could not trust information that came from Trump's orbit ahead of the Florida search and that a representative for the former president falsely asserted that classified documents had been turned over to the government. The fact that so many documents were found \"casts serious doubt\" on the Trump team's claim that there had been \"a diligent search\" for documents responsive to the grand jury subpoena in May.\n\n\"That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the 'diligent search' that the former President\u2019s counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter,\" the Justice Department said in the filing.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, signaled over the weekend that she was inclined to grant the former president's request and appoint a third party to review the documents to ensure they don't contain information protected by attorney-client privilege. The Justice Department has said that a government filter team that's separate from the investigation had already identified \"a limited set of materials\" potentially containing privileged information.\n\nIn Tuesday night\u2019s filing, the Justice Department argued a special master is unnecessary because government review teams have already finished their work. \u201cIt would do little or nothing to protect any legitimate interests that Plaintiff may have while impeding the government\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation,\u201d the DOJ filing says.\n\nAhead of Tuesday night's filing, the Justice Department had asked permission to file a response of up to 40 pages to Trump's special master request \u201cin order to adequately address the legal and factual issues raised\u201d by Trump\u2019s legal team.\n\nThe FBI search of Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8 came after extensive discussions with the National Archives and Justice Department officials over nearly 18 months.\n\nA redacted affidavit that laid out probable cause for the search revealed that the National Archives referred the matter to the FBI after it found \"a lot of classified records\" in 15 boxes that Trump turned over to the National Archives earlier this year. A subsequent FBI review of the boxes in May showed that 14 of the 15 boxes contained documents with classification markings. A total of 184 unique documents bearing classification markings were found, including 25 marked \"TOP SECRET.\"\n\nThe FBI was authorized to seize any documents with classified markings, along with the containers the classified documents were found in, along with any government or presidential records created during Trump's time in office and any \"evidence of knowing alteration, destruction, or concealment of any government and\/or Presidential Records, or any documents with classification markings.\"\n\nAmong the documents retrieved from Mar-a-Lago were Roger Stone's clemency paperwork, information about the president of France, and a trove of confidential and classified documents, along with presidential records. FBI agents seized 26 boxes, as well as a leather-bound box of documents containing Top Secret \/ Sensitive Compartmented Information, according to the property receipt of items recovered.\n\nIn a separate filing Tuesday, several former federal prosecutors who served during Republican administrations \u2014 Donald B. Ayer, Gregory A. Brower, John J. Farmer Jr., Stuart M. Gerson, Peter D. Keisler, William F. Weld, and former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman \u2014 wrote that \"regardless of one\u2019s political views, it is clear that there is no legal support for the relief requested by the former President.\""},{"author":"Souled_Out","created_utc":1661921575,"title":"Trump team likely sought to conceal classified docs at Mar-a-Lago, DOJ tells judge.","num_comments":29,"description":"The 36-page filing was the department\u2019s most detailed account yet of its evidence of obstruction of justice.\n\nEven if there were circumstances in which a former president could assert privilege, Bratt argues, this scenario would not come close. Intelligence officials are currently reviewing the recovered files to assess risks to national security, and any disruption to that could jeopardize the review, DOJ contends.\n\nThe Justice Department also noted that at a June 3 meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s aides treated the documents as though they remained classified, never contending that Trump had actually declassified them and producing some in \u201ca single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape.\u201d\n\nA Trump attorney then asserted in a certification letter to the government: \u201cA diligent search was conducted of the boxes that were moved from the White House to Florida\u201d and that \u201cany and all responsive documents accompany this certification.\u201d At the meeting, Trump\u2019s attorneys insisted that no subpoenaed documents were held in any other parts of the property but \u201cexplicitly prohibited government personnel from opening or looking inside any of the boxes that remained in the storage room.\u201d\n\nThe filing is the Justice Department\u2019s first response to Trump\u2019s legal bid to dampen the ongoing DOJ investigation into his retention of highly classified documents in an unsecured storeroom and elsewhere at Mar-a-Lago."},{"author":"coffeespeaking","created_utc":1661923501,"title":"DOJ: 'Efforts Were Likely Taken' To Obstruct Probe Of Trump's Classified Documents","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1661926443,"title":"PFOA & PFOS in Your Drinking Water & Bloodstream \u2014 The Bell","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Upbeat_Motor_2234","created_utc":1661927459,"title":"Rep.

The school district where my child goes to school is Round Rock ISD. For those who may not know, Round Rock is a suburb North of Austin and it spans both Williamson and Travis counties. Travis county is a blue county and Williamson county was historically red up until the last decade or so (now purple). Like a lot of school boards, the school board positions in our district are supposed to be non-partisan. Unfortunately, in 2020 we had two radical right-wing conservatives who were elected to our school board after running as much more moderate\/non-partisan. Since being elected, these two trustees have done a lot of damage to the district by creating havoc in board meetings and fueling lawsuits against the district from right-wing members of the community. They've taken board focus away from serving the students in the district and their supporters have made a mockery of our school board meetings.\n\nOur school board is made up of seven trustees and this year the five trustees who aren't radical conservative are up for election. The two radical conservative board members are actively supporting a slate of five candidates in an attempt to take over total control of the school board. They only need two seats to hold the majority, which would be a disaster for our wonderful school district. Of the five in the slate, one is an ex-Austin City Council member who [lost custody of his child due to child abuse](https:\/\/theaustinbulldog.org\/candidate-lost-custody-over-abuse-2\/). He has a history of being overtly racist and anti-LGTBQIA2S+. His [campaign signs](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/5b7w9p4vu4j91.jpg) read \"Teach ABCs + 123s Not CRTs & LGBTs.\" Another slate candidate [plead guilty to a 3rd-degree felony](https:\/\/twitter.com\/CognitaVagabond\/status\/1561673442344280069) after stealing $34,000 from her employer by depositing business checks into her personal account. Yet another slate member [has language on his website](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Nre9rQq) that is transphobic and he blatantly states that he's against teaching anti-racism. The other two are fully supportive of these three and there are other issues with them as well. Aside from the slate, there is another candidate running as a moderate alternative to one of the slate members, but [she is a q-anon follower](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Oy3QUaE) who was responsible for donating \"In God We Trust\" signs to take advantage of Texas' law requiring school districts to display such signs if they are donated.\n\n**Call to action:**\n\n1. Look into your local school board races and get to know the candidates, so that you're informed about who you're voting for in those races. I have personally been guilty of going to the polls and ignorantly voting for school board candidates, not knowing who they are or what they stand for. Never again!\n2. We're in a world of hurt if even two of these candidates get elected to our school board. We're fighting like hell to stop them, but they are well-funded. If you want to help us with our fight, please consider [donating to Access Education RRISD](https:\/\/secure.actblue.com\/donate\/accessrrisd). $1, $5, $100 - Anything helps!

My parents were able to save enough over 20 years to be able to fully pay for my education as well as my sibling's. They did have to make some sacrifices. They drove cars that were older than their kids. They bought a home and put off renovations they wanted (they still had some shag carpet and linoleum until a couple years ago). We only went on a couple vacations. We didn't go to the doctor unless it was absolutely necessary. They won't be able to retire when they hit 65 in a few years.\n\nAnd yes, I know that some people don't have any cars, some people don't have a home at all, and some people never went on any vacations. I am grateful that my family was better off. \n\nWhenever I see articles about the student loan forgiveness, I think about my parents who could really use $20,000 from putting two kids though college.
