( again too close to the end of his term not gonna happen) Is it the Georgia attorney general? ( he's Republican, not gonna happen) can he be charged after the inauguration by a new attorney general?  Or will we say \" we need to heal the countrys wounds so we will let it go.\" You know sometimes the only way to heal is to remove the infection completely even if it means amputation. It'll take some getting used to and it will hurt,  but it will heal. Otherwise in four years you will have someone worse (believe it or not it can be worse) out there doing the same thing.

Some part of me knew it was significant, but its significance to me was limited to the significance politics has to a middle schooler in general.\n\nWhile most of America moved on, with the worst financial crisis in modern history ongoing to deal with, there were a few people who were shaken to their core. The overwhelming popular support that Barack Obama drew, backed by his now famous promise of 'HOPE' akin to the hope and support from the masses FDR received in the '30s, well it scared Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell like nothing else ever had.\n\nAn African American, a Democrat, was on his way to becoming one of the most popular, most influential Presidents in history. He had defeated a Republican golden boy, a war hero, a well spoken and highly respected Senator, John McCain. The Republican party was about to be relegated to obscurity, or at least I'm sure that's how Mitch saw it.\n\nHe hatched his 10 year plan then, and that's the best way I can think of it. A scheme so un-American and so focused on a singular treacherous objective, to destroy Obama's Presidency and his legacy, and to cement together a Republican coalition the likes of which had never been seen before.\n\nI don't know if I want to get bogged down in the details, but if you're old enough, you'll remember the Republican shenanigans starting with the Republican victory in the midterms in 2010. They didn't even wait a year before they risked our country's reputation in the most reckless political move I'd ever seen. The debt ceiling crisis of 2011. I could not imagine Americans in government would destroy the century long reputation our government held with our AAA debt rating. It was almost traitorous. S&P specifically cited Republicans in congress as the reason for their downgrade. It wasn't until years later I found out they did it on purpose just so it would be seen as President Obama failing America. I promised myself I would never forget what they did, but I never could have expected how tame it would look compared to the atrocities committed by Republicans in the years to come. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nYou might remember at the start of the last decade, there was a movement known as the Tea Party Movement. They widely reported themselves to be a grassroots movement, but if you traced the money, and the real reason behind Citizens United, you would see that this fringe 'grassroots' movement was funded by the likes of the Billionaire Koch Brothers. On the same track as McConnell's scheme, their plan was to turn America against itself, and to create a new Republican party of their liking.\n\nThey used fear and propaganda, helped by shared agendas at Fox News, to essentially divide America and superglue the Republican party so that it would never fracture in the face of a challenger like Obama again. This took time, of course, and popular as ever Obama won another victory in 2012, lulling Democrats into a sense of security when it came to the Presidency. I remember reading stories on MSNBC declaring the Republican party dead or dying. They couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nFiscal Republicans and Social Republicans were slowly roped together through lies and hate. Fox News told conservative Americans that illegals were coming into America to defile and murder their family. They told them while this is happening, Democrats are trying to take away their guns so they can't defend themselves. They made them believe that their family and the American way of life was in danger, and this unintentionally radicalized many conservatives. It planted the seeds of doubt that the conspiracy theorists of Qanon latch on to today.\n\nAny attempt at informing them of the truth was met with hostility all the while Mitch was planning on executing the culmination of his almost ten year plan with the 2016 election.\n\nWhat he did is inexcusable. What he did to America just to meet a political end is inexcusable. Republicans in the previous century actually supported Abortion to an extent. Can you believe that? We are not divided by nature, we were intentionally divided to create a reliable Republican voter base that was brainwashed not to trust facts or the media.\n\nOf course what Mitch could never have known is that the monster he created was not his to control. Much like Frankenstein and his monster: enter Donald Trump, stage left.\n\nThis man soaked up the worst of the fringe conspiracies spawned by McConnell's propaganda campaign, and he amplified it. He wasn't taken seriously by anyone of course. A news organization reported on his campaign in their entertainment section. But all his primary challengers, who rightfully called him a moron before his election, they would suck his toes for pennies today. US Senators like Ted Cruz, showing sycophantic obsession to a man who launched middle school insults at him and his family.\n\nWhat the Republican party created was no longer conservative or Republican as we know it. In their fear they created a malignant tumor. I'm not calling Republicans a cancer here, please don't get this wrong. This is so much bigger than people. It's a darkness that has consumed the Republican party for the past four years. I personally see it as evil, but maybe that's hyperbole.\n\nNonetheless, it was a wrecking force no one could control, and after yesterday it's clear to see it has completely demolished the Republican party from within. This is the cautionary tale I think Democrats should be very much concerned with.\n\nI'm seeing democrats aching for Biden to abuse the government the way Trump has in order to get revenge. It may not seem evil at a glance, but ignoring norms the way Trump did, that's the same malignant darkness Trump brought, just with a different face. When Trump and McConnell divided the American electorate and pushed their supporters far right, it had the unintentional effect of sending their opponents to the far left.\n\nI'm already starting to see fringe conspiracy theories on the far left, and I'm afraid of them becoming mainstream. Theories like the centerists Democrats are Republicans in disguise and cancel culture being misused to attack people they disagree with. Make no mistake, this is the same malignant ideology that took over the Republican party. A party it brought down to its knees. We can not let that happen to the Democratic party. Which is why I hope that we will follow Joe Biden's lead to unite this country. To forgive instead of enact revenge. Mitch McConnell spent 10 years driving us apart. I hope we can spend the next four reconciling and coming together. \"A house divided against itself cannot stand\" said Abraham Lincoln over a century ago. If we don't, then we will collapse."},{"author":"Reaper02367","created_utc":1609937428,"title":"Stacey Abrams deserves the Presidential Medal of Freedom","num_comments":1,"description":"She deserves it for her work in Georgia this past election cycle.

I know Biden could issue an executive order banning the death penalty but I imagine there might be an uproar from the more conservative states like Alabama and Mississippi for example, possible supreme court challenges etc. They could also pass a bill in Congress, but how will say Joe Manchin and maybe other conservative\/red\/purple state democrats react to such a move?\n\nDo you think the death penalty will be gone by the end of Biden's term?

They have further colluded with the defendant during the impeachment trial. If the Democrats have to resort to the 14th amendment to bar Trump as is their duty then you have to ask why is this? The answer is it is for the sake of the country and their sworn duty. Therefore they must do what\u2019s necessary to save the country. \n\nEveryone needs to stop pretending this is anything but an attack on our Democracy. We must deal with our domestic enemies before they destroy the country.\n\nI am fine if the districts send new Republicans back to Congress but if you actively supported the 6th you have violated the 14th Amendment and can no longer hold elected office in this country.\n\nSection 1\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nSection 2\nRepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\nSection 3\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nSection 4\nThe validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\nSection 5\nThe Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."},{"author":"jtig5","created_utc":1613182613,"title":"Resurrection?","num_comments":1,"description":"\u2018I\u2019m not sure what happened here was incitement to resurrection.\u2019 - Ben Roethlisberger They really do think tRump is the second coming."},{"author":"Protector51","created_utc":1613183416,"title":"If you have discord and are interested in mock government servers!

As in debt they didn't rack up on purpose?  \n\n\nSo to make a long story short....my wife came here 8 years ago and became a citizen in late December 2020. But as with many immigrants, they seem to struggle with understanding how money, debt, credit cards...etc work here. My wife racked up almost 30k in debt while here. Not on shopping sprees or anything but from getting alot of credit cards and not really understanding credit cards are the easiest way to debt.   \n\n\nShe had an amazing credit score, but many of the cards have their 0% offers gone and now each card has crazy interest rates. To the point of we can't even afford rent or food at times now. Obviously there are options like bankruptcy or debt consolidation. But I was wondering if there are any plans to help immigrants who struggle with getting started here and get into debt?   \n\n\nFor those curious about my end of things (it tends to come up). I was on SSI but she makes to much now at Amazon so we depend on her checks.

We need to send way more money to schools, pay teachers more, and keep encouraging people go to college! This country is way more uneducated than it should be.

I'd like to express apologies if this is out of line for a first time poster, but I'd like a chance to vent a little and hopefully engage in discussion.\n\nWhile I'm not a US citizen, I do follow what goes on in America fairly closely, if for no other reason because it influences so strongly what goes on in my own country and others around the world. There's not a doubt in my mind that if I had the chance, and maybe one day I will, I would vote blue up and down the ticket. \n\nRecent years around the globe, and particularly in my native Poland, have shown very plainly how ruthless politics is, rules of engagement are based on cold calculation. Good or bad, it is what it is, not unlike chess, the point being ultimately to win over sympathy of the voter, which translates into electoral -- and then political -- power. You can't govern if you don't win. Like in chess, the winner is able to predict multiple outcomes derived from a a single move.\n\nHere's my question. What was the point of this impeachment? I understand and support the argument that it needed to be done, but strategy-wise, if the goal was to convict the thankfully former president in the Senate - did anybody at any point believe that was possible? 17 Republicans committing political harakiri? Correct me if I'm wrong, maybe somebody thought it *was* possible. But otherwise it's political malpractice, in my opinion. \n\nIt's been more than five years since these people have been on everybody's radar, isn't everyone sick and tired of seeing them gloat? Why give them another opportunity to do it? I'd like to see the former president suffer *a* consequence. The election is one thing, but now he can claim being vindicated. My point is that the acquittal is strategically a setback from whichever angle you look at it, seven GOP senators crossing over being just a bitter consolation prize.\n\nThanks for reading this vent, those who did, I'm Jed and I'm eager and enthusiastic to speculate wildly about the future."},{"author":"thesuburbiareport","created_utc":1613348221,"title":"Warding Off A Potential Trump Victory In 2024 Should Be Easy \u2013 In Theory","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Bakadare99","created_utc":1613348798,"title":"For Trump, an Escape, Not an Exoneration","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"NakeyTimeNow","created_utc":1613349238,"title":"WELP \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","num_comments":160,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613351341,"title":"What's the end goal?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613351639,"title":"Dear Parasites:","num_comments":4,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613351936,"title":"Everyone hates biden in my community","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"1000000students","created_utc":1613354673,"title":"This Republican Prosecutor Stood Up For BLM Protests.

I've been reading more about President Biden's health care public option and I'm concerned it will eventually put me out of a job, a job that I need to support my family. There's also 2 million + other jobs and families supported by the health insurance industry.\n\nIs there anyone else concerned about losing their job due to the public health care option? Will Democrats have enough support to pass such a bill even with control of all three branches of government? I assume the push for such a bill will come over the next two years.\n\nI remember Senator Bernie Sanders Medicare for all option would have granted 3-5 years pay to displaced health insurance workers but with the public option I fear there won't be anything similar offered.\n\nThank you"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613526947,"title":"OC from a couple days ago that I forgot to post.","num_comments":52,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"backpackwayne","created_utc":1613527228,"title":"Live Discussion Thread - Joe Biden Town Hall Meeting in Milwaukee","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"randomguyhere1941","created_utc":1613527269,"title":"Biden's fireside chat question","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"pattyrick123","created_utc":1613527653,"title":"What is our version of the Republican Revolution in 1994?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613527944,"title":"Secret Combos \u2013 Exposing secret combinations of the CCP, Big Tech, and other threats to democracy","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"drwho_who","created_utc":1613528176,"title":"Texas Blackouts Make California\u2019s Outages Seem Like a Hiccup","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613528902,"title":"Trump blasts McConnell as a 'hack' who lacks 'political insight'","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"PoochieGlass1371","created_utc":1613529129,"title":"\"WILL PASS $2000 STIMULUS CHECKS IF ELECTED\"","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613529418,"title":"OH NO!!! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"bernd1968","created_utc":1613531175,"title":"Trump Lovers Charged In Capitol Attack Didn't Like Antifa Getting Credit For Their Work","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Goast3r","created_utc":1613533004,"title":"Ha","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Drshoes11","created_utc":1613533976,"title":"If we get the 15 dollar minimum wage how long do you think it would take to go into affect?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"AspieNH1234","created_utc":1613534907,"title":"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/americas\/exas-mayor-power-outage-facebook-b1803181.html.","num_comments":5,"description":"He\u2019s a Republican, in Texas, telling people that they need to suck it up after the state and local government seemingly greatly mismanaged the power grid and ability to respond to emergencies.

My boyfriend just went home to check it out, and the power is still out, and now the water is out, and it\u2019s 42 degrees inside.\n\nI feel like laughing and crying and beating my head on a wall every time I see someone blame the whopping 20% of Texas\u2019s energy sources while also literally using the words \u201crenewable energy.\u201d I replied to somebody last night with a Forbes link that explains how wind turbines are not the problem, and somebody else replied with a YouTube video of Glenn Beck ranting about it. There\u2019s no real conversation to be had when one side presents an article from a neutrally reliable news source with detailed information and the other side counters with a video rant of a far-right biased millionaire who is a media CEO and political commentator with no college education. \n\nI just needed to vent to understanding people. I vote straight-ticket in every election I can. I am a recent cancer survivor with a good job and family here, so moving is not so simple. But I am so fed up with politicians like Abbott, Cruz, and Cornyn who continually flat out lie to the public, and republicans eat it up and believe them even when faced with overwhelming counter facts. It feels like they will never face any consequences for lying and destroying lives."},{"author":"Privacy_74","created_utc":1613581564,"title":"Sean Hannity Busted For Lying About \u201cSpontaneous\u201d Presidents Day Crowd For Trump In Florida","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"jag316","created_utc":1613583042,"title":"Rush Limbaugh, the incendiary radio talk-show host,\u2032 dies at age 70","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613583361,"title":"Rush Limbaugh, conservative media icon, dead at 70 following battle with cancer","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"flaskman","created_utc":1613583460,"title":"Rush Limbaugh Dead at 70","num_comments":12,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613583784,"title":"'I will not make that happen': Biden declines Democrats' call to cancel $50K in student debt","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613583891,"title":"Rush Limbaugh dead at 70","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"RazielJD","created_utc":1613584017,"title":"Rush Limbaugh, US conservative icon, dies aged 70","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Schickie","created_utc":1613584108,"title":"Rush Limbaugh, bombastic talk radio host and voice of American conservatism, has died.

That is his legacy, a life of hate that perpetuated dangerous and hateful stereotypes. I never understood the need for people to embrace someone's death with falsehoods, just to disguise their life as worthwhile. He was an angry, hateful man, and now that he's dead, the world is better off without him. Good riddance. \n\nThere's no place in this world for hate and intolerance. And no, I'm not hateful because I'm stating facts. The man was a living, breathing testament to all things evil and wrong in our world, and now he's no longer breathing. Seems appropriate. \n\nI'm not glad he's dead, but there's no disputing the man was a monster. I understand that death can be scary to some, so we feel this need to create a legacy for someone that depicts their life as worthwhile. I've been at death's door, inside death's house even, and I don't feel that need. I'm no longer scared of it, and I refuse to contribute to a legacy that someone didn't earn. \n\nHe was an evil monster, and now he's dead.

Greg Abbott\u2019s hand-picked utility regulators decided they no longer wanted to work with a nonprofit organization they had hired to monitor and help Texas enforce the state\u2019s electric reliability standards.\nThe multiyear contract between the Public Utility Commission and the obscure monitoring organization, the Texas Reliability Entity, was trashed. Over the next months, right up until the crippling storm that plunged millions of Texans into the dark and cold, the state agency overseeing the power industry operated without an independent monitor to make sure energy companies followed state protocols, which include weatherization guidelines. The Public Utility Commission\u2019s decision in November to end its contract with the Texas Reliability Entity didn\u2019t cause the historic grid failures that this week transformed Texas into an undeveloped country, leaving large swaths of the state without power or water as temperatures dropped and stayed below freezing. A PUC spokesman said the agency still had ample protections to ensure energy companies followed state rules and guidelines.\nOn Thursday, Abbott called for a state law requiring power plants to be better weatherized. Yet over the past quarter-century, state leaders have refused to require the companies to prepare for severe weather, even as once-in-a-lifetime storms have arrived with increasing frequency.\nCritics say the utility commission\u2019s move to strip away a regulatory layer, especially with potentially severe weather approaching, was just the latest example of the consistently light touch Texas politicians have used to oversee the complex industry that generates and distributes power. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to me that the PUC would get rid of the independent reliability entity with no plan to replace it,\u201d said state Rep. Rafael Anch\u00eda, D-Dallas, who sits on the Texas House Energy Resources Committee. \u201cNo staff, no oversight on reliability.\u201d"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1613921445,"title":"Here ya go!!!!","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"TRMact9","created_utc":1613921823,"title":"John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940. \"Walk with the wins brothers and sisters...\"","num_comments":18,"description":""},{"author":"Alexypine","created_utc":1613924202,"title":"What happened?

Obviously I think all of these are absurd, but that seems to be the logic. There's also the classic bootstraps argument, ie \"I worked hard (and probably benefited from certain privileges), so you should just make better choices to get more money\".

The bill would restrict dropbox access, add new ID requirements for mail voting, and restrict weekend voting among other provisions, all of which demonstrate just how unrelenting the GOP-led Georgia legislature is in their attacks on voting rights.\n\nNot only are these ID and witness restrictions suppressive and unnecessary, but they are also outwardly discriminatory, and would have a disparate impact on Black and other minority voters across our state, as well as older voters and voters in single-person households. These proposals would erect a juggernaut of barricades to voting access, reviving Georgia\u2019s dark history of voter suppression and racism as state policy.\n\n**\u201cOnce again, GOP legislators in Georgia today showed the clear and urgent need for federal action to safeguard voting rights and pass HR 1 and HR 4 to protect voters from racist and malicious voter suppression,\u201d** said Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo. **\u201cSB 241 and HB 531 are two of the most restrictive absentee voting policies in the country. These bills are nothing less than a direct attack on voting rights in GA, framed by far-right conspiracies and disinformation that undermines our democracy and takes voting rights in Georgia back to the days of Jim Crow.\u201d**\n\nSB 241 and HB 531 are assaults on democracy that constitute some of the worst attacks on voting rights since Reconstruction. Their progress today again shows just how critical it is that Congress pass HR 1 and HR 4 to protect voters and safeguard our democracy.\n\n\\###"},{"author":"DoremusJessup","created_utc":1614209941,"title":"Forensic Audit of Dominion Voting Machines in Arizona Shows \u2018No Evidence of Vote Switching\u2019","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Taztiger72","created_utc":1614211827,"title":"Look I've Done Near Had Enough Of This!

Civil rights activists knew that and that is why they exercised that political power such as in the case of the Montgomery bus boycott and the Greensboro sit-ins which led to boycotts at multiple segregated lunch counters. \u201cCancel culture\u201d is a term specifically used more often than not to describe the Left using its economic power to protect people\u2019s civil liberties and effect positive change. What MLK and other civil rights leaders did would today be called cancel culture.  \n\nEffecting political change is messy. Sometimes there is collateral damage that could have been avoided. Sometimes people make bad calls or act on bad information. Sometimes there are unintended consequence. But this is not an argument in favor of tying activist hands and limiting our options.  \n\n\nVoting and political discourse is not the only \u201clegitimate\u201d way to exercise political power. Voting has negative consequences too. Half a million fellow Americans died because of the voting decisions of less then 50% of the electorate. I think it is safe to say cancel culture isn\u2019t going to get more people killed then that. Should we stop voting too? Has voting culture gotten out of hand?

Rick Scott and Marco Rubio love to have it both ways. as it is now, 49 Republican Senators can bitch and moan about how terrible this is for our country and is being forced on them over their objection, but their constituents still benefit from it. and let's face it, those checks coming to Florida and Alabama and Tennessee and South Carolina are definitely getting cashed the same way they are in New York, California, and Michigan."},{"author":"Lamont-Cranston","created_utc":1615057146,"title":"Grace and style","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"campindan","created_utc":1615057750,"title":"People are misunderstanding why some Democrats voted against the minimum wage amendment","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"theprowler02","created_utc":1615058125,"title":"The right can\u2019t get anything right these days","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1615058422,"title":"Stop watching this and spread the word","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"AbdulMusa","created_utc":1615059608,"title":"MSNBC\u2019s Malcolm Nance Warns of a Violent \u2018Paramilitary\u2019 Trump Insurgency","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1615059952,"title":"Former Trump supporters.

How likely is it that they can somehow use budget reconciliation again this year to pass progressive legislation like the Green New Deal (or similar infrastructure legislation), Medicare for All, and the $15 minimum wage?

Violators shouldn't be sent to jail but instead pay a fine proportionate   to their income measured by the day. Such fines would go directly to  initiatives in the fight against the virus, such as health care and   others.  Therefore, people who don't want to wear masks would be paying  their daily fine and balance out the risk they pose to others and  preserve their freedom.\n\nIn  addition, restaurants and places of entertainment shouldn't have  restrictions on capacity due to the virus. In said places, people choose  to risk it, they don't need to go there. So if someone wants to risk  their health by eating in a restaurant, I believe that's their right.  Workers in said locations should be provided reasonable protections to  hold to their job if they don't want to lose it if they don't want to  show up due to the risks. For example, the employer could hire someone  else temporarily while the pandemic is still going on and the worker can  stay home with a government assistance of a portion of the worker's  regular income (i.e. a third). Or the worker could agree to resign if  the employer provides the employee with an indemnization the worker  accepts, without being forced to accept nor pressured."},{"author":"MBlaizze","created_utc":1615401764,"title":"Trump requests mail-in ballot ahead of local Florida election despite baseless fraud claims","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1615402254,"title":"82 million \ud83d\ude09","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1615402383,"title":"Where the hell am I?","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1615403348,"title":"Since the Republican Party doesn\u2019t want the checks.

Equality is women being able to work and make the same amount to the very damn penny. Do not give me the whole \"its not a perfect world\" bs, not a single soul on earth need be perfect to give equality to the next person, you can not place equality in the realm of perfection for no human can be perfect, we must understand that equality can live outside of all of that and it can and must exist for humanity to continue. \n\nTo live a life of equality I have to understand I am no better than the next no matter their life choices as you are human as I.

They used to be a great organization that truly cared about human life and the impact guns have in our society. \n\nWhat's the difference between the old NRA and the one we have today? The members. \n\nToday's NRA membership is predominantly right-leaning Republicans and they control both the agenda and how the organization distributes its funds. But the NRA only has 5M members and most estimates are that barely half those members are active. To take control of the organization wouldn't take as many people as you think. \n\nThe NRA won't stop what they are doing on their own and their efforts are clearly effective. The only way to stop them for good is to reclaim the good that they used to do. \n\nAnd while we're on the subject, why is the word 'patriot' and the use of the American flag euphemisms  for Republican these days? Let's reclaim those terms and start using them in the left-wing rhetoric as well. Words have power and let's remove the power from those words."},{"author":"AliensAreComing4Tea","created_utc":1616547916,"title":"Running into conspiracy theorist claiming the Boulder shooting was fabricated","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"kphill262","created_utc":1616550240,"title":"Help with a question.","num_comments":40,"description":"\nI asked my State Senator who is also the speaker for the Wisconsin Senate why you need a license to be a lawyer or banker when the government just bails you out when you screw up?\n\nHe has not responded.\n\nI posted this question in \/r government and it was removed for not being civil.

Why don't the democrats craft the $15 minimum wage bill so it relates to spending and revenue? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is how I think it can be done and will be a win-win solution\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncrease the minimum wage to $15, but subsidize (spending) the employers who pay less than the $15 by increasing the taxes on the top earners (revenue). If an employer pays $7.25\/hr and hires 10 people subsidize that employer by paying them $77.5\/hr (15-7.25)\\*10. This money gets paid out to the employees thus increasing the minimum wage to $15. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn year 1 the employer bears 0% of the cost of increasing the minimum wage and the government pays 100%. The % paid by the government could be phased out to 0% over the span of 5 to 10 years. The rate at which the subsidies are phased out can be calculated based on how well the local economy is going to prosper due to this increased minimum wage. A strong local economy will increase the employer's revenue and profits and will counterbalance the load the employer will take as they slowly but surely contribute a higher and higher percentage of the $15\/hr  \n\n\nOther than being able to bypass the filibuster there are a number of other benefits to this approach\n\n1. Employers in rural areas are not forced to layoff people to maintain their operating costs\n2. Small Businesses are not forced to increase the prices of goods and services to account for the increased operating costs (as the operating costs will not increase)\n3. Most Republican voters will like this idea \n   1. as their taxes will not increase\n   2. Their paychecks will be bigger\n   3. More poor people having more money will boost the local economy\n   4. Small business is not going to be negatively impacted\n4. Democrat politicians & voters are going to love this as it combines multiple items on their agenda\n   1. Tax the rich for wealth re-distribution\n   2. Increase the minimum wage\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't done any back of the envelope math to calculate how much the taxes should increase, but if the Democrats who proposed the $15 minimum wage bill think small business can handle the increased operating costs, I am 100% certain that a small increase in taxes for the top earners will be enough to subsidize the small business owners\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my mind, this sounds like a bullet-proof no-brainer win-win method to increase the minimum wage. Why hasn't anyone proposed it?"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1616721824,"title":"Revolution Statement that's going around Facebook","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Thisbetterbefood","created_utc":1616721984,"title":"Are there any senators against reforming the Filibuster?","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Hour_Page2625","created_utc":1616723000,"title":"Terrifying thought, what if the GOP pulls a Uno reversal by supporting everything except the Voting Right DC Statehood and For the People Act?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1616723814,"title":"Question","num_comments":3,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"CaliburnZ","created_utc":1616724049,"title":"Politicians get trolled in zoom call","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Andalib_Odulate","created_utc":1616725306,"title":"A poem for Senator: My Daughter price gouged life saving medication","num_comments":1,"description":"Get a spine.\n\nGet in line.\n\nYou're wasting time.\n\nOn the peoples dime.\n\nQuit acting nine.\n\nIt's fucking time!"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1616726225,"title":"Boycott Georgia.

Please feel free to redirect me if this isn't the place to post.\n\nSo here goes. I'm a guy in my early 20s who lives in a very red \"Rust Belt\" state in the Midwest. And I would say I've had a very typical childhood experience for someone from here, including political and religious background: I was raised in a pretty socially and religious conservative household. While I have some memories about government from early childhood (like vaguely Bush as President), politics became a much bigger focus of my life with the 2008 election. The actions, cultural issues, and policies of the Obama administration were the center of frequent conversation in my house. They were \"bad\" and \"ruining America\" (in my family's opinion), and being a kid, I mostly accepted this framework and worldview up until my teenage years.\n\nAs a young teenager, I began to express disagreement with some of my parents' religious and political views (especially on social issues, which led to shouting more than once). It resulted in frequent arguments, and after a few years of this (in addition to continued exposure to almost exclusively conservative political commentary), I eventually stopped talking about my views. Over the next couple of years (mid to late teens), I feel like I tried to form to \"fit the mold\" of some of my family's political beliefs again. I mostly took in conservative commentary and media through big YouTube boom of more culturally ascendant conservative commentators on the right, which really took off just before the 2016 election.\n\nTo make a long story hopefully less long, I voted for Trump (and Republicans down ballot) in 2016 (my first election where I could vote) and 2020. But there were considerations that bothered me privately. Everything from personal conduct, mannerisms, some policies, to the \"fly by the seat of your pants\" attitude of the former administration. And the actions and rhetoric of Republicans at large recently has bothered me too: the hand waving away of investigation relating to the Capitol on January 6th, the unwillingness to be compromising, the attempt to lower trust in America's voting process, the obsession with culture war issues, and even the recent attempts to whittle away at voter's rights. It's frankly frightening.\n\nAnd recently I feel like I've been lying to myself about my worldview and stances on political issues for a long time. So I've been making an attempt to be more honest with myself and others about my opinions when conversations happen. And I feel embarrassed that I've allowed myself to vote for certain people. But I want to be more educated and go into every election without so much partisan bias without considering what's really for the best of our country. In a lot of ways, I can't consider myself a Republican.\n\nI'm not even entirely sure what I'm asking. I guess do you think I might be a Democrat? Or has anyone here been or is in my position? Or how can I properly educate myself more to figure this out?\n\n\n**TL;DR: Grew up in a \"Republican\" environment, believed and voted that way since 2016. I don't align with Republicans in a lot of ways if I'm honest with myself, am I really a Democrat?**"},{"author":"NORDLAN","created_utc":1616811169,"title":"A Private Jet of Rich Trumpers Wanted to \u201cStop the Steal\u201d\u2014But They Don\u2019t Want You to Read This","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"letstalkaboutit24","created_utc":1616812430,"title":"The corrupt GQP","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"aschleighonlyfans","created_utc":1616812969,"title":"More money than working","num_comments":2,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"DoremusJessup","created_utc":1616813170,"title":"Michigan G.O.P.

That doesn't even have any rational connection to the pretextual excuse of safeguarding against fraudulent votes. So I wonder if that part of the law could even pass rational basis review, let alone any scrutiny higher than that.\n\nBut then there are the other parts of the law, the parts that at least purport on their face to be aimed at detecting and stopping election fraud. While that may be the pretextual excuse, anyone with half a brain can tell that this is just being passed by a Republican-trifecta state in order to keep the democrats out of power. It's clearly just designed to make it logistically impossible for black citizens to vote in large enough numbers that the democrats can pose a threat.\n\nNow, do we have any *proof* (that is to say ... evidence that will hold up in court, not just our common sense as we read the news) that the Georgia Republicans are purposefully and maliciously targeting black voters (as opposed to Democrat voters)? Probably not. However, is it really necessary for us to show said proof? I would argue that, if an election law even so much as has the *disparate impact* of discriminating against black citizens, that alone means it violates the 15th Amendment to the US Constitution.\n\nThat's how it works with employment discrimination. For example, in many federal appellate circuits, it is illegal to discriminate against an applicant for employment solely on the basis of their criminal record, because courts have recognized that such a policy has the disparate impact of disproportionately affecting black people, even though the words \"disparate impact\" never appear in the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. If the words \"disparate impact\" don't appear in the Civil Rights Act but it's still the force of law nonetheless, I see no reason why the same logic can't also be used to incorporate a \"disparate impact\" provision into the 15th Amendment.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Will this law likely be struck down as unconstitutional?"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1616855051,"title":"A Minnesota man can\u2019t be charged with rape, because the woman chose to drink beforehand, court rules \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2c","num_comments":20,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"werdmouf","created_utc":1616855086,"title":"Georgia Jim Crow bill signed in front of painting of slave plantation","num_comments":11,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1616855529,"title":"Christopher","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"skobombs","created_utc":1616855946,"title":"Boycott Coke - GA voting Laws","num_comments":7,"description":"Please pass on the word on that your house is boycotting coke products until they come out against the new GA voting laws.\n\nGive em hell Reddit \n\npress@coca-cola.com"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1616858202,"title":"Jason, Aissa, and Ricky!","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1616861886,"title":"North Korea says Biden administration took wrong first step over latest missile test","num_comments":9,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Thisbetterbefood","created_utc":1616862532,"title":"Are there any restrictions on what items voting rights bills can include?","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"epc2ky","created_utc":1616864682,"title":"Detailed list of top 100 companies in Georgia.

Let\u2019s jump right into why I think the filibuster\u2019s (potential) removal can be a very damaging thing.\n\nScenario 1, good ending \n\nDemocrats use reconciliation to pass HR1 or similar methods. This creates the ideal voting scenario and the Democrats break the tradition of the sitting presidents party losing votes and Dems gain more seats in both house and senate and become a filibuster proof majority. Democrats remove the filibuster and are able to pass laws freely and serve the American people without GOP curb stomping any bill like they are today.\n\nScenario 1.1, alternative good ending \n\nDemocrats use some weird political trickery (Joe Manchin support?) to bypass the filibuster essentially and pass the much needed filibuster-required bills we have. The rest of the scenario plays out like the original.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nScenario 2, the \u201cdouble edged\u201d bad ending \n\nThis scenario plays out almost identical to scenario 1 and can be used in scenario 1.1. The bad ending comes up in 2024 where in this scenario a red wave comes and takes the House, barely takes Senate, and Presidency.

If you think about it there was some serious thought that went into it too, as they first had to have the Supreme Court overturn the Voting Rights Act.  Then zoom out and focus back in on young people.  This demographic has grown up with nothing but mass shootings, and school shooter drills.  The one time the kids rise up and demand common sense gun laws and the Republican held government loses their spine and refuses to do anything.  Add to that the incessant pandering to a white religious minority.  Now a few years ago, I was under the impression that someone would realize these things and they would logically start making a shift towards the middle to compensate, instead they decided to go the other way and burn bridges on their way down.

But they couldn't have possibly predicted social media and the rate at which disinformation, much of it foreign influenced, will spread.\n\nHamilton -The Federalist No 68- \"The desire \\[of\\] foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our counsels\" was a source of corruption and \"one of the most deadly adversaries of republican government.\"\n\nAdams shared that concern, discussing such he wrote to Jefferson \"As often as Elections happen the danger of foreign Influence recurs.\"\n\n\"Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ... the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.\" - Washington's farewell address.\n\nIn late 2019 Val Broeksmit acquired emails belonging to his father, former Deutsche Bank executive William S. Broeksmit who, like another Trump insider -Epstein, took his own life in 2014. Val presented these to the FBI. Shortly later in 2020 we out vis-\u00e0-vis Trump's recently released tax returns that he owes $400 million dollars to an undisclosed source. BUT now we know where he owes it.\n\nTrump immediately, and unsuccessfully, tried to sue and silence Broeksmit who testified that the Russian State Bank was underwriting loans, PERSONAL and business, for Trump when Deutsche no longer would due to his previous defaulting on $640 million. Val presented many documents and it appears the Russian state bank had been signing off on Trump's personal loans for years. Putin signs off on loans from the Russian state bank.\n\nMadison - \"Newfangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other.\u201d For that reason, Madison continued, \u201cthe convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime.\u201d\n\nDefinition: In Article III, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, treason is specifically limited to levying war against the US, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.\\[2\\]\n\nPenalty: U.S. Code Title 18: Death,\\[8\\] or not less than 5 years' imprisonment (minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death). Any person convicted of treason against the United States will lose the right to hold public office in the United States. \\[9\\]\n\nThe terms used in the definition derive from English legal tradition, specifically the Treason Act 1351. Levying war means --- the assembly of armed people to overthrow of the government or to resist its laws. --- Enemies are subjects of a foreign government that is in open hostility with the United States.\\[10\\] ----- Those who assemble to levy war, as well as those who conspire with them, can be prosecuted. ----- \\[11\\] The American definition is narrower than that of English law, which spanned other classes of treason such as counterfeiting and bringing indignity upon the king.\\[12\\]\n\nNote from above -- Levying war means the assembly of armed people to overthrow of the government or to resist its laws. Those who assemble to levy war, as well as those who conspire with them can be prosecuted.\n\nI personally think that owing hundreds of millions to an enemy nation, one that is openly hostile to the U.S, and has been sending unprecedented numbers bombers over the skies and off the shores of Alaska, makes him a little adherent. If you owed $400 million to a bank that you signed and Putin signed, would you say that's a little sticky?\n\nAug 18, 2017 Bannon leaves the white house. Oct 28, 2017 he started Qanon. So there really was an insider leaking for a bit, but as a propagandist the seeds he sowed were corrupted. Ron and Jim Watkins took over and just continued to spread lies and by the time the election rolls around in 2020 there's enough members to be a literal FACTION of the US. The group has become volatile and militant, they have been taught by Q that the democrats are evil enemies of the country, and Trump being full in on the thought heist repeats those claims. Trump, by claiming he doesn't know of Q, gives it legitimacy, Q must be telling the truth if he is saying the same things that Trump, the patriot, is saying. By that same association Q lends credibility to Trump because if you trust Q and Trump repeats his \"truths\", then Trump must be a good guy.\n\nMadison, Federalist 10 - \"Among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.\"  \n\\- \"By a faction I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\"\n\nThe Qanon Faction and right wing militant members\/associates want a civil war based on misinformation that was pushed by a Russian asset and foreign ascendant. If Trump had really got the 1million in this first coup, as he requested, then we would no longer be a democratic constitutional republic. Trump will march again, and he's not doing it to MAGA.\n\nQanon and the MAGA faction have a couple traitorous generals, Michael Flynn and his brother, on their side as well. This is noteworthy because they retain some level of loyalty. His brother, the other Flynn, is the one responsible for delays in sending theNational Guard to help in Washington duiring the riot. Holding back troops, and giving the insurrectionists as much time as possible. He advised that having any guard assist would \"be bad optics.\"\n\n\u201cIn all very numerous assemblies, of whatever characters composed, passion never fails to wrest the sceptre from reason,\u201d - The federalist #55.\n\nTrump ambiguously gestures Qanon all the time. He wears a Q jersey, Q is the 17th letter. He does Q hand signals, he says Q instead of you, etc. The whole time lying and saying he doesn't know what the movement is. It was all part of a ploy to turn true patriots' love of country into a malignancy, and it worked.\n\nPatriot is a pretty common word, but it's a code-word within Q that's used to address one another. So when Trump announced the march on DC, claiming that it was going to be the biggest most wild march ever, and then said he was calling all PATRIOTS, Trump knew he was calling out to those loyal to him within the violent faction that was waiting. After all they were told to \"sit back and stand by.\""},{"author":"bernd1968","created_utc":1617497580,"title":"The Trump campaign reportedly cheated donors who thought they were making a one-time contribution, collecting recurring donations","num_comments":25,"description":""},{"author":"NORDLAN","created_utc":1617498407,"title":"Georgia Gov.

I have given fentanyl in high doses, multiple doses, for over 10 years.\n\nFentanyl is not an anesthetic (corrected: *primarily an anesthetic). It\u2019s a narcotic pain medication. It can suppress your respiratory drive. Usually we give it in carefully monitored doses (usually in the post-surgery setting) but even then patients can be super sensitive to it. So if you give a patient fentanyl and they tell you they can\u2019t breathe, you immediately check the airway, give oxygen. Administer narcan ASAP if it\u2019s severe enough. I imagine as a first responder who regularly deals with people on this drug, they would know that too? \n\nContinuing to compress the airway of someone who is losing respiratory drive to fentanyl is 100% NOT what you do. Even if you don\u2019t know what they are on and they tell you that they can\u2019t breathe, you check\/assess the patient like it\u2019s real even if you think it\u2019s BS. When I worked in the ED, we had patients all the time saying they were short of breathe or having chest pain and we always took them seriously even if we knew they were probably drug-seeking or just having a panic attack. You never wanna be the person that made the patient wait in the lobby with a chief complaint of shortness of breath that you thought was BS and it turned out to be real. For us, you for sure would get fired for that shit or lose your license. It might be criminal negligence.\n\nBeing on a prone (facedown) position already inhibits the lungs and diaphragm the room to expand properly and get air. Then also holding pressure to the neck for 9 mins? I mean, you can\u2019t tell me someone couldn\u2019t have checked a pulse right there? Wasn\u2019t he handcuffed already?

I'm very-much in support of his national plans, and I'm behind the Democrats in Congress. \n\nHowever, this idea of abolishing the Filibuster is absolutely short-sighted and ultimately a bad idea. \n\nRight now, we (the Democratic party) have a government trifecta, and so the idea of streamlining policies seems like a great idea. We can get *so much accomplished* when we would otherwise just have more partisan gridlock. I recognize the upside to repealing it at this moment; don't think I don't. \n\n* **However** \n\nOne thing is an absolute fact: the Republicans will regain the majority at some point in the future. To think that the Democrats are going to hold the majority in the senate for the rest of time is insanity. Majorities change. They've changed after Watergate, since Vietnam, since anything. Majorities never hold power in perpetuity. \n\nThe Republicans (presumably later this decade\/next decade when they get it together and become a classical party again) will one day hold the Senate majority. Do you not think Mitch Mcconnell is going to have an absolute field-day with this new 1-party power? Just consider it. If we repeal the Filibuster; the moment a Republican gets nominated as majority leader, this country's national policy will immediately shift far-to-mid-Right overnight with no way for a minority (us, in that case) to have our voices heard. \n\nTL;DR: I'm not saying the Democrats don't stand to gain enormously from the abolishment of the Senate filibuster, but we can't put that toothpaste back in the tube.

I thought I was giving them the opportunity to detail what they believed and why, but I instead received parroted responses of common far-right talking points with no indication that they took the time to read my responses.\n\nI don't believe the phrase \"you can't reason with some people\" and genuinely what to know how others have handled similar situations. We are cordial enough when we meet in person; I also know them to be generous and good-hearted people. However, the only thing I see them use their facebook accounts for is to continuously share far-right memes that have become increasingly violent and bigoted. More than anything I'm sad that I seem to be losing family members to what I perceive to be a political cult.\n\nI have the opportunity to see them this summer and I am on the fence whether to avoid the family gathering or to attend and pretend as if the exchange never happened. My family is what you would call \"mid-west nice\" and conflict avoidant, so I know my aunt and uncle won't bring it up while I'm there.

This is not a large portion of the population\n\n\\- We are offering this to roughly 44.7M people and\/or a total of $1.7T in student debt.\n\nLets assume that the full 100% of the estimated student debt isn't relieved but just a majority.  So we are going to add ANOTHER $1.25T to our national debt to relieve 18% of the population?  And we think this will \"save\" a lot of people and stimulate the economy?  $1.25T is pretty much what our first infrastructure package was to help THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, this helps 18%.\n\nThis needs to start by addressing the problem first.  Student loan originators and the schools themselves need to be put into check first and foremost, I want to illustrate with a personal story I had the pleasure of going through with a close friend of mine.\n\nI wanted to help a friend of mine deal with one of these student loan entities, Navient which is one of the larger ones.  Scenario was they had to go into bankruptcy for a completely unrelated reason to student loans back in 2012.  Once he came out of the bankruptcy this loan popped back up on his radar and it was actually a loan he took out for his daughters college schooling.  He shared all the info with me and it is unbelievable the liberties Navient took upon themselves during this time.  It actually stated on the invoice\/bill to them directly under the \"Interest Rate\" line item that \"Interest rates on private loans are set by the lender\" so it was set to 11.75%.....are you goddamn fucking for real?  So you just get to set whatever fucking rate you want to?!  Man, I should go out and be a student loan broker....holy fucking shit.  So after I found this out I figured we would be able to call them and negotiate a lower principal buydown if we paid everything right now....as most collection agencies work.  NOPE!  No leniency, he needs to pay it in full either now or later....it doesn't matter we just need the full amount with all interest.\n\nThis is all part of the bigger problem.  Schools jack up their rates because they know any kid will get approved for an educational loan because, well fuck, the banks know \"we want the US to get more educated so we will approve anything and the federal loan process allows us to collect from them till the day they die so here, take $200K, we know we will get it back.\".  It's a fucking self fulfilling prophecy that, for some reason, the feds back the banks making sure this albatross will be around their necks forever AND they can dictate what the interest rate will be?   \n\nI get that I am illustrating the whole point some people believe why relieving student debt is a must but it's not the right way to do this.  Fix the systemic problem first otherwise it will continue down this path and help nobody.  People who were willing to take out a loan like this should still be responsible for the loan, they agreed to the more simple terms of knowing you were taking out a large amount money to pay for education.  If we want to look at rolling back the clock and putting a cap on the interest rate, that makes sense and I could get behind that but just throwing \\~$1.25T at this problem seems frivolous.  I hear people on the very posts about canceling student debt talking about how they would, in turn, go buy a car and a house entering into another form of loan\/debt.  If you were willing to enter into a student loan over your head to begin with I don't have a ton of faith those same people will go buy a house or car within their means and large defaults on loans absolutely does not stimulate the economy.  There just needs to be some sort of level of accountability from all levels; loanors, loanees and the educational instituation.\n\nSorry if this sounds like a rant, it kind of is but I wanted to justify my thoughts behind it and hear others thoughts as well."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1618250790,"title":"Is Manchin lying when he says he won't weaken the Filibuster?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"NovaSentinle","created_utc":1618251945,"title":"Well this ought to bring back some memories","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1618252049,"title":"Looking Back at the Trump Era - Another Republican Insider Joins the Trump Cult","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1618252874,"title":"Analysis: Biden strengthens Obama's legacy while seeking his own","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1618254114,"title":"Why haven't the Democrat senators got together and discussed with Manchin and the others about reforming the filibuster?","num_comments":4,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1618254344,"title":"Cornyn draws criticism for tweet questioning if Biden 'really in charge'","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"johnnymonicker","created_utc":1618257207,"title":"COVID & THE STATUS QUO","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1618259264,"title":"It is time to quit meeting in the middle.

I'm beginning to believe and have doubts about COIVD-19, the vaccine, and the current state of the government. I'm looking for the voice of reason here. I don't want to indoctrinate myself and need some fact checking, logical reasoning, and persuasion back to a realistic perspective of our country. \n\nHere are major points of correction: \n\n\\- The contents of the COVID vaccine; can we trust that the vaccine is safe? Does it contain harmful substances? The government is pushing the vaccine hard, can we trust what they say or is this another case of lobbying and\/or government\/corporate propaganda? Are the \"jacking\" the vaccine, adding additional ingredients they aren't telling us? It comes down to this; is the vaccine safe to take?\n\n\\- Coronavirus has a >\\~2% fatality rate, is it really worth it to shut down the economy? The economic impact of COVID is costing many jobs, how are people supposed to pay for rent, food, utilities? Even with stimulus from the government people are still struggling. Is this just a plot against the people?\n\nI'm looking for facts, not a right wing eco chamber to indorenate me further. Can I trust government sentiment? In our modern world there is an influx of information and its hard to tell what's true and what's false. Please correct the misinformation that has plagued me, I need a realist view of our current government. \n\n\\*This is not trolling. I am not looking to debate.

He did, however, insist that only those who had thought about issues rationally and deeply should be let near a vote. \n\nWe have forgotten this distinction between an intellectual democracy and a democracy by birthright. We have given the vote to all without connecting it to that of wisdom. \n\nAnd Socrates knew exactly where that would lead: to a system the Greeks feared above all, demagoguery. d\u0113mos \u2018the people\u2019 + ag\u014dgos \u2018leading Ancient Athens had painful experience of demagogues, for example, the louche figure of Alcibiades, a rich, charismatic, smooth-talking wealthy man who eroded basic freedoms and helped to push Athens to its disastrous military adventures in Sicily. \n\nSocrates knew how easily people seeking election could exploit our desire for easy answers. He asked us to imagine an election debate between two candidates, one who was like a doctor and the other who was like a sweet shop owner. \n\nThe sweet shop owner would say of his rival: *Look, this person here has worked many evils on you. He hurts you, gives you bitter potions and tells you not to eat and drink whatever you like. He\u2019ll never serve you feasts of many and varied pleasant things like I will.*\n\nSocrates asks us to consider the audience response: Do you think the doctor would be able to reply effectively? The true answer \u2013 \u2018I cause you trouble, and go against you desires in order to help you\u2019 would cause an uproar among the voters, don\u2019t you think? \n\nWe have forgotten all about Socrates\u2019s salient warnings against democracy. We have preferred to think of democracy as an unambiguous good \u2013 rather than a process that is only ever as effective as the education system that surrounds it. **As a result, we have elected many sweet shop owners, and very few doctors**"},{"author":"Fast_Simple_1815","created_utc":1618930861,"title":"Maxine Waters says she won\u2019t be \u2018bullied\u2019 by Republicans over Chauvin remarks | Democrats","num_comments":210,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1618931077,"title":"BACKFIRE: Judge says Maxine Waters\\&#039; \\&#039;confrontational\\&#039; comments could appeal a verdict","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"datewaynet","created_utc":1618931169,"title":"BACKFIRE: Judge says Maxine Waters confrontational comments could appeal a verdict","num_comments":13,"description":""},{"author":"doinmybest4now","created_utc":1618931613,"title":"Good morning America!

Not surprising: in my own personal experience training\/volunteering with them in the Midwest, the Red Cross is still full of homophobes in many parts of the country...) but is still effectively a ban on any sexually-active gay man, or bisexual man currently in a same-sex relationship, from giving blood.\n\nThis article discusses it:\n\nhttps:\/\/georgetownvoice.com\/2021\/04\/17\/gay-men-cant-donate-blood\/\n\nThis ban, because that's what it really is, needs to stop.  It must end.\n\nAs hospitals cried out desperately for blood during the height of this pandemic, it was extremely discouraging knowing, for instance, that as I tried to drag my homophobic father by the ear to give blood with me, I (a only partly out-of-closet bisexual: my father doesn't know) could face some very awkward conversations with a homophobic Red Cross nurse that might risk alerting my nosy father, if I tried to give...  (as it happens I hadn't had any sexual contact with ANYONE in the 3 months before that, and my last sexual relationship had been with a woman anyways: in fact I've been largely abstinent my entire life both due to my own religious reasons\/concerns with too much premarital or homosexual sex, and due to having incredible difficulty being accepted in dating...)\n\nThis ban coats lives.  It discourages people from giving when there is absolutely no reason for it.  In fact, that liason with a woman I hadn't known long (from internet dating, and SHE was the one who got things sexual by the way) and could have carried any of numerous STD's (condoms were used, but can break or slip...) was inarguably a LOT riskier than a homosexual married couple who had been in an exclusive relationship 20 years would be...\n\nThe fact I could've donated the day after screwing a random girl from Tinder who I barely knew, if I wanted, but a committed homosexusl couple would be barred from donating blood for 3 ENTIRE MONTHS after having sex (which, let's face it, no real couple is going to go that long without... so it's effectively a ban) is absolutely incorrigible.\n\nBiden is in office.  Moderate Democrats CLAIM to want to save lives in this pandemic- and the next one.\n\nAnd a blood shortage costs lives every day (I would know: I'm a biologist and a pre-med, taking my 2nd and 3rd Master's at a Med School- I have shadowed doctors, worked EMS, and have a LOT of academic and incidental exposure to the medical system).  So why don't we get this fixed?"},{"author":"TheSexNigerian","created_utc":1619327417,"title":"Remember him","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"shidcumpoobstinky","created_utc":1619327874,"title":"Cum","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Glc12345","created_utc":1619340034,"title":"Caitlyn Jenner killed someone with her car.

I think this claim is obsolete in the Trump Era. I predict that President Biden's party will gain seats because of his popularity.\n\nOf course, if you are a Democrat, you already know that Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932 and took office in 1933. So you already know that the 1934 mid-terms was a referendum on FDR's first 100 days and first year in office. What you probably don't know is the results.\n\n From Wiki:\n\nThe Democrats built on the Congressional majorities they had won in the previous two elections. In the [House of Representatives](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_House_of_Representatives), Roosevelt's party gained nine seats, mostly from the [Republican Party](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Republican_Party_(United_States)). The Democrats also gained nine seats in the [U.S. Senate](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Senate), thereby winning a supermajority. A [Progressive](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wisconsin_Progressive_Party) also unseated a Republican in the Senate. This marked the first time since the [Civil War](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Civil_War) that an incumbent president's party gained seats in a midterm election, followed by [1998](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_1998) and [2002](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2002).\n\nThe election was perhaps the most successful midterm of the 20th century for the party in control of the presidency.\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1934\\_United\\_States\\_elections](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1934_United_States_elections)"},{"author":"RDHereImsorryAoi","created_utc":1619579555,"title":"So any biden voter","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"dadono04","created_utc":1619579686,"title":"Why don\u2019t we do this ???","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1619580013,"title":"I mean he's not wrong...","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"thatpj","created_utc":1619580874,"title":"Exclusive: Read Anita Dunn's memo to Democrats","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"AndreDaGamer","created_utc":1619581287,"title":"Joe Biden\u2019s First 100 Days Reshaped America","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"DoremusJessup","created_utc":1619581676,"title":"New York Post Reporter Who Wrote False Kamala Harris Story Resigns: The Post reporter who wrote the original article said she had resigned from the paper because of \u201can incorrect story I was ordered to write,\u201d describing the episode as \u201cmy breaking point.\u201d","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"Schwinn_86","created_utc":1619586092,"title":"Please help","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"cloud665","created_utc":1619587239,"title":"The war on poverty failed due to big government","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"Jeffreyxu0927","created_utc":1619587862,"title":"If only","num_comments":91,"description":""},{"author":"Stpetesolidarity","created_utc":1619588030,"title":"St. Pete FL on Saturday!","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1619589621,"title":"AOC on the first 100 days: 'Biden has definitely exceeded expectations that progressives had' - The Politicus","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1619591006,"title":"Ranked-choice voting is not a proportional voting system.","num_comments":2,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Gott_Riff","created_utc":1619594605,"title":"He is not.","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"Pluto-NO","created_utc":1619595065,"title":"Biden Wants to Take Away All the Hamburgers?!","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"dakandy","created_utc":1619601455,"title":"Biden's first 100 days: What he's gotten done","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"tyw7","created_utc":1619610533,"title":"Reporter resigns from NY Post over Harris book story","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"NORDLAN","created_utc":1619612885,"title":"Right-wing media has pushed 3 completely false narratives in less than a week","num_comments":14,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1619613516,"title":"The most racist President in history. - The Democratic Party","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"CaramelKey5319","created_utc":1619615658,"title":"President Biden Addresses a Joint Session of Congress","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"Blognoggl5","created_utc":1619616450,"title":"Joe Biden is not coming to take your Whopper.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"NORDLAN","created_utc":1619617334,"title":"D.C. police officer says politicians are downplaying \"brutal, savage\" Capitol riot","num_comments":8,"description":""},{"author":"gremlin30","created_utc":1619620298,"title":"Looks like we lost House seats in the census- how likely is it that we lose the House?","num_comments":22,"description":"Idk why people aren\u2019t talking about this more.

In Florida, lawsuits against our new voter suppression law began minutes after it was signed (which our Governor thoughtfully did live on Fox TV). The sponsors so far are The League of Women Voters of Florida, the Black Voters Matter Fund, the Florida Alliance for Retired Americans and numerous individuals. The NAACP filed their own suit.\n\nSo what does this mean to us, the Democrats-in-the-street? It means we need to dig into our pockets again. I know, I know. Many of us are short of cash these days, and not just because of the pandemic. Electing Biden was expensive, and many of us gave as much as we could afford (or even a bit more). But now the activist organizations bringing the suits need to fund them. There is no other way, and speed is important. The 2022 elections are seventeen months away. This case will be decided in the appellant courts, where we can expect our opponents to do everything they can to drag out the proceedings so that the election of 2022 will be decided under unconstitutional rules.\n\nWe need to keep our majorities in the House and Senate. Joe Biden is enormously popular with the American public right now, which will give us an advantage, but we could lose that advantage - and the election - if our voters are turned away at the polls, or can\u2019t even get to them in the first place.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have much money to give, offer to pitch in with the fundraising - events, phone banking, etc. If the lawyers need more individuals to sign of as plaintiffs, do that.\n\nOur effort and turnout in 2020 was record-setting. Joe Biden received more votes than any Presidential candidate in history. We need to hold the same strength and courage in our hearts now."},{"author":"Xolaya","created_utc":1620646803,"title":"The discord link expired.

Joe Manchin is a senator in West Virginia, where the state leans right. The fact that we have a Democrat Senator in that state is a miracle as it is, but people from the far left of the party shits on him. While I share the frustration regarding him not wanting to play ball too hard on the more liberal policies, i dislike the fact that people came to the conclusion that he should be removed and replaced by another Democrat. Well ideally such a move is the best course of action, the main issue is that the demographics of West Virginia doesn\u2019t subscribe to anything further left of Manchin at the moment.\n\nAt this moment in the Senate, we barely have a very slight majority, and instead of trying to push for increasing that margin, The online people are purity testing the party And have an idea where only left-leaning people are the New Democrats. The issue is, the left leaning people are not as popular as the online communities tend to represent. Most of our party are still moderate, hence why Bernie lost the primaries. I feel like the left wing of our party is looking side of our goal, which is to strengthen our position against the other party. Well Joe Manchin is far from the ideal left Democrat senator, the fact that he will play ball with some left-leaning policies is a lot better than the alternative, a republican senator in West Virginia. \n\nI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this. But thoughts?\n\nEdit:People seem to not read my whole rant so I\u2019ll just put a TLDR\n\n TLDR: It\u2019s very stupid to get rid of Joe ManChin and try to put a more liberal senator in West Virginia because West Virginia is  further right. The most realistic alternative to Joe Manchin is a Republican senator. At least Manchin can play ball, Where a Republican won\u2019t. Instead, we should focus more on increasing the seats Democrats occupy, so Manchin not playing ball would be less significant"},{"author":"Few_Whole7407","created_utc":1620806531,"title":"Voter ID?

This has probably happened in the past, I'm sure of this, but not to this degree. I'm relatively new to politics only starting to really pay attention in 2019, but recently it's disgusting how people blame biden for literally anything that happens. Gas went up after a private company for hacked. Biden's fault Israel and Palestine are fighting again. Biden's fault\nChick fil a is only offering 1 sauce for your chicken sandwich (and Ted Cruz retweeted this blaming democrats) once again biden's fault somehow. Hell if someone is mad they can't get a girlfriend they will somehow blame it on biden. \n\nThis isn't just aimed at republicans, I am shocked on how many everyday people who aren't really into politics but still voice an opinion have the slightest clue on what's happening, maybe just read a headline  and just assume it's bidens fault without researching. I've had this happen with my friends where I have to explain to them what's wrong with their claim. This has caused me to be thinking very negatively about the overall average American and how they don't have the common sense to just open the article and not just read the headline and scroll.

Population per member of the House of Representatives, Population per member of the Senate and Population per Electoral College vote.","num_comments":22,"description":"I'll post the entire data table at the bottom but for comparison I will highlight the 5 most and least represented states in every category.\n\nI broke this down into 3 categories. Population per member of the House of Representatives, Population per member of the Senate and Population per Electoral College vote.\n\nJust to lay some ground info here are the five most and least populous states as we will see them a bit. For comparisons sake I am including Washington DC in all statistics except senate as they have 0 representatives. \n\nIf D.C. is included in a top\/bottom five I will make it six because the argument can be made they don't count due to not being a state.\n\n**Most Populous**\n\n* 1. California - 39,512,223      11.91% of the United States\n* 2. Texas - 28,995,881      8.74% of the United States\n* 3. Florida - 21,477,737      6.47% of the United States\n* 4. New York - 19,453,561      5.86% of the United States\n* 5. Illinois - 12,671,821      3.86% of the United States\n\n**Least Populous**\n\n*  51. Wyoming - 578,759      0.17%  of the United States\n*  50. Vermont - 623,989      0.19%  of the United States\n*  49. DC - 705,749      0.21%  of the United States\n*  48. Alaska - 731,545      0.22%  of the United States\n*  47. North Dakota - 762,062      0.23%  of the United States\n*  46. South Dakota - 884,659      0.27%  of the United States\n\nAs we can see **California** is the extreme majority and Wyoming the extreme minority. \n\n**California has 2 millionish more people than Utah, Iowa, Nevada, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kansas, New Mexico, Nebraska, West Virginia, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Maine, Montana, Rhode Island, Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont and Wyoming COMBINED.**\n\nEvery state in the United States is allotted 2 members for the senate. Looking at that previous statistic it's baffling that California which is *representing* so many more people sits with 2 senators while the combined states it outnumbers sit with 42.\n\nWhich brings us to my next data set. \n\n**Population per member of the Senate**\n\nAgain, I am going to highlight the 5 most over represented and least represented states in this regard. As all states are allotted two senators the standing will be identical to the population list.\n\n**Highest Population per Senator**\n\n* 1. California - 19,756,111.5 citizens per senator.\n* 2. Texas - 14,497,940.5 citizens per senator.\n* 3. Florida - 10,738,868.5 citizens per senator.\n* 4. New York - 9,726,780.5 citizens per senator.\n* 5. Illinois - 6,335,910.5 citizens per senator.\n\n**Lowest Population per Senator**\n\n* 50. Wyoming - 289,379.5 citizens per senator.\n* 49. Vermont - 311,994.5 citizens per senator.\n* 48. Alaska - 365,772.5 citizens per senator.\n* 47. North Dakota - 381,031 citizens per senator.\n* 46. South Dakota - 442,329.5 citizens per senator.\n\n(Though Washington D.C. hold a population higher than two states it is not a state and therefore not represented in the Senate.)\n\nBy looking at these numbers we see the extreme overrepresentation of small states in the Senate. Considering a California senator represents 19.7 **million** people while a Wyoming senator represents 0.2 million really highlights the disadvantage large states are put at in the senate. Lets move onto the House of Representatives.\n\n**Population per member of the House of Representatives**\n\n\" Article I, Section II of the Constitution says that each state shall have at least one U.S. Representative, while the total size of a state's delegation to the House depends on its population. The number of Representatives also cannot be greater than one for every thirty thousand people.\"\n\nAlso to be noted. Washington D.C. does have one rep in the House so they will be included in this stat.\n\n**Highest Population per member of the House**\n\n* 1. Montana - 1,068,778 citizens per member of the house. (1 House seat)\n* 2. Delaware - 973,764 citizens per member of the house. (1 House seat)\n* 3. Idaho - 893,532.5 citizens per member of the house. (2 House seats)\n* 4. South Dakota - 884,659 citizens per member of the house. (1 House seat)\n* 5. Oregon - 843,547 citizens per member of the house. (5 house seats)\n\n**Lowest Population per member of the House**\n\n* 51. Rhode Island - 529,680.5 citizens per member of the house. (2 house seats)\n* 50. Wyoming - 578,759 citizens per member of the house. (1 house seat)\n* 49. West Virginia - 597,382.33 citizens per member of the house. (3 house seats)\n* 48. Vermont - 623,989 citizens per member of the house. (1 house seat)\n* 47. Nebraska - 644,802.67 citizens per member of the house. (3 house seats)\n\nThis one is a lot closer as we can see going from the highest to lowest is just over 500,000. About double. Compared to the senate where the highest is **68 times** the lowest.\n\n**Population per Electoral College vote**\n\n**\"** Electoral votes are allocated among the States based on the Census. Every State is allocated a number of votes equal to the number of senators and representatives in its U.S. Congressional delegation\u2014two votes for its senators in the U.S. Senate plus a number of votes equal to the number of its Congressional districts.\" Let's see how well represented each state is.\n\nWashington D.C. is worth three electoral votes and therefore will be included in this statistic.\n\n**Highest Population per Electoral College vote**\n\n* 1. Texas - 763,049 citizens per Electoral College vote. (38 Electoral College votes)\n* 2. Florida - 740,611.62 citizens per Electoral College vote. (29 Electoral College votes)\n* 3. California - 718,404.05 citizens per Electoral College vote. (55 Electoral College votes)\n* 4. North Carolina - 699,205.6 citizens per Electoral College vote. (15 Electoral College votes)\n* 5. New York - 670,812.45 citizens per Electoral College vote. (29 Electoral College votes) \n\n**Lowest Population per Electoral College vote**\n\n* 51. Wyoming - 192,919.67 citizens per Electoral College vote. (3 Electoral College votes)\n* 50. Vermont - 207,996.33 citizens per Electoral College vote. (3 Electoral College votes\n* 49. D.C. - 235,249.67 citizens per Electoral College vote. (3 Electoral College votes)\n* 48. Alaska - 243,848.33 citizens per Electoral College vote. (3 Electoral College votes)\n* 47. North Dakota - 254,020.67 citizens per Electoral College vote. (3 Electoral College votes)\n* 46. Rhode Island - 264,840.25 citizens per Electoral College vote. (4 Electoral College votes)\n\nWe see in the Electoral College that smaller states tend to be overrepresented. A man voting in Wyoming is equal to about 3.95 men voting in Texas.

I run an election forecast for the 2022 Senate Election - and I have a strong track record. In the last cycle, my projections were closer than Nate Silver, and I got over 93% of states right. \n\nThis year, the single best predictor of Democrats winning the Senate in my forecast is their ability to defend these states. Across 50,000 simulations, when Democrats win all four, they hold on to the majority 99.7% of the time. When they even lose one, that falls down to 60.1%. Lose two - and they are in dire straits, and only win 12.7% of the time. The reality is, by the time they lose one or two states, they probably aren't going to be able to pull off an upset outside of Pennsylvania. It would be amazing to win that 51st and 52nd seat, but the most important thing is to hold a majority in the Senate for the rest of Biden's term. \n\nPeople seem to really be overlooking New Hampshire and Nevada, but those states are particularly vulnerable and could easily be lost. If you want to learn more, feel free to check out my forecast at [racetothewh.com\/senate](https:\/\/racetothewh.com\/senate).

Who also oppose the For the People Act, who voted against the American Rescue Plan, who will vote against the American Jobs Act, and who are protecting the filibuster. Those senators deserve a proportional share of the blame - the vast majority.\n\nSo by all means, be angry at Joe Manchin. Remember what we're so close to achieving. Fight for better. But do not ever give Republicans a pass. Do not play into Republican hands. I'm already seeing bad faith actors exploiting Manchin to promote staying home in 2022, and it's just nonsense. Senate Republicans are explicitly obstructing the Democratic agenda; hold *them* responsible. Don't blame *two* Democrats for obstructionism of *fifty* Republican.\n\nPrioritize the real opposition. Our political strategizing must be based around the world in which we live, not the world in which we might wish to live.

Voters risked their very lives to vote in order to pass voting rights legislation and use the one shot we had to stop our decline into fascism. We won the Democrats the majority...barely. \n\nAnd here we are once again having members of our own party block out ability from protecting our Democracy. Repubs have taken 2020 and rammed bill after bill to make voting harder through across our country and the Senate does shit. \n\nWhy even try? Why stay hopeful? Republicans are winning as the minority,  why am I or others supposed to keep fighting?"},{"author":"JoeyRnB","created_utc":1623166773,"title":"Obama makes rare appearance to DEMOLISH Republicans [Brian Tyler Cohen on YouTube]","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"DoremusJessup","created_utc":1623167501,"title":"The Koch network has been pressuring Sen.

Also, I rounded the numbers):\n\n2008:  President:  Obama over McCain by 14,000 votes\n\nGovernor:  Perdue (D) over McRory (R) by 145,000 votes\n\nSenator:  Hagan (D) over Dole (R) by  362,000 votes\n\nSenator (2010 midterms):  Burr (R) over Marshall (D) by 313,000 votes\n\n\\--------------\n\n2012:  President:  Romney over Obama by 92,000 votes\n\nGovernor:  McRory (R) over Dalton (D) by 510,000 votes\n\nSenator (2014):  Tillis (R) over Hagan (D) by 46,000 votes\n\n\\---------------\n\n2016:  President:  Trump over Clinton by 173,000 votes\n\nGovernor:  Cooper (D) over McCrory (R) by 10,277 votes\n\nSenator:  Burr (R) over Ross (D) by 267,000 votes\n\n\\---------------\n\n2020:  President:  Trump over Biden by 74,000 votes\n\nGovernor:  Cooper (D) over Forrest (R) by 248,000 votes\n\nSenator:  Tillis (R) over Cunningham (D) by 96,000 votes\n\n\\----------------\n\nLooks bad, huh?  But not so fast:  Let's look at some background:\n\n2008 doesn't really need much defending as the Democrats pretty much swept the state.  2010 and 2012 were during that Tea Party backlash.  Bev Perdue was a disaster as a governor and decided not to run in JANUARY of 2012, leaving her Lt. Governor Walter \"Who the hell are you?\" Dalton to run.\n\nBefore we get to the next block of elections, remember that in 2013, the Supreme Court repealed Sections 5 and 4b of the voting rights act, which means that starting in 2013 NC just started squiggling  gerrymander lines and passing voter suppression laws whenever and wherever the fuck they wanted.\n\n2016 was...well, the faults of Hillary Clinton's campaign have been laid bare repeatedly over the last 4ish years so we don't need to go into that.  But, at the same time Clinton was getting LAID OUT by Trump, Roy Cooper managed to squeak by Pat \"I see you pee\" McCrory.  Burr dominated Ross, but he was an incumbent that was latched onto the Trump Train.\n\nAnd now 2020!  Yes, Trump won again (remember what I said about the gerrymandering?), but look at how much Cooper won over Forrest:  nearly 250,000 votes.  The gap between him and Forrest was twenty five times what he had in 2016, when he barely eked out ahead.  As far as Tillis and Cunningham, Cunningham was leading the charge until he met the downfall of a surprisingly large amount of NC politicians:  he got caught cheating on his wife.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nThere are 16 electoral votes in North Carolina.  More and more people are moving here every day, I just can't fathom why the kind of political pressure we see in Georgia and Texas isn't being applied here where it can have some very real results.\n\nEdit:  We have 16 electoral votes now, not 15."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1624199302,"title":"We need our girl Kamala!!

I have come to the inescapable conclusion that democracy in American is grave peril. Without a concentrated effort of the masses, this will sadly come to pass. I am but a simple man, a thinking man, and a man of the people. My endless ponderings have concocted a scheme so simple, so ingenious, that God himself will laugh at its dependability. How do we Americans say democracy from the scourge of Republican voter suppression efforts? Simple really. Change your voter registration to Republican. Do it this week. Do after reading this post. Don\u2019t delay. Repost this memo everywhere on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. E-mail this to all of your acquaintances. \u201cHow will this work\u201d, I hear you smirking now. But let ask you this. Complex gerrymandering algorithms will be thrown into chaos. The RNC will start throwing away millions in ad revenue on the wrong races in the wrong states. Democrats will be able to vote in Republican primaries and separate out the Qanon riff raft. For the good of Democracy, you must register as Republican. Change the result, without changing the decided past. That past has been decided. But conversely, that means that's all that has been decided. \n\nDeceive the Republicans.  \n\nDeceive the world.  \n\nThat is the choice you must now make. \n\nI pray for your success, you insane mad Democrats.

Our first guest will be the co-founder and executive director of EveryDistrict, Nicole Hobbs. EveryDistrict published a comprehensive 40 year plan that aligns very closely with many of the New Iowa Project's goals. Many volunteers statewide sent us a link to the report, so we were thrilled to invite Nicole to join us to talk about it.

Our second guest will be Auditor Rob Sand. He'll talk about his work as our state auditor and, most importantly, give an overview of his perspective as a statewide candidate. We'll also feature an extensive training from Judy Downs on how local groups and county parties can get involved in city council and school board campaigns. From recruiting candidates to building a county mail and phonebanking program to chasing ballots, we'll cover it all. Democrats in Iowa have traditionally been leery of getting involved in local races. But it's an amazing way to increase Democratic representation, build the bench, and keep volunteer operations humming year round. And - let's be honest - Republicans have been getting involved in local races and eating our lunch on it for several decades. It's way past due to start fighting back. All Democrats are welcome!\n\n**June 26, 2021**  \n**2:00 PM-** [**Scott County Neighbor-to-Neighbor Training**](https:\/\/r20.rs6.net\/tn.jsp?f=001hBzdRD5wclJvys4P-rRVV0wokcSGeF86TqUoSYoiQ6I3VRoE4PZrsZKghcHGdgBuKe7VfE2lYiYK7MpHL7t3fxwEFfXIE0vHnfLtQDArubq2fS7mP0eXGEjzPq3F8K4mBXl0m46nfMb0_RtodNu4Oc8C55evLQw4BqrSU7dzsGjRY9hNIUUV9w==&c=aUZXjOyIdrOFwdflM1pskR9iufCn6puqh180c4162bZZTYbHcc92xQ==&ch=EBdhf-7pn2v-mDFDfZOQxo196kXjbDWYSlQ-3oifhnUQxcGX0LCbcQ==)\n\n* **Meeting Link**: [Register Here](https:\/\/r20.rs6.net\/tn.jsp?f=001hBzdRD5wclJvys4P-rRVV0wokcSGeF86TqUoSYoiQ6I3VRoE4PZrsZKghcHGdgBu0ndoTPB5xPUBdL8idaifZGfmo-z6iyvdw5rX10xVfJ39PRXiMuhpldxcKWLLYvlHIOO5riMIovUFLBZ3WeAulHVmdPvLmL-3knqWehCANgdHRjAvGYNuKnw-MRGl_h4YCN2XTpuRAk-fxiifj6sU3wFsRf12wHsnn8Yc0HKppb5EiMySMNwc15KjUJFZzQqsODa0Q75P0GFxrfIxLAG5Hs5FqJGn97Ci9uqV3HCAYOnjqqTK6QfGwNyJglsinY19XFm73LV1hExSZLAySBYZ9XAGrm2dBjJnCzSurYYdBF-lcn5V5oY6DOSd59J6fIJ8zZTGqBEA9V8t99KFxvKMHaBPYLJvdDbhEAXL2F9B0kCRGTEurDFzla5otLRZtsbQLvIFp1W92GNGPUIfI3tJhEaa__zxSt9mSjE4K58JrrQfj_JEF2eDO2BB9eok_v0BgUklQTLkl1jfxhB7vT-ETaLIF9yx-XcWLQv3afRyk-osDhcPOeU6_if9vK14o072A4Yt8Nm4OyjU0UrrTHwuYw==&c=aUZXjOyIdrOFwdflM1pskR9iufCn6puqh180c4162bZZTYbHcc92xQ==&ch=EBdhf-7pn2v-mDFDfZOQxo196kXjbDWYSlQ-3oifhnUQxcGX0LCbcQ==)\n* Details: Keep the momentum going!

This group has ties to Oath Keepers, Cliven Bundy, Jan. 6 insurrectionists and extremist Spokane-area activist Matt Shea. The counties will be contributing taxpayer funds to this group\u2019s activities.\n\nWhat consequences should there be, if any? Should state governments withhold funds from seditious counties? Perhaps it might even be possible to dissolve the county altogether and either merge it into a neighboring (larger, blue) county, or place the region directly under state authority. There might be a local backlash but because most of these places are sparsely populated, it likely won\u2019t be massive. At the very least it would serve as a warning to other jurisdictions about what would happen if they do the same thing.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps there should be a way of dealing with similar behavior from town\/city governments or their officials (mayors, etc). In this case, perhaps the opposite course of action (dissolving the city into the county it is in, rather than dissolving the county as described above) would be possible."},{"author":"JoeyRnB","created_utc":1624585167,"title":"Giuliani\u2019s son MELTS DOWN on camera after Rudy loses law license [Brian Tyler Cohen on YouTube]","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1624585325,"title":"Rich white man Biden should step up to the plate and donate every cent of his presidential salary just like Trump did.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1624585862,"title":"Joe Biden Is Confirming Judges Faster Than Decades Of Past Presidents","num_comments":39,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1624586298,"title":"Supreme Court makes awful awful ruling","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"imll99","created_utc":1624587197,"title":"Trump told top military officials to 'shoot' protesters in the leg and 'crack their skulls,' new books claims","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1624588880,"title":"45","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"-Omegamart-","created_utc":1624594633,"title":"More Americans Now Socially Liberal Than Conservative For First Time, Poll Finds","num_comments":58,"description":""},{"author":"BoxLanky4460","created_utc":1624601500,"title":"Would you have sex with a black guy to show solidarity for BLM?

Like Biden said, it's exploitation.  When there is a lack of competition for workers, employers are free to dictate low wages and poor working conditions.\n\nWhen there is a lack of competition for consumers, prices skyrocket- just look what's happened to the price of Insulin (a medicine for which the base patent long since expired: but corporate consolidation eventually led to only a few big companies in the US manufacturing, all charging astronomical prices very recently...)\n\nThus, Biden's actions to encourage competition, to break up monopolies and near-monopolies, and to reduce barriers to entry into markets all move in the right direction: and could help restore the health of the American economy; which has suffered a slow rot at its roots from a dying middle class, stagnant wages, and rising prices.\n\nI do not think these actions will be nearly successful enough in the long run, but they are a step in the right direction.\n\nI encourage discussion of Biden's recent actions, speeches, etc."},{"author":"amnred103","created_utc":1626142282,"title":"All you have to do is lie","num_comments":38,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626142555,"title":"Ethical Quote Of The Week: Donald Trump","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626145174,"title":"It's true.","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Agitated-Ad6744","created_utc":1626145741,"title":"Get yourselves together!","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"flatworldart","created_utc":1626145930,"title":"Opinion piece quick","num_comments":1,"description":"I wanted to express that in my opinion this is a weird world and people are weird too.

Here's the Full Top Five.","num_comments":1,"description":"At [**RacetotheWH.com**](https:\/\/www.racetothewh.com\/senate), I\u2019m running a Senate Forecast that predicts the result of the 2022 election, using a combination of historical data, polling, fundraising, the experience levels of the respective candidates. In 2020, it was one of the most accurate in the nation, finishing closer to the final result on average than Nate Silver.\n\nToday, the single most competitive race in the nation is Pennsylvania, which is an almost straight down the middle tossup. Democrats have a 52% chance of flipping the seat. The state has voted 2.6% more towards Republicans than the national popular vote in recent cycles, but Democrats have the edge because they had stronger and more experienced candidates running in the primaries. John Fetterman, the early Democratic frontrunner, is the current Lieutenant Governor. He has a 5-7% lead against his two most likely Republican opponents.\n\nOn paper, 2022 is a remarkably competitive election cycle, with both Democrats and Republicans holding seats that easily flip parties\n\nHere\u2019s the rest of the top five:\n\n2. Georgia \u2014 Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock \u2014 \u00a0Democrats 63% chance to win, Republicans 37%\n\n3. North Carolina \u2014 Open Seat (Republican Held) \u2014 Democrats 34%, Republicans 66%\n\n4. Arizona \u2014 Democratic Senator Mark Kelly \u2014 Democrats 67% Chance, Republicans 33%\n\n5.

By now, people are either going to be reliable Democrats going forward, are completely dedicated to the GOP and their propaganda, or are \"undecided\".  My theory is that the undecideds are where the focus of candidates should be in swing elections.  These are the people who are generally disengaged from the news and politics but have heard the GOP propaganda for so long that they \"lean\" toward the GOP candidates when voting because they \"heard\" xyz about the Democrats.  So when it comes time to vote, they will typically vote for the GOP candidate because they think they heard bad things about the Democrat.  In swing areas, I think candidates should hijack many of the GOP strategies (at least in the early parts of the campaign).  Focus almost all efforts on everything they HAVEN'T done for the region and accuse them of spending all of their time \"playing politics\" while the constituents struggle.  Also, (in some regions this will help more than others) talk about guns.  Cite January 6th as an important reason to support RESPONSIBLE and LEGAL gun ownership.  Again, the undecideds are who we're focusing on here.  They're just as disturbed as the rest of us over what transpired on that day.  I think it would be eye opening for an undecided voter to hear a Democrat talking about gun ownership.  Finally, if you go to church, talk about it!  Again, blow up the whole \"godless liberal\" idea because it's mostly NOT TRUE!\n\nIt's time to turn things upside down and beat them at their own game.  You're not going to flip a state or district from red to blue by repeating the same talking points.  Reliable Democrats already know what Democratic candidates stand for and don't need to hear it again.  If you spend a lot of time talking about raising taxes on the wealthy or gun control, undecided voters will take that as confirmation of everything they've already \"heard\" about Democrats.  Undecided voters are generally not engaged which is why the GOP keeps their message simple and it largely works.  For the love of God, let's flip more elections!"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626372878,"title":"Tucker: Ballot audit in Fulton County Georgia","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"NanaBoatemaa","created_utc":1626372994,"title":"How Cuba Protest And Riots, 2021 Begun (Unreported)","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"sillychillly","created_utc":1626373221,"title":"This budget reconciliation bill is the most consequential piece of legislation since the 1930s.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626374460,"title":"How could that have happened!?","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"thyusername","created_utc":1626375391,"title":"Court Denies Republican Request to Dismiss Arizona Audit Case","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1626375665,"title":"GOP fumes over Schumer hardball strategy","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"yanks28th","created_utc":1626375868,"title":"2022 Senate Forecast - Democrats Chances of Holding Senate Rise to 56% - RacetotheWH","num_comments":11,"description":""},{"author":"DoremusJessup","created_utc":1626375954,"title":"Texas Should Be a Warning to Democrats Everywhere","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"eci-inc","created_utc":1626377693,"title":"The U.S. Surgeon General Is Calling COVID-19 Misinformation An 'Urgent Threat'","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626380967,"title":"An Epidemic of Violence: a State of Emergency Has Been Imposed in New York","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"eci-inc","created_utc":1626381006,"title":"A Teacher Got Fired for Presenting the Poem \u201cWhite Privilege\u201d in Class.

Why Abbott Axed Staff Salaries, and An Appeal For Help","num_comments":3,"description":"**(not so brief) Primer on TX SB7\/SB1)**\n\nFor those unaware or only partially in the know about what\u2019s happening in Texas, the GOP has unified control of the State government, which they\u2019re using to try to pass the most nakedly political, implicitly racist, and 1950s-esque restrictive voting rights bill called the Election Integrity and Security Act. They\u2019ve been working on it since March, recently reformed and reconciled it, so that it\u2019s ready for \u201cFloor Action\u201d in the House\u2026 the final step before it goes to Gov. Abbott\u2019s desk. \n\nDemocrats can\u2019t filibuster it, except by denying the House a quorum, or total number of electors necessary, to proceed. The governor threatened to have them detained by the Rangers and forced into the House. So, they fled the State en masse to prevent this bill from passing, unable\/unwilling to return until the GOP drops this awful bill. \n\nSo why is it so awful that House members are willing to leave their jobs and loved ones for potentially months? Here are five reason why\u2026\n\n**1. Sunday Early Voting would now be limited to only 1pm-9pm** \n\nIf that seems innocuous, at first, Let me explain how it\u2019s some explicitly racist BS meant to decrease minority turnout. Church is big in Texas, whether you\u2019re white or black, but in many black communities the church often also serves as a focal point for the community (I\u2019m white, so if I\u2019m wrong, please lmk\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t affect this next part). There\u2019s an operation in Texas, and all over the South, called \u201cSouls to the Polls,\u201d where following services, buses would  take the congregation straight to an early polling site. Church services DO NOT end at 1pm. They end much earlier. It\u2019s one of the most effective means of driving black voter turnout, and the RNC intentionally and capriciously wants to end it with this unjustifiable change that\u2019s a Prima Facie example of 21st century racism. \n\n **NOTE** this language goes back to SB7, which was overwhelmingly supported but faced a media backlash and is tenuously constitutional. The most recent version to be voted on, SB7, has excluded this particular language (except granting the county election clerk of <30k counties flexibility in setting hours if there isn\u2019t a signed petition). \n\nHOWEVER, the GOP doesn\u2019t roll over that easily, this bill would still change the definition of \u201cearly voting place\u201d to mean \u201can office regularly maintained for conducting general clerical functions of the county clerk,\u201d and would disallow parties from requesting temporary polling sites; giving the counties total discretion over their location. If the county is GOP controlled, you bet those sites will be far away from the nearest church. \n\n**2) BANS DRIVE-THRU VOTING**\n\nUnlike #1 this language survives in SB1. A polling site MAY NOT be located in a tent or any temporary site. If you want to vote from your car, you must a) be alone and b) have a valid medical reason to do so. \n\nDrive-thru voting was overwhelmingly used by democratic voters in 2020. Especially in cities. That\u2019s why the GOP fought tooth and nail to get the court to grant an injunction against their use in Harris County.\n\nJust another way of making voting more difficult. \n\n**3) public officials CANNOT send unsolicited vote-by-mail applications**\n\n\u201cThe early voting clerk may make no attempt to solicit a person to complete an application\nfor an early voting ballot by mail, whether directly or through a third party.\u201d This is a trend in red states. In 2020, the majority of States, and several counties in Texas, proactively sent vote-by-mail applications. Well, as you can guess, Texas wasn\u2019t happy with the whopping 973,000 ballots (out of like 13m) they received by mail. They don\u2019t release party ID numbers, but you can guess which way these ballots leaned (there would\u2019ve been even more if Harris County\u2019s conservative election judge hadn\u2019t shot down the county\u2019s plan to do so). Now, no county can send out ballots proactively, not even to those over 65 (GOP\u2019s loss if passed as is). \n\nSo, an applicant must submit an application, signing it with **ink on paper**, and stating his\/her grounds for needing to vote by mail. They would make that more difficult too. In the past, you\u2019d merely state something like \u201ccompromised immune system\u201d or \u201crisk of illness from polling site.\u201d This bill would require either the name of your hospital or the affirmation of a witness of the 2nd degree (so not your mom). As well, in the space right before your signature you must write \u201cI certify that the information given in this application is true, and I understand that giving false information in this application is a crime.\" \n\nTheir goal is obviously to limit vote by mail as much as possible. *Interestingly*, the new text does allow for \u201ca political party or a candidate for voting office [to] distribute an application form for an early ballot to a person who did not request an application.\u201d Perhaps they\u2019re worried about 1A claims, or more cynically, this would allow the GOP to reach those 65+ voters who are certainly eligible. \n\nIn a Trumpian nod to the Big Lie, there is a ton of new language about the illegality of \u201cvote harvesting\u201d. If a party or pac pays you to collect early vote ballots from nursing homes, you\u2019d now be committing a felony, as well as open yourself up to civil liability- meaning the opposing party could sue you for damages. We all know how rampant this was in 2020, with Soros funded Dem agents pressuring or even just filling out old people\u2019s ballots, thank gd for this much needed language \/s. \n\nLastly, all vote-by-mail ballots would be subject to diligent signature verification. The envelope signature needs to match the ballot signature which needs to match your application signature and the driver\u2019s license copy you submitted. Something tells me Johnny Flynn III will have a whole lot easier time than Marshawn Brown getting through this ridiculous verification process. Which is to say, it\u2019s another example of racism and voter suppression. \n\n**4) Protects The Rights and Repeals Restrictions on Poll Watchers\/Observers**\n\nThis isn\u2019t talked about enough. There\u2019s no test or certificate program one needs to do to become a poll watcher. They\u2019re merely appointed by their party. And as we saw in 2020, in the case of Trump\u2019s Observers and Watchers, you couldn\u2019t find a dumber, ruder, more self-entitled group of schmucks if you visited Disneyland on Senior Skip day. \n\nIn the past, election officers had the upper hand when it came to these people. *Reasonable* access was enough, so they couldn\u2019t crowd you while you\u2019re counting and they could dismiss you if you were out of hand. You\u2019d think after the harassment these vote counters were subjected to in 2020, we\u2019d be strengthening laws protecting them. \n\nThis bill would go the other way. It would make it a Class A misdemeanor for an election official refuses full access to a watcher. *Reasonable* would be stricken, and watchers would be guaranteed free movement and stand \u201cnear enough to see and hear the election officials conducting their official activities.\u201d The watcher must be given access to watch the vote tallies be transferred to the data storage device, and then are free to follow the election materials from the regional to the central location or wherever final tabulation occurs. If an election official tries to create distance b\/w the watcher and the vote tabulation, they would possibly be committing another offense. \n\nBut don\u2019t worry, the watcher takes an oath not \u201cto harass\u201d anyone \/s. \n\n**5) Attempts to Limit Checks and Balances**\n\n\u201cA public official may not create, alter, modify, waive, or suspend any election standard, practice, or procedure mandated by law or rule in a manner not expressly authorized by this code.\u201d\n\nGd forbid something like covid happens again\u2026 say, like, a county-wide blackout caused by the failing, aging energy system that Abbott and the Legislature **should** be dealing with rather than this BS\u2026 the GOP doesn\u2019t want Democratic friendly district and county judges imposing voter friendly rules like they did in some places in 2020. \n\n####\n\n**Gov Abbott Dialed up the Pressure By Vetoing Salaries for All Legislature Members and Their Staffs. Beginning SEPTEMBER 1st, No More Paychecks For Anyone\u201d \n\nThis is some  [Bat Shit Crazy](https:\/\/www.texastribune.org\/2021\/06\/18\/greg-abbott-veto-legislature-democrats\/amp\/)[bat shit crazy](https:\/\/www.texastribune.org\/2021\/06\/18\/greg-abbott-veto-legislature-democrats\/amp\/) stuff. Facially, it seems like a pretty evident abuse of power, with the Executive Branch impinging on the rights and duties of the Legislature. But idk Texas law, and should it survive, and should the stalemate continue, the consequences of this are potentially dire.  \n\nThe special legislative session ends August 6, but that date is meaningless, as Abbott has virtually unlimited power to keep calling 30 day special sessions. He\u2019s hinted his intent to do so, leaving Texas Dems effectively homeless. For the most part, they\u2019ve been in DC- agitating for the Federal government to pass the For the People Voting Act, which would block most of what Texas hopes to achieve (Congress would have to end the filibuster to do so, and they don\u2019t have the support to do so =-[ ). The stakes are high, the Texas Dems are being cheered on, Abbott shows no sign of backing down. This thing could drag out for awhile. \n\nWhen we hit 09\/01\/21- house and senate electors will stop being paid their $7,200 yearly salaries, with only GOP and present Dem members receiving their $220 per diem when in session. Some of these guys are independently rich, others have second jobs, which hopefully many of them can do remotely (but they tend to be lawyers so, not sure). \n\nIt\u2019s not really the electors I\u2019m worried about\u2026 it\u2019s the 2,000+ staffers on both side of the aisle. \n\nThe median salary for a House Staffer is $36,000, the lowest paid make just $1,200. Median for the Senate is $44,661, with the lowest paid at $4,160. And these being medians, I imagine young, newer aides make half that. [Source](https:\/\/www.houstonchronicle.com\/politics\/texas\/article\/How-much-do-Texas-legislators-make-A-look-at-16222302.php)\n\nAbbott is literally trying to starve them out. House members will be fine; I\u2019m sure they can obtain a \u201cpersonal loan\u201d from a DNC backer or find a way to treat personal expenditures as politically related. But they care about their staff and the best they\u2019d be able to do for em is lay them off so they can apply for Texas\u2019 crappy unemployment. \n\nThank you to those who have read my post up to this point. I know I wasn\u2019t brief but I hope I laid out the stakes, the courage of these 51 Texas Dems, and a potentially looming pitfall in their strategy. I am not even that strong democrat, but anyone who has read the original or updated bill (and either could still pass, technically) can tell it\u2019s an attack on America. What the GOP\u2019s proposing is downright evil. It\u2019s basically the legislative equivalent of gerrymandering. Both the GOP state and National party recognize the shifting demographics that could turn Texas blue in 4-8 years, and they are committed to ensuring that can\u2019t happen with this restrictive voting bill. It\u2019s a slap in the face to the Democratic Texas party apparatus that has worked so hard over the last decade, and more importantly, it\u2019s a slap in the face to democracy. \n\nHow can you help? I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve never done something like this before, myself. What I hope to do, ideally, is take Abbott\u2019s \u201csalary slasher\u201d chess piece off the table. Prevent his tactic by organizing some sort of a gofundme or something thru actblue that would take up a collection to serve as a backstop for those Texas Democratic house\/senate staff who lose their salaries on September 1st, and could really use the help. \n\nIf you have any experience, or any ideas, or just want to help\u2026 please reach out. And keep spreading the word about Texas. This is democracy\u2019s Alamo."},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1626694300,"title":"The United States, Joined by Allies and Partners, Attributes Malicious Cyber Activity and Irresponsible State Behavior to the People\u2019s Republic of China","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1626700574,"title":"Joe Biden's approval rating is soaring among independents","num_comments":106,"description":""},{"author":"buildzeewallnow","created_utc":1626700899,"title":"Two more Texas Democrats who fled to DC test positive for COVID-19","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626701086,"title":"This is why Abbott wants to restrict voting rights in Texas.","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Repulsive-Ad4986","created_utc":1626701181,"title":"This is why Abbott wants to restrict our voting rights","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626704058,"title":"Why isn't trump in prison yet?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626705423,"title":"I will not accept a pedophile as my President","num_comments":1,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1626707346,"title":"Biden is definitely right about FB misinformation","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"reddog342","created_utc":1626707409,"title":"Wow lets see why people are not getting vaccine","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"edlightenme","created_utc":1626714321,"title":"Meanwhile far left democrats want to ban guns.

It's small and there are only a few staff supporting a few providers.  One of my coworkers is a woman of immense caucasity who we'll call J.  Where we live if you have a Blue Cross insurance policy acquired through the ACA insurance marketplace the group number is 99EE or some variation thereon so you can spot them by looking at their cards.  (Our office doesn't accept Medicaid but that's a whole other problem.)  If a patient comes through with one of these, J will immediately defer their care to me or someone else, refusing to help them.  Then later if they have questions or need something from her she cops an outrageous attitude and is blatantly rude and curt with them.\n\nI have debated this, and other political topics with her, and her feelings are essentially that these patients are \"moochers\" because they got their insurance through \"Obamacare\" and don't pay for it.  I've explained that these policies have premiums just like employer-sponsored policies do but she refuses to believe this.  She then elaborates on how the ACA was a huge mistake because it \"enabled people who don't deserve health insurance.\"  We have a LOT of patients on Medicare and she has no qualms about treating them with respect and prompt service.\n\nAlso when a patient comes in who speaks Spanish and not English, if she hears me speaking Spanish to them (it's a second language for me, learned in school) she will become enraged and freak out, telling me that I cannot even speak to these patients because I am not certified as a medical interpreter (even if all I'm doing is telling the patients to fill out some forms).  I once asked J why we shouldn't be allowed to speak Spanish and she said, \"They could be saying all kinds of stuff right to someone's face, insulting them, whatever, and you'd never know because they speak some other language.  We can't enable that.\"\n\nJ is precious.  Being part of a tribe that is slowly being made to make room for people with differing origins, opinions, cultures, values, and lifestyles must be so traumatic for her.  Constantly in defensive posture against a world that no longer caters only to people like her.  Oh, and she's a Trump sycophant, but that goes without saying.  I'd say it's unbearable to be around her if it weren't so damn funny."},{"author":"PsychPolitics","created_utc":1627069591,"title":"\"THAT'S A LIE!!!\" Senate Meeting GOES OFF THE RAILS in Heated Debate on Biden Nominee Confirmation","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"edlightenme","created_utc":1627070083,"title":"Fucking idiots.","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"bstiglets","created_utc":1627071019,"title":"Meanwhile in Texas\u2026","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1627072686,"title":"Imagine You Are Arrested.

So I have opinions following both sides. \n\nAs the title states, what has Biden done positively for Americans? I\u2019ve seen an abundance of things where he has undone action by the Trump admin or to help folks in need outside of the Americans, but I don\u2019t see many things that are done specifically to benefit the common folks or lesser (maybe families that make 100k and less).  Even though I view a lot of negatives from the Biden admin, I want to see the good in it. \n\nPreferably not topics that are heavily controversial like abortion or covid. This isn\u2019t good for factual arguments as they can easily create a strawman fallacy. And again, exclude topics regarding external countries. For ex: Trump adjusted taxes that benefitted majority of folks in the middle or lesser class. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not denying, I just don\u2019t have the time to catch up on the politics.

The reports had been considered sacrosanct for decades and untouchable by political appointees in the past, but Trump appointees pushed last year to edit the findings, worried that they undermined Trump\u2019s more optimistic spin on the coronavirus pandemic.\nSenior officials also discussed how to respond to a Trump appointee\u2019s demand to edit the reports, according to a newly released email obtained by the House\u2019s select subcommittee on the pandemic.\n\n\nHouse Democrats also released a newly obtained email sent by a career CDC official on Aug. 9, 2020, suggesting that senior officials could meet to discuss \u201cnext steps\u201d after then-Trump appointee Paul Alexander demanded \u201can immediate stop on all CDC MMWR reports.\u201d Alexander, a deputy of then-HHS spokesman Michael Caputo, had alleged that CDC officials were deliberately working to undermine Trump with the reports, which he claimed offered an unnecessarily pessimistic view of the pandemic.\nSchuchat, McGowan, Campbell and Witkofsky were copied on the email about meeting to discuss next steps; the email also was sent to former CDC director Robert Redfield. House Democrats said last year that Redfield ultimately instructed officials to delete Alexander\u2019s email, citing an interview with a CDC official who heard the claim secondhand.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Office of the Director leadership team and a recipient of this email, you appear likely to have firsthand knowledge of this troubling incident, including who may have participated in relevant conversations, whether Director Redfield may have told CDC staff to delete this email, and what steps may have been taken to effectuate such an instruction,\u201d Democrats wrote to Schuchat, McGowan, Campbell and Witkofsky.\nSome of the former officials that House Democrats are hoping to interview told The Washington Post that they had no additional knowledge of how Redfield handled Alexander\u2019s demands, including an alleged phone call between CDC officials on Aug. 9.\n\u201cWe were not involved in any of those discussions,\u201d McGowan said, noting that he and Campbell were already \u201cout of the loop\u201d because they had put in their two-week notice. McGowan and Campbell, who left the CDC on Aug. 14, have publicly criticized the Trump administration for interfering with CDC career officials\u2019 work during the pandemic.\n\nThe subcommittee also released a list of 88 alleged examples of the Trump administration\u2019s interference in public health matters last year, citing media reports and its own investigations. Some of the allegations are drawn from new books about the pandemic response and have not yet been independently verified.\nPolitico first reported on Sept. 11 that Trump appointees had demanded the right to edit the CDC\u2019s reports and won some changes to scientists\u2019 language, prompting Democrats to open an investigation. Caputo took medical leave on Sept. 16, and HHS announced that Alexander would be \u201cpermanently\u201d leaving the agency on the same day.\nTrump officials celebrated efforts to change CDC reports on the coronavirus, emails show\nRedfield and other Trump appointees repeatedly claimed last year that the agency\u2019s reports had been protected from political interference.\n\u201cAt no time has the scientific integrity of the MMWR been compromised. And I can say that under my watch, it will not be compromised,\u201d Redfield testified to the Senate on Sept. 16. However, he told CNN in March that former HHS Secretary Alex Azar and other Trump officials tried to change several MMWRs that they did not like, a charge Azar disputed."},{"author":"flaskman","created_utc":1627399307,"title":"Way under reported piece of news from David Fahrenthold on Twitter","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"zwaaa","created_utc":1627399876,"title":"Indeed","num_comments":77,"description":""},{"author":"grammasharra_r","created_utc":1627400052,"title":"Select Committee on Jan. 6th Hearing","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"flaskman","created_utc":1627402413,"title":"The idea of fake doctor Seb Gorka calling ANYONE a coward let alone the Capitol Police","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"Roberto75229","created_utc":1627405154,"title":"\ud83d\ude31","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"salame_cioccolato_88","created_utc":1627405527,"title":"Top Countries by Total Exports \u2013 1970\/2020","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1627407359,"title":"Obama setting up big bash to celebrate his 60th","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"Slaware","created_utc":1627409737,"title":"GOP Reps Abandon Disastrous Presser on Jan. 6 Hearing","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1627410277,"title":"National Democratic fundraising committees catch up with GOP","num_comments":2,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1627411228,"title":"The Jan 6th Insurrection Was The Centerpiece of a Failed Coup by Donald Trump","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"bugleweed","created_utc":1627412326,"title":"Moral Monday: Taking it to the States at Senate Offices Across the Nation by Poor People\u2019s Campaign","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"freethnkr79","created_utc":1627412459,"title":"Reps.

It is just an out of control cult at this point. Between the racism, sexism, xenophobia, anti-intellectualism, and anti-Democrat obsession, you end up with a completely useless party that stirs up outrage and anger in people and drives them to do very bad things. They are now trying to rewrite the fascist coup attempt of January 6, and get their fascist supporters off the hook for their vile, reprehensible, subhuman, and savage behavior. The Republicans with a moral conscience are considered party and race traitors, and will get ejected sooner or later it feels like. \n\n\nRegarding the actions of some Americans now, I felt like vomiting when the Capitol officer testified on his racial abuse from the domestic terrorists, and this feels like just the millionth iteration of \u201conly white lives matter.\u201d I don\u2019t understand this obsession with racism, or why anyone supports this kind of vile behavior. To be frank, you\u2019re a disgusting human if you are too cowardly to disagree civilly and resort to attacking people on the basis of race. Some other sickening examples from the last year or so that come to mind (no links because I\u2019m on mobile but just look up this stuff): the high schoolers in Traverse City who had mock slave auctions for their Black classmates, the reactions to someone holding a Black Lives Matter sign in Harrison Arkansas, and the general strawmanning of the BLM movement. It is clear to me that millions of Americans would be totally fine with reinstituting Jim Crow and segregation across the nation. (I\u2019m not ignoring the whole \u201cincarceration is the new Jim Crow,\u201d but I\u2019m more talking about the idea of anti-miscegenation laws, separate entrances, etc.) \n\nThe anti-intellectualism sweeping the country is also a disaster right now. A lot of Americans who claim to be patriots have a ton of contempt for education and knowledge, which is bad for national security and the further development of the US. These fools look like clowns when it comes to vaccines and they are needlessly prolonging a taxing blow to our country. The explosive rejection of CRT further indicates a complete revulsion to the idea of academic thought. \n\nI could go on all day listing the systemic, catastrophic faults in the US right now, but I assume y\u2019all already know them. The Democratic Party isn\u2019t able to address all these issues when half of Congress thinks they are all made up, and while I have my gripes about Biden, he legitimately cares about this country. Same goes for Obama and Clinton. Even with people like the Bushes and Reagan, while I disagree a ton with them and believe they caused their fair share of problems, I don\u2019t feel as if any of them riled up the demons of the Right quite like we\u2019ve seen in the last 5-6 years. Democrats have to scrape and claw to avoid further backsliding, which limits their ability to really address the issues at hand. The protests of 2020 barely moved the needle at all - it doesn\u2019t seem like any level of protest will quell racism, and it has only made the racists more staunch. Commentary on race is getting repetitive and useless at this point  - I\u2019ve probably read over a hundred articles in the last year discussing the privilege of not having to think about race, the fact that white people can\u2019t fully understand life as a person of color, and the fact that racism pervades a lot of American culture. I understand the commentary, but I\u2019ve heard it so often and nothing has changed. Nothing works to fix racists.\n\nI just can\u2019t see anything fundamentally getting better without there being a civil war. Call me an alarmist or out of touch or flippant about war, whatever, but I think Trump has damaged this country beyond repair. There\u2019s no solution I can see. Am I overreacting or is the situation as bad as I\u2019ve assessed? It makes me so sad because I know there are millions of good people in this country, but the actions of the millions of bad people are overpowering. This country is falling apart in ways I never expected 10 years ago. I thought we were on the upswing then - maybe I was na\u00efve, but in any case, what\u2019s happening now makes me want to cry.

And while the map wasn't bad, it wasn't perfect either. So, after using Districtr in order to get accurate information and estimates on how big each district should be by population, I made a few changes.\n\n[Ohio's New Congressional Map](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/54ttr1p9zeh71.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa09fa2c4afd349ab7c575a0b5eb1f9cd2cd3b9a)\n\n\\*Note: Ohio's 14th district is the one surrounding the 15th that's not labeled; Ohio's 9th district is the red one above Columbus\n\nEach district has a similar population. And while it doesn't follow Ohio county lines as much as before, it doesn't split 18 counties once, or 5 counties twice, so it follows Ohio's constitution. Not only that, while politics were taken into consideration, they were done so for cultural matters only. Not for gerrymandering purposes. But now here's the question y'all are asking. How many seats do the democrats and republicans control?! Well here they are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ohio's New Congressional Districts By Vote](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/u6ubf4v70fh71.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&s=979f97d2ec647fdbe3e06cf743f7d71b1347eba3)\n\nAs you can see, this is much more representative of the state. I would say there are 4 competitive districts (those less than 10 point difference) which are OH-2, OH-3, OH-7, and OH-9. OH-3 would by far be those most competitive, as both democrats and republicans have a reasonable chance at winning. This is because while there are cities like Lakewood and Elyria that boost democrats, there are more moderate, decent-sized suburbs on the west side of Cleveland that drive up the republicans overall. These numbers are based on 2016 presidential election results, the most accurate data I had. Democrats would win 6 seats compared to the GOP's 9, which makes sense considering the GOP has a slight advantage in Ohio. Overall, I believe this is a much fairer map than the one we have. Oh and just for fun, here is where Ohio's current representatives would be representing:\n\nSteve Chabot - OH-15\n\nBrad Wenstrup - OH-15\n\nJoyce Beatty - OH-11\n\nJim Jordan - OH-12\n\nBob Latta - OH-1\n\nBill Johnson - OH-10\n\nBob Gibbs - OH-8\n\nWarren Davidson - OH-13\n\nMarcy Kaptur - OH-2\n\nMike Turner - OH-13\n\nVacant\n\nTroy Balderson - OH-10\n\nTim Ryan - OH-5\n\nDavid Joyce - OH-5\n\nVacant\n\nAnthony Gonzalez - OH-3"},{"author":"M12NAN","created_utc":1628992057,"title":"Donald Trumps Speech","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Correct_Platypus5649","created_utc":1628993962,"title":"MNGOP Chair\u2019s Best Friend Arrested For Running A Child Sex Ring","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"BCrumpalump","created_utc":1629002737,"title":"Biden's Community College Plan","num_comments":2,"description":"Yo, hoping you guys can answer this question: \nI know Biden is trying to pass 2 years free of community college, does anyone know if that would apply for people who already have degrees but are going back to school?

Now obviously I don\u2019t want him to be recalled, but if it does happen then I at least want a competent Democrat to take his place. Can anyone elaborate on which of the democratic candidates are legitimate and actually have relevant experience? I see that one of the candidates is a college student!

For me, it's because Moscow Mitch will not stop at whatever it takes to get the Supreme Court to his personal liking.  When he said that he will block a Biden nominee if he takes control again in 2022, that was the final straw that caused me to hop on board the \"expand the court\" train.  In addition, Justice Breyer deciding to remain on Scotus next term adds to my concerns since the next Scotus term will end just a month before the 2022 elections.  An unpopular opinion (for Dems at least) is that I think Scotus should only be expanded to 11.  While conservatives would still have the majority, Chief Justice Roberts would, at least, get to be the swing vote again, and he's sided with liberals multiple times.  So with that, why do you believe that Scotus should be expanded?"},{"author":"Jakepieske","created_utc":1629138902,"title":"But we are the good ones","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"freethinker78","created_utc":1629139669,"title":"Rep.

and public officials must make a course change on covid.\n\nThe Biden administration would be well advised to shift from a \u201ccovid is a pandemic\u201d and \u201cvaccines are our way to normal\u201d to a \u201ccovid is here to stay\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s manage covid as best we can\u201d approach with vaccines being one of the tools in the toolkit.\n\nBasis:\n\nThough first highly (and surprisingly) effective against COVID transmission The vaccine is now only mildly effective in preventing transmission of the virus due to variants \n\nIn all likelihood the vaccine will soon prove ineffective in preventing serious illness with newer variants .\n\nWe therefore may need a new or semi new (not just a third) vaccine against new variants which would be a large program to pull off, it would also likely mean that we keep needing new ones.\n\nIn general and especially in light of the above, anti vaccination and vaccine hesitancy is here to stay, therefore making it difficult for the current and future COVID vaccines to solve the problem (think the flu shots and the amount of people that get them, and the difference being here that it\u2019s increasingly looking that it\u2019s not just the elderly and Immunocompromised which are vulnerable to covid but younger and healthy fellows as well especially with the newer variants).\n\nIn light of the above, we have to accept the reality that although the current vaccine has been highly effective in saving lives and has been in some ways a true medical miracle, vaccines by themselves may not be the answer and we must develop additional tools to deal with this pandemic and keep people safe.\n\nSo let\u2019s examine what we have done so far, see if they are viable options and if not let\u2019s examine a possible new approach.\n\nShutdowns:\n\nAs covid hit and we had no tools to stop it (we didn\u2019t even have testing to know if we had it) we pulled the rabbit out of the hat and proposed a novel idea, shut down everything and slow\/stop the transmission of the virus.\n\nWhat\u2019s become clear over time however is that this is not a long term viable solution due to financial, psychological, health, and political reasons.\n\nFinancial - Governments simply can\u2019t prop up the economy forever.\n\nPsychological and health - staying at home has been devastating to people's psychological and emotional health, it\u2019s also been devastating to physical health, delayed appointments, Missed diagnosis and so much more.\n\nPolitical - eventually even the most civic minded Health-conscious and Pro government intervention people will lose patience in sitting home, and will make it be known to their governments (local and federal). we are social and active animals, we simply weren't designed to sit at home all day.\n\nContainment strategies:\n\nWe developed the idea that if one stays apart from one another, and wears a face covering we can slow the spread.\n\nThis however is turning out to not be fully viable due to increasing contagiousness and human weariness.\n\nIncreasing contagiousness - with it becoming clear that the virus can become aerosolized as well the virus becoming more and more contagious, and likely to become even more so with future variants, the likelihood that 6 foot distance will have significant effect is diminishing. The likelihood that masks will significantly reduce the spread will soon become Less apparent.\n\nHuman weariness - we have to remember human nature, human nature is not to wear a mask for an Unquantified amount of time, even if you turn it into a sort of a religion, many may accept it but plenty of people will reject it (as we already see), it\u2019s not about if these people are right or wrong, the fact is that there will be many who reject it, the reality therefore is that this will not be very effective in stopping COVID (look at Florida Texas and many Republican controled states).\n\n(To be clear, I am not advocating against masking, I think to frame the mask issue as a personal freedoms issue as the republicans and governor Ron desantis of Florida has done is missing the point and wrong, what I am doing is observing the facts on the ground, and the fact is that many are rejecting it, and there is not much you can do about it.\n\nI am also not advocating against the vaccine, I am double vaccinated even though I already had the virus, and yes i still encourage people even in the younger age group to get the vaccine for it is currently saving lives, I am however pointing out what it looks like the practical future of vaccines are, again the facts on the ground the way they are.)\n\nI therefore come to the conclusion that COVID is here to stay for the foreseeable future and we would be well served if doctors and public officials start talking and approaching it that way, we therefore must  also open a new focus (besides what we have: masking, and vaccines) in combating this virus: therepudics.\nWe must launch a Manhattan style project to fund, promote and encourage investment in therepudics.\n\nWhat we have so far: \nThe antibody therapy - the antibody therapy has seen promising results when intervening early in the diagnosis, we should invest in developing them to be effective against new variants, plentiful, as well as make them accessible for those that are not highly connected and informed, we must also have a public education campaign about them and encourage people to get access to to it right away. We must make them available to people without medical conditions (obviously with clinical testing beforehand - which is another area for focus and funding.)\n\nThere has been a study out of Israel on a new therapeutic that shortens the stay of those in the hospital and is highly effective against death. this study has not yet completed the most rigorous round of testing, but is nevertheless looking promising, it attacks the part of the immune system which overreacts to covid making it respond normally, a large amount of severe illness is caused by this problem and can be prevented, we should be studying this, funding, promoting it amongst doctors and making it available.\n\nSome Scientists in Israel have a novel approach, instead of focusing on developing new drugs, focus on existing ones that will be easier, quicker and less costly to bring into the field.\n\nIn addition to those mentioned above, There are many other therapeutics which are being studied, we should be focusing on it, promoting it, talking about it, and funding these programs.\n\nMost of all there has to be a public angle to this new program, ppl should be talking about this as they do about vaccines, it should be promoted, it should become common knowledge (which will lead to more people getting them) that even if one gets covid, and is even hospitalized there are ways to get out alive and in good health.\n\n(we should also be investing in addressing long covid which is a significant Phenomena and is not addressed enough in the medical literature and investments).\n\nIn short, we once hoped that a vaccine would quickly and cleanly take us out of the pandemic, it\u2019s now clear that that is no longer the case, (and will become more clear as the time goes on) we must therefore change our approach to reflect the current reality on the ground."},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1629458144,"title":"Verify: Yes, this photo of severely ill COVID patients lying on the ground in Jacksonville waiting for monoclonal therapy is real; The person who took the photo says he's \"never seen people so sick.

Facebook is a given - Trumpers are consumed by it. That\u2019s where they get all their \u201cinfo\u201d. I live in the most liberal state in the country (Massachusetts) and EVERY local news post on Facebook is practically 9 out of 10 Trumpers in the comments. \n\nI\u2019m talking about Instagram. Literally doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s @CNN, @MSNBC, @FOXNEWS (DUH), the @WHITEHOUSE and @POTUS Instagram pages. Even political memes intended to be funny. The \u201ctop comments\u201d are always Trump supporters. And the comments are OVER RUN with them. It\u2019s unsettling because no matter what, you will always be outnumbered if you speak out against Trump and in favor of Biden and you will feel as if you\u2019re in the minority, when in fact, Trump supporters are the minority. A majority of the country LOATHES these people\u2026 but all the blame from Trump\u2019s fuck ups are being shifted to Biden, the OBSESSIVE pedophilia\/senile smear campaigns. The implication and belief that all Biden voters regret not voting for trump. The outright LIES. It\u2019s making me want to leave social media all together. \n\nI was never overly political until this culture war began once Trump took office and Americans were pinned against each other. Democrats and Republicans disagree on fundamental issues. That\u2019s cool. That\u2019s how politics works. But it\u2019s become legitimate fucking hatred.

All started by my other Democrat\/vaccinated sis in law posting a meme about the vaccine. All hell broke loose. First, I was mainly staying out of it, but how they were treating my younger sis in law was just wrong. She called me bawling over her brother calling her (and I) insane for our beliefs. They absolutely will not listen to reason or fact. \"It's just the flu\", \"it has a 99.99% survival rate\", and they also think getting vaccinated will make them sicker than covid could. They just do not care about others and it is INFURIATING!!!! My brother in law told us that we really dont take covid seriously because we have still gone by them (since being fully vaccinated. We stayed away before and they got super butt hurt). Just gas lighted the fuck out of us. Anway, it all got pretty bad and I deleted my FB (was going to anyway since its such a cesspool of misinformation and hate). The last thing I told my sis in law was that I had nothing to say to them anymore. Should be interesting to see what happens later. Thank God my husband is not like his brother! \n\nAlso, I used to be a Republican, but became Democrat in December. I remeber when this same brother in law found out. I will never forget the look on his face. He seriously looked at me like I was the scum of the Earth. \n\nSorry for rambling.

And if so, what would be the best strategy?","num_comments":9,"description":"Making a concerted effort to turn Texas Democratic next year seems like the best possible response to the recent news from the state. Although it\u2019s certain to be an uphill battle, so was Georgia in 2020, and yet the Peach State elected Biden and two Democratic senators.\n\nSince there is no U.S. Senate election next year in Texas, the primary target will of course be incumbent governor Greg Abbott. His handling of the pandemic has been atrocious, so anyone who has been personally impacted by COVID will have extra reason to want him gone.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the abortion bill he signed, which may lead to boycotts of Texas (a fact that business-oriented voters, even those who typically lean Republican, are likely to be nervous about). From personal experience and on social media, I also know that there are a _lot_ of (usually female) voters who normally vote Republican (either due to being anti-\u201cwoke\u201d or because they lean libertarian on economics) but who are pro-choice. If they can be convinced to at least stay home, Abbott would lose a significant fraction of his support. If Allen West primaries Abbott and somehow wins, it might make things easier because of how extreme West is.\n\nFurthermore, a Democratic victory for governor would have down-ballot benefits, and several U.S. House seats could probably be flipped as well. Flipping one or both houses of the state legislature might be more difficult (due to gerrymandering) but wouldn\u2019t be entirely impossible.\n\nEven just electing a Democratic governor would be a major win, because they could issue an executive order to suspend (or at least curtail the enforcement of) the abortion bill, until it can be repealed or struck down by other means. If the pandemic hasn\u2019t ended by then, they could also undo Abbott\u2019s disastrous COVID orders as well.\n\nWe\u2019d need a multi-pronged strategy, which would have to involve:\n\n1. Registration and GOTV efforts aimed at underrepresented Democratic-leaning constituencies (like the New Georgia Project but on a larger scale)\n\n2. Persuading disaffected Republican-leaners (as mentioned above) to at the very least stay home, and\n\n3. Increasing turnout among established Democrats who sometimes (but don\u2019t always) vote\u2014make sure they know what is at stake in 2022 and not to stay home even though it\u2019s an \u201coff year\u201d.\n\nAny other suggestions for how\/if such an effort could succeed?"},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1630626725,"title":"Self-Styled \u2018Shaman\u2019 Ditches the \u2018QAnon\u2019 Moniker and Will Plead Guilty in Capitol Siege Case \u2014 Months After Saying Trump Duped Him","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1630627077,"title":"No offense but I dated a trans and they were annoying as shit.

It must be because all Democrats are lazy\/corporate\/senile.\" It's an unholy mixture of complete ignorance of how our political system actually works and blindness to passed policies actively helping underprivileged groups.\n\nSo much has been accomplished just in the past 8 months. People seem to have memory loss where they forget major victories moments after it happens. We've literally already seen one of the largest welfare expansions in the American Rescue Plan Act. 3 million children were kept out of poverty. Poverty in general decreased by 45%. The ACA saw some of the highest enrollment numbers and decreasing costs in years. These are just a few of the major accomplishments not even mentioning executive actions. If these don't matter to you, then you only care about virtue signaling and not actually helping underprivileged people.\n\nFor upcoming goals, people seem to have not a shred of knowledge about how things work. Democrats have control of both houses of Congress and the Presidency, but this does not mean that suddenly Joe Biden wields an Infinity Gauntlet and can make anything happen with a snap of his fingers. How much power you have is proportional to how big your majorities are. With razor thin margins in both houses, legislation can literally be tanked if someone gets sick. Historically these kinds of Congresses can only get a little done. If you ever ask \"Why can't Democrats do this?\", the answer is not \"Biden bad,\" or \"Schumer bad,\" or even \"Manchin bad.\" The answer is that there are not enough Democrats in Congress plain and simple. The fact that Senators from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are being less cooperative than Senators from Montana and West Virginia is a far bigger issue."},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1630697243,"title":"Biden signs order to declassify 9\/11 attack investigation documents","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"semaphore-1842","created_utc":1630697492,"title":"Senate Democrats announce probe of Supreme Court's Texas abortion ruling, 'abuse of the shadow docket.'","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Murky_Try_7971","created_utc":1630698958,"title":"Please help...","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1630699231,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"imll99","created_utc":1630700471,"title":"President Biden Reconvenes U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1630701700,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1630703919,"title":"The Time for Democrats to Go Nuclear Was Yesterday","num_comments":38,"description":""},{"author":"Whistles_in_the_Dark","created_utc":1630705190,"title":"Texas Republicans Got What They Wanted.

I tend to be someone who rides the fence and decides which candidates most align with my beliefs. It's unfortunate that about 75% of my beliefs lie within the parameters of the democratic party but that's just how it goes. \n\nThat being said...\n\nDo not let Republicans control the narrative for the future of cryptocurrencies. Right now we have people like Warren spreading doomsday type garbage about how cryptocurrencies will cause the collapse of the US financial system. And honestly, that may be true. But consider WHY it's causing such a ruckus amongst politicians and big wallstreet people. I'm not going to go with a long winded debate into the why, but I want this out there because I see where it's headed. If you let Republicans control this narrative, the tide of influence of those who sit on the fence will GREATLY widen, specifically those centrists who are very pro crypto.\n\nPeople who believe in crypto very adamantly believe in it for a ton of good and bad reasons, but ultimately they are VERY willing to go to war (metaphorically speaking) for it. If you alienate them, not only are you alienating some of your own political base, but also the people you want to lean left instead of right. \n\nWhat I am saying is, write to your representatives letting them know your thoughts about cryptocurrencies. Do not let them attempt a prohibition of sorts regarding this new financial system that will reshape the way we think finance. \n\nMoney has evolved throughout history...\n\nFirst we had the barter system, then minted gold and silver coins,then paper bank notes, then fiat (uncoupled from gold value) and now we have crypto. Each time we changed the way we thought of a new way to trade for goods and services it has led to an economic boom and revolution. \n\nDon't attempt to block the path for the sake of preserving something that has a depreciating value, or for what we know. \n\nWhat we know is safe, what we don't know Innovation.

Taking away our autonomy takes away more than just one choice. To read more about our goals, or to learn how to volunteer to lead a strike in your area, you can visit us on FB, Reddit, Twitter, or Insta under Without Us Strike.\n\nSeptember 25th was the first day a woman was ever appointed to SCOTUS. In light of the most recent attack on human rights in Texas, it feels like SCOTUS has abandoned us by refusing to halt SB 8. They need to be reminded that this country cannot and will not run without us.\n\nOn September 24th and 25th we need to fight back. Help spread the word, volunteer to organize in your city (with guidance and a team), and hit them where it really hurts: Their wallets.\n\nShare on every platform, tell your friends, set your calendars.\n\nThe three goals of this protest are:\n\n1. Pressure SCOTUS to halt the SB 8 bill until after their Spring 2022 ruling on heartbeat bills.\n2. Bring attention to the issue, raise funds for pro choice groups and abortion funds.\n3. Push congress to act in the case that SCOTUS does not. Push them to protect our constitution, to protect our right to autonomy, and to pass legislation to further cement and strengthen abortion access at the Federal level.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\n\n**CALL OUT:** Sick or take time off if you are able to. Ask your partners, friends, and coworkers to call out as well in support of you. If possible, consider walking out instead.\n\n**WALK OUT:** Students Middle School to College can choose to walk out together. Parents, consider calling your children out of class for the whole day. Teens, consider organizing a walk out with your classmates whether you are in person or even virtual.\n\n**GATHER:** If safe, consider joining a march on either day in your area. No march set up in your area? This may be your call to action! We can help hold your hand and guide you through every part of the process, including forming a strong team for you to work with. No one goes alone, and you are every bit smart enough and strong enough to lead. All you have to do is stand up, and raise your hand.\n\n**ABSTAIN:** From all spending. Vote with your dollars by withholding them! Unfortunately, our government officials understand cash above all else, so use that against them. No gas, no groceries, no eating out, no shopping, no unnecessary spending at all.\n\n**REFUSE**: All labor, paid or unpaid, in the home or out of it. If it is applicable to your life and relationships, no cooking, no cleaning, no emotional labor at all. If applicable, leave childcare to your partner(s) for the day.\n\n**POST:** Take to social media, using the red lightning bolt symbol available on our platforms. Videos, songs, poems, your own stories and \"whys\". Make your loved ones see you and put a face to the movement. Flood the internet with support, in a nationwide \"Lightning Strike\".\n\n**DONATE:** To one of the Texas abortion funds. We will have the links available on our platforms both days, and the days leading up to them. Even if you can't donate, you can share. You can aid in fundraising.\n\n*-Please use our logo and flyers that will be available on all our social media pages. Shout it from the roof tops. Call friends and family directly, text them, ask them to support you by joining and sharing.*\n\n*-Please include all pro-choice individuals to help us make this impact. Reproductive healthcare is not an issue for cis women alone, it affects all of us. And the current laws create an awful precedent for violation of other liberties across the board, as well.*\n\nWe're [u\/WithoutUsStrike](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/WithoutUsStrike\/) on IG and Twitter.

They tried over 100 times to repeal Obama Care, and they've done all sorts of other things trying to sabotage it as well.   \nI'd hate to see what kind of dirty tricks they would try to pull to undermine a universal public healthcare system that is operated by the federal government. \n\nSo, instead of trying to get universal healthcare on the federal level, why not try and get it on the state level first? Look at Marijuana, there was no way D.C. Republicans would legalize Marijuana for the whole country. However, when the choice was given over to individual states, Marijuana legalization slowly grew and become more accepted. With multiple states having legalized Marijuana, Republicans are now pressured into legalizing Marijuana if they want to get re-elected. \n\nThe same process could be done with universal public healthcare. Let each state decide if they want a universal public healthcare system or not, and watch the support slowly grow. \n\nAlso, an advantage to individual state-run healthcare is that they would involve less bureaucracy and red-tape. This is because state-run healthcare would obviously be smaller than federal-run healthcare, thus making it more efficient."},{"author":"MulkHulk","created_utc":1631228872,"title":"Great flag!","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"diabolicfam","created_utc":1631229844,"title":"Texas violates the constitutional rights of women by bann their right to choose.

The Democrats in the red states all came out and talked about how the ACA was a failure because it was far too progressive, and needed to be reigned in; the Democrats in the blue states came out and talked about how the ACA was a failure because it was far too conservative, and needed to be expanded.  I'm pretty sure President Obama was the only person willing to admit that the ACA was a pretty good bill, at least in the 2010 election cycle.  \n  \nThe results of the 2010 election were, well, not *great* for the Democrats, to say the least.  Republicans won the biggest electoral victory their party had ever seen, they took over the House of Representatives in the brightest red wave to date, they called it the \"Tea Party Revolution,\" and that Congress would sit in session, blocking any sort of Democratic or progressive legislation from even being voted on, for *eight years.*  (I want you to think of eight years in the context of climate change, just to put into perspective how much damage could be done by just losing control of *one* branch of Government.)   \n  \nNow there are a lot of reasons that the Tea Party happened.  They were funded by the Kochs and the Mercers, they had the benefit of a nationwide propaganda network, many (most?) of them were fueled by racism toward our first Black President, whole books could be written about the rise of the Tea Party.  There was a lot that the Tea Party did \"right,\" insofar as the electoral results are concerned, but the Democratic party did at least one thing wrong: We threw our own policies, party, and President under the bus in front of the whole American electorate.  \n  \nI think this is a good time to remind you of what the Affordable Care Act *did* accomplish, because sometimes we forget.  The ACA reduced the uninsured rate in the United States by half, from 20% to 10%, by giving twenty *million* uninsured Americans health insurance, it eliminated pre-existing conditions like hangnails and pregnancies, it outlawed cost disparities based on race or gender, the ACA let kids stay on their parent's health care until they were 26, it established a short lived mandate that all health insurance plans cover contraceptive care like the birth control pill, it dramatically increased funding to Medicaid, it gave Medicare years more solvency, and in the decade since it passed it's saved taxpayers trillions of dollars, among other things.  ([I'd also like to remind everyone that Nancy Pelosi passed the *full fat* Affordable Care Act in the House of Representatives, complete with a universal public option that would have guaranteed universal health care coverage in the United States,](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2009\/11\/house-passes-historic-health-bill-029282) *and* that many Republican governors outright rejected the expanded Medicaid funding, so the progress that we *did* achieve was great, but it could have been even greater, were it not for Republicans.)  \n  \nHow does one put a price tag on the tens, if not hundreds of thousands of American lives that have been saved or improved by the ACA?  The amount of real-world good accomplished by the Affordable Care Act is incalculable.  Yet it's common to see people all across reddit shit talking the ACA like it made things worse somehow, like a pinch of progress is worse than no progress at all, or that giving health insurance to twenty million uninsured Americans is a bad thing, because it wasn't forty million.  (Yes, I've actually had people tell me that it would have been more fair, more right, more just, and therefore *better* to have insured *nobody,* instead of only giving it to half the people who needed it, that passing 0% of the ACA would have been preferable to passing the 70% that we got, that a half measure is worse than no measure at all.)    \n  \nLet's set aside, just for the moment, the substantive discussion about whether giving health insurance to 20,000,000 uninsured Americans, saving the American taxpayers trillions of dollars, and eliminating pre-existing conditions is a good thing or not, whether or not the ACA *really does suck* as much as everyone says it does.  Instead of that, let's talk about how the only way to make progress politically is to pass legislation, and how the only way to pass legislation is to ***win elections.***  \n\nDo you know what swing voters think when they hear conservatives, moderates, *and* progressives *all* shit talking the ACA, their own party, and their own President?  They think that the ACA is a shit policy, and that *the party that passed it is kind of shit too.*  Shit talking your own legislative victories *makes it harder to achieve more legislative victories.*  \n  \nShit talking the $15\/hr minimum wage makes it harder, not easier, to someday pass a $26\/hr minimum wage.  \n  \nShit talking the most expansive Wall Street reform legislation in half a century does not help the party that passed those regulations to pass *more* regulations.  \n  \nShit talking the public option does not make it easier to pass Medicare for All, and I'd like you to look at it like this: OG Medicare, the LBJ version, didn't achieve universal coverage, not by a mile, and neither did Medicaid, by all the criteria of a reddit user Medicare and Medicaid were half measures, failures, things we should distance from ourselves, our movement, and our party... except if you're like me, Medicare is about as close to sacred as a public policy can be, nobody ever calls OG Medicare a half measure, even though, technically, it is.  Meanwhile nobody would ever thinks twice about calling the Democratic party's greatest achievement in nearly half a century, the Affordable Care Act, a piece of shit half measure that nobody should be proud of, let alone defend, advocate, or *celebrate!*  \n  \nDemocrats had enough votes to pass the public option in the House, and so we did.  Democrats had 55 votes in favor of the public option in the Senate, had Mitch McConnell not filibustered the bill, had Republicans not doubled down on obstruction, we would have universal health care today.  Shit talking the ACA, and the party and people that passed it, doesn't help anyone win elections.  If Democrats go out and tell the voters \"Hey, don't blame us, we think the ACA is a piece of crap too!\" what do you think the voters are going to do?  Well if the 2010 midterm is any indication, they'll believe them, and they'll vote against them.  \n  \nPresident Biden is going to do a lot of things you won't like, that is going to be true for literally every President you'll ever see elected.  You are the only person that you will ever agree with 100% of the time.  You will be asked, often, to choose between your desire to hold your elected officials accountable and your desire to accomplish your goals.  \n\n\"Holding Nancy Pelosi accountable\" by denouncing her climate plan doesn't help the goal of staving off climate change.  \n  \n\"Holding Bernie Sanders accountable\" by denouncing his $15\/hr minimum wage proposal doesn't help the goal of passing a living wage.\n  \n\"Holding the Democratic party responsible\" by undermining the regulations passed in Dodd Frank doesn't help the goal of reigning in Wall Street.  \n\nAnd why don't these things help?  \n\nBecause it doesn't help us win elections, and if we don't win elections we can't pass legislation, and if we can't pass legislation we can't solve problems, and if we can't solve problems we can't make progress.  \n  \nI'm sorry, that sucks, I know that sucks.  If this was 1965, and LBJ still hadn't passed civil rights, still hadn't divided the parties down social lines, you would still have two parties to vote for.  Even going back as recently as George H.W. Bush the Republicans were still at least casually acquainted with objective reality and the concept of bipartisanship.  But right now, today, if we want to achieve our goals there's really only party willing to even try, and and that's the Democratic party. \n Speaking ill of the Democratic and their\/our achievements doesn't help us to achieve our goals, because it helps Republicans win elections.  \n\nIf I may offer a bit of advice, now that you've read this far, it would be this: Cheerlead progress at every opportunity.  \n\nWhen Nancy Pelosi passes a $15\/hr minimum wage bill in the House we should applaud her, not rush to point out the problems.  \n\nWhen Democrats give health insurance to 20,000,000 uninsured Americans we should be doing victory laps, not hiding our heads.  \n  \nWhen Chuck Schumer speaks out passionately about how he wants $50,000 in federal student loan forgiveness for all Americans, we should be bragging about how much our party loves our country, not complaining about how this completely fails to help people with $50,001 in outstanding loans because they'll still be in debt.  \n  \nBe cheerleaders for progress, for movement in the right direction.  Politics is a product, and we should be the advertising and marketing department, because making progress is the most important thing, and we can't do that if we don't win elections.    \n\nI often see people on reddit complain about half measures, but things are only half measures if we let them remain that way, and I'm more hopeful than that, I see these as first steps.  Medicare and Medicaid didn't achieve universal health care coverage, but they were good first steps; giving health insurance to another twenty million Americans with the passage of the ACA was another good step in the right direction; now it's time to keep moving forward, but complaining about the progress we've made, complaining about the progress we're making, won't help us to make more.  \n  \nBe a cheer leader for progress, not for progressives.  \n\n-----  \n  \nOne rebuttal I often see to this, aside from the \"holding them accountable\" one (How, by trying to get them to lose their election?) is that these are \"negotiating tactics,\" to which I would respond with a question: Who do you think you're negotiating with?  It's not Mitch McConnell, because he's going to vote against any minimum wage legislation that doesn't cut it till it's cruel, and it's not Manchin and Sinema, both of whom have far too much power to be bluffed into changing their position.  But it's worse than that, because right now a $26\/hr minimum wage just isn't passable, so it's not a threat, and threatening somebody with something you can't possibly achieve, a threat you can't possibly enforce, isn't a good negotiating tactic.  (Also worth noting, saying out loud and in public \"It's just a negotiation tactic!\" *also* isn't a good negotiation tactic, that's kind of double dipping on bad ideas right there.)"},{"author":"Consistent_Leave_449","created_utc":1631452548,"title":"This morning at the 9\/11 Commemoration Ceremony in Lower Manhattan","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"emeyer4444","created_utc":1631453449,"title":"California Recall: they really should change the state constitution","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1631453626,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1631454307,"title":"Where was trump?

(God help me, but if Louie Gohmert has an idea that can *actually* help us stop global warming, let's hear him out.)  Thing is that the vast majority of right-wing media is fantasy, drug riddled immigrants reelecting Nancy Pelosi with the power of Satan, that kind of crap, stuff that cannot possibly help us solve real world problems because the problems they're talking about aren't actually real.  \n  \nFinancial papers are a *little bit* better, because they're not based on imaginary stuff.

It\u2019s more important than ever to make sure a person\u2019s right to abortion is protected on the federal level.\n\nAbortion bans are state-sanctioned violence. They\u2019re about controlling people\u2019s bodies and lives, especially people of color and low-income folks.\n\n**CALL TO ACTION:**\n\nThe Senate needs to ACT NOW. We can\u2019t allow Roe v.

It was a *white American experience*.   Brown families were often paid cash under the table and lived at the poverty level. And if they could afford to own their own home, the white loan officer at the bank might not give them a mortgage.\n\nAnd that was white men supporting a family in the 1950s.

WHY!?\n\nSay what you will about conservatives, but if the tables were flipped and it was the dems doing this the Republicans would make it a hot button issue and would hammer it home to their voter base that they are clearly rigging the system, but the dems just seem to let it happen right under their nose.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\n\nSources:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/voices\/republicans-rig-elections-democrats-hr1-b1803592.html\n\nhttps:\/\/www.latimes.com\/opinion\/story\/2021-02-28\/republicans-rigging-elections\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2021\/jul\/27\/gerrymandering-republicans-electoral-maps-political-heist\n\nhttps:\/\/newrepublic.com\/article\/160951\/republican-plot-rig-2024-election"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633403943,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633404099,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":27,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"SofaKingOnPoint","created_utc":1633412664,"title":"\u201cPro Life\u201d is just another fascist tool to control people.","num_comments":65,"description":""},{"author":"Paneraiguy1","created_utc":1633438874,"title":"Trump Super PAC rebrands: 'Make America Great Again, Again!'","num_comments":50,"description":""},{"author":"ZiggyZagster","created_utc":1633447303,"title":"Found this funny meme and wanted to share it here \ud83d\ude02","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Paneraiguy1","created_utc":1633448960,"title":"Biden is appointing judges faster than Trump, and most everyone else\u2014for now","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"FreeMathematician533","created_utc":1633453641,"title":"Democrats attempt the near-impossible: Shaming Mitch McConnell","num_comments":21,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633455335,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":3,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Powerful-Dog363","created_utc":1633455483,"title":"What if her only agenda is to get rich off corrupt inside bribes and hidden donations ?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1633457674,"title":"Democrats\u2019 Last, Best Hope to Keep Control of Congress May Be\u2026Conor Lamb","num_comments":6,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633459315,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"RiseCascadia","created_utc":1633460278,"title":"Why Derecka Purnell went from police reformist to abolitionist: \u2018It\u2019s so we can get more free\u2019","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Bethan_B","created_utc":1633465838,"title":"I can't believe Ohio BMV allowed this plate.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633471309,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"cgay123005","created_utc":1633472144,"title":"Steve Bannon pledges 20k \u2018shock troops\u2019 as he rants that \u2018we control this country\u2019","num_comments":113,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633473285,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"PorkyTheChop","created_utc":1633474063,"title":"The Power of Mask Mandates in Schools \u2014 A Student\u2019s Perspective","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633482636,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":3,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"imll99","created_utc":1633482647,"title":"#TBT: President Barack Obama Signs Rosa's Law","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"mustang6172","created_utc":1633485246,"title":"Biden: 'Real possibility' Democrats might change Senate rules for debt hike","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1633485612,"title":"Jen Psaki knocks down Fox reporter\u2019s asinine word game: \u201cLet\u2019s not dumb this down\u201d","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633486833,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":2,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1633486894,"title":"Castro believes O'Rourke has a shot to beat Greg Abbott","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"taintmoun","created_utc":1633487219,"title":"A proposal to use Filibuster only to put Republicans on tough spots before election","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"burningsFinktur","created_utc":1633487863,"title":"so how goes the economy?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633489575,"title":"Would it be possible to unseat Utah Sen.

Together, the two of them received nearly half of the vote, several percentage points _more_ than Trump did. At the time, McMullin wasn\u2019t seriously trying to become president (his was more of a protest candidacy), but now things look different.\n\nIf the Utah electorate hasn\u2019t changed significantly since then, this implies it might be possible to unseat Lee _if_ McMullin\u2019s supporters and the Democrats agree to throw their support behind a single candidate (i.e. whoever is ahead in the polls before voting starts). That\u2019s a big _if_ (McMullin and whomever the Democrats nominate would have to be close enough politically for one to consider endorsing the other at all). But it\u2019s still a scenario worth considering, seeing as how every Senate seat matters in what is likely to be a close battle for control. \u201cOff the beaten path\u201d states like Utah could well end up playing a decisive role."},{"author":"Paneraiguy1","created_utc":1633492678,"title":"Third Sandy Hook parent wins defamation suit against Alex Jones","num_comments":14,"description":""},{"author":"SofaKingOnPoint","created_utc":1633498213,"title":"Drink the Tea.","num_comments":91,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633500401,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"ernestoraulperez","created_utc":1633510150,"title":"Democratic Voters Drive Decline in Sinema\u2019s Popularity in Arizona","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1633517850,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"littleoldlady71","created_utc":1633525350,"title":"This Is Not a Game","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"EagleFly_5","created_utc":1633526299,"title":"Biden and Harris endorse Gov.

If owning the libs is your goal, there are better ways to do it.","num_comments":32,"description":"I call myself a bleeding heart liberal because I care about people, and seeing people letting themselves die to own the libs is *not* my idea of a good time.  Now if you're a conservative you may think that's the ultimate own:  \n\n>\"They want to give me universal health care, so the best way to own them is by letting myself catch a deadly disease!\"\n  \nBut here's the thing: While that is, admittedly, a very **BIG** own, it's also short sighted.  You're focusing on a short term windfall at the expense of long term potential.   Why own us just once by *dying,* when by *surviving* you can own us *many times* for *decades* to come?  \n  \nGetting inoculated against COVID and taking sensible steps to minimize exposure will give you many, many more opportunities to own me than dying does, and with that in mind I've compiled a small list of ways you won't be able to own me if you're dead.  This list is not all inclusive, there are a number of ways that I've left off simply for fear of getting carried away, but it's a reasonable place to start.  \n\n---  \n---  \n  \nIf you're dead there will be nobody to burn their Nikes when an athlete kneels, or destroy their Keurigs when they stop buying ads during Hannity.  \n\nIf you're dead you can't elect people to require women have an invasive transvaginal ultrasound in order to get family planning services.  \n\nIf you're dead there will be nobody to defend the second amendment against common sense research, reforms, and regulations.  \n\nThe delta variant proves evolution is real, by getting vaccinated you can pretend that the delta variant is fake.  \n\nIf you're dead there will be nobody to stop the libs outlawing Christianity, heterosexuality, and\/or Whiteness.  \n  \nIf you're dead you can't scream at members of the school board for teaching critical race theory.  \n\nIf you're dead \"real America\" gets weaker while us cosmopolitan globalist liberals get stronger.    \n\nIf you die before Hillary Clinton does you officially get counted as one of her murder victims.  \n  \nIf you're dead you'll never get to see President Obama's long form Kenyan birth certificate.  \n  \nIf you're dead you can't protest at abortion clinics and the funerals of dead soldiers.  \n\nOsama Bin Laden wanted you to die.  You're not Osama Bin Laden, are you?  \n\nWithout you the oil and coal industries are doomed to failure.  \n\nIf you die nobody will remember American history anymore.    \n\nIf you're dead you lose the war on Christmas.  \n  \nDying to a preventable disease is socialism.  \n\nIf you die the bisexual agenda wins.  \n  \nIf you die you ***can't own the libs.***\n  \n---  \n---  \n\nIf you, dear conservative, really want to get under my skin, I've got news for you: You can't do it from the grave.  The very best way to own the libs is by surviving, in fact it's the *only* way to own the libs, at least the only way to own us more than once.  \n  \n---  \n  \n\/s, okay?  This was all meant to be tongue in cheek, but only a little bit; if I thought these arguments, or arguments like them, could get our countrymen into their doctor's office, I'd be screaming those arguments from the rooftops, but I fear that my encouragement would only inspire them to double down on denialism.  \n  \nIt just sucks, you know?  I'm a liberal because I give a shit about people, even the assholes, so seeing people almost literally killing themselves just so that they can make a political statement hurts.  The fact that the statement they're making is based on propaganda and lies only makes it worse.  \n  \nI had to block HCA, I couldn't handle it, it was too much for me.

He finds something about gas prices and starts going off about Biden and OPEC, and how our country is doomed and China will own us in three years...\n\nMy dad asked me, \"tell me one good thing Biden has done.\"\n\nSo I said \"Sure, as soon as you can tell me one good thing Trump did.\"\n\nHe rattled off all the talking points like closing the border, leaving the World Health Organization, lowering gas prices and unemployment, a strong economy... \n\nI pointed out that Trump inherited low unemployment and a strengthening economy from Obama... He said it was bullshit, so I asked my dad to tell me what specific policies led to all of Trump's successes.\n\nAnd he angrily yelled \"I don't give a fuck about Trump! I'm asking you to tell me what Biden has done and you can't do it!\" Like... Spittle was coming from his mouth.\n\nI didn't answer immediately because I was shocked at how angry and aggressive the conversation had gotten in an instant.\n\nFor the past four plus years, any time Trump was criticized for something, my dad would immediately blame Obama... He would talk about how Obama messed the country up and how Trump is fixing it...\n\nBut now I'm not allowed ask about Trump?\n\nSuddenly comparisons and contrasts aren't allowed in conversations?\n\nThen he told me I'm fucked in the head, and I fired back that he's \"sexist, racist and homophobic, but I'M the one fucked in the head? Yeah, ok.\"\n\nThat was pretty much the end of the conversation.\n\nReally put a damper on the football game we were watching together...\n\nI love my dad very much, but any time politics comes up he turns into an unrecognizable person. Since an injury made him retire from work, all he does is sit in front of the TV and watch the \"news,\" and I hate what it's done to him.\n\nNot really any greater point to this post. I guess I'm just sad at what's happened to my parents."},{"author":"jeeper75","created_utc":1635133580,"title":"Rudy Guliani Reveals his Sources for the Big Lie Under Oath","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635134387,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":18,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"SofaKingOnPoint","created_utc":1635143871,"title":"Great Quotes Throughout Presidential History -","num_comments":53,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635144309,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"fjernigan23","created_utc":1635158584,"title":"No posts about Fauci?","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"KrystalPistol","created_utc":1635158962,"title":"Trouble piles up for Postmaster General Louis DeJoy","num_comments":52,"description":""},{"author":"StormyDankiels","created_utc":1635168250,"title":"There are many ways to be supportive","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"StormyDankiels","created_utc":1635169391,"title":"This is how it has to be","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635171611,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635171665,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635171737,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635172409,"title":"Bidens appearance with Brandon","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"WCBY","created_utc":1635175105,"title":"We need to push for unions.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"smilesandlaughter","created_utc":1635176028,"title":"The Relationship between scientists and political affiliation.

I cannot believe how insane this is really. Of course the figures may have changed over the years but the likelihood of it showing a nicer light on the Republican mind set in this day and age is unlikely IMO.\n\nI do wonder what a sensible Republican may make of this. \n\nI am certain a none sensible Republican would likely use this as evidence of the BIG CONSPIRACIES somehow but at least I found this very interesting.

In Nazi Germany, some things that happened were a)Forcibly relocating Jews to ghettos b)Forcibly transporting Jews to death camps with horrific living conditions c)Murdering Jews with toxic gas, d)Murdering people with disabilities with toxic gas, e)Committing widespread human experimentation, and many more, but what I've listed is enough. But comparing this to anything Biden has done? Shut up and stop minimizing a horrific human tragedy because you wish Trump won.\n\nHere are some relevant questions: Is Biden deploying the Federal Marshals to round up all Trump supporters? Is he nationalizing the economy and seizing private property? Is he calling for a genocide against White people? Is he calling for physical violence against Republicans (remember, Republicans wanted to hang a sitting vice president)? Is he forcing Critical Race Theory that teaches \"White people are demonic\"  to be taught in all schools? Unless I've missed something, the answer to all of the above is no.\n\nIs it completely impossible for Republican voters to think critically about anything? Come on now, use your brain and stop acting like a 5 year old with the constant anger. If you don't like it, leave. Eastern Europe has tons of far right groups for you to join.

Before we get into hysterics, let's take a look at what's actually in this bill.\n\n#Childcare\n\n##Universal and free preschool for all 3 and 4 year olds.\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\n##Expanded Child Tax credit ($3600 total, $300 per month) to 39 million households. \n\nDon't let this one slide as many of the detractor's of Biden's admin have repeatedly acknowledged the good it does, but paired it with the phrase \"but it won't last until the end of the year, so it doesn't matter!\" showing their extreme privilege.\n\n#Climate\n\n##Rebates and tax credits for families switching to clean energy. \n\nThis one lowers the installation cost of Solar by 30%, reducing the payback time by 5 years, and offers a 12,500 credit on EVs made in the US. Don't keep pushing this \"Manchin is doing nothing for the environment\", he may be from Coal Capital US, but he's helping get the right thing gets done whether people see it or not.\n\n##Helps create new jobs in producing Wind and Solar power.\n\nA simple investment plan here, but helps reduce the cost of these two more by evading tariffs and import costs.\n\n##A new climate board (300,000+ members), and a focus on public transportation.\n\nCleaner trucks and buses = cleaner cities = a cleaner world.\n\n##Agriculture restoration.\n\nHelps farmers to restore coasts, forests, and soil ravaged by Climate Change. This means better food and more carbon heat-sinks.\n\n#Healthcare pls\n\n##Gladly! The ACA is now stronger, and premiums have been reduced!\n\nPremiums reduced by $600 per person, per year for 9 million Americans. Roughly 3 million uninsured Americans will now have affordable access\n\n##Medicaid gap, begone!\n\n$0 premiums are now available for up to 4 million uninsured Americans.\n\n##Medicare now covers hearing\n\nI shouldn't have to repeat it, but if I do, and you're 65 and older, congrats! Go get those hearing aides, you earned 'em!\n\n#Buff the Middle Class\n\n##Housing? Yes In My BackYard!\n\nConstruction, rehab, and improvement to 1 million affordable homes. This outta help everyone out.\n\n##More tax credits!\n\nExtends the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for roughly 17million low-wage workers by more than$1,100. This will help pull people out of poverty even if the make above minimum wage.\n\n#Education\n\n##Post High-school education\n\nPell Grants are now increased by $550 for more than 5 million students and also include DREAMers. It also invests in historically black colleges\/universities, and tribal colleges\/universities. Finally, annual spending for the Labor Department's workforce development will increase by 50% for the next 5 years.\n\n##School Meals\n\nFree school meals expanded to 8.7 million children and a monthly payment of $65 per child per month to families of 29 million children to help provide food when school is not in session.\n\n##Immigration\n\nA separate $100 billion in immigration reform alone is included. This will help clean the backlog, expand the legal representation, and make it easier for those seeking asylum.\n\n#But how's it paid for?\n\n##Minimum corporate tax\n\nNow every single corporation that reports $1 billion in profits to it's shareholders must pay a minimum 15% tax on those profits (150,000,000 for 1 $1 billion corporation). Additionally a 1% buyback on corporate stocks is attached.\n\n##Fleeing American taxes? Not so fast!\n\nBiden has made a deal with 136 other countries to impose a global 15% minimum tax. Countries that fail to abide receive a penalty.\n\n##Pay up!\n\nAn additional 5% rate to those with income above 10 million, and 3% more to those making 25 million. Watch out Bernie, millionaires are included in this one.\n\n##A hint towards a newer, more powerful IRS\n\nNot included, but Biden plans to revitalize the IRS to make them the stuff of nightmares for those who evade their taxes.

We will be calling confirmed CalCare supporters who haven't signed the supporter petition yet.\n\nCalCare aka AB1400 will be debated in the CA Assembly in January.  The deadline to pass this bill is January 31.  We need to get as much popular support as possible.  Last time, 5 years ago, the Senate passed it but it got killed in the Assembly.  This time, we started it in the Assembly, because that is the harder nut to crack.  Dist 02 Assemblyman, Jim Wood, has stated that he is willing to debate whatever healthcare bill comes up in his Assembly Health Committee, which he chairs.  \n\nThe goal of the phone bank is to remind known supporters to sign the petition in support of CalCare, and urge people to call their Assemblyperson, which will most likely be Jim Wood.

Nothing major, but still side effects. Why would I volunteer myself for even the slightest negative side effect when Covid rates are declining and Covid has been a non issue for me so far?  I just don\u2019t understand why I am not allowed to choose to opt out of the vaccine when I have tested positive for antibodies?"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635867595,"title":"Not getting vaccinated","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"satxpolitics","created_utc":1635867776,"title":"At 27, Frank Ramirez could become youngest Texas House rep.

I have tried using google but I get flooded with click-bait articles that have nothing to do with what I am looking for.\n\nThe only example I will give is that we can clearly look back on the choice to abolish slavery and agree it was the right decision. At the time there were obviously people that disagreed but now there is a definite consensus among reasonable people, across the entire population, that keeping slavery would be wrong and abolishing it was the correct thing to do. (Yes, the choice to Declare Independence from Great Britain is also, but that was the establishing of our country, I am interested in things that we have had to deal with since then.)\n\nThis is the only example (or 2 I guess) I will give in order to minimize skewing and let you all be creative.

There have been at least [two](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/republicans-are-gnawing-at-the-foundations-of-americas-free-and-fair-elections\/2021\/06\/13\/3f40ffa0-cacd-11eb-a11b-6c6191ccd599_story.html) WaPo [op-eds](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/2021\/10\/09\/without-these-changes-us-democracy-will-remain-vulnerable-trump-other-bad-actors\/) raising the prospect.  Bill Maher warned darkly on his HBO show of a \"slow moving coup\" and got a fair bit of attention for it elsewhere in the media, including [CNN.](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/10\/11\/media\/donald-trump-slow-moving-coup\/index.html)\n\nOkay, I'm convinced: alarm successfully raised!  But what I really want to understand is the nuts and bolts or \"tick tock\" of exactly how this would play out.  All the reading and Googling I have done have failed to dispel the murkiness.  I'm hoping there are Constitutional law experts here, or at least attorneys familiar with election law, who can shed some light.\n\nI have the sense that these officials or legislatures would declare the state won by Trump even if the actual votes were greater for the Democratic nominee.  Would they change the popular vote tallies or just declare them irrelevant, stating that they have the authority to choose electors regardless of who wins the \"beauty contest\" or \"straw poll\"?  I have some sense there is ambiguity in the Constitution as to whether this is allowed, but I imagine the Supreme Court will weigh in and Roberts might defect but they would be likely to get five votes supporting the Republican side.\n\nWould it be [like 1876?](https:\/\/millercenter.org\/the-presidency\/educational-resources\/disputed-election-1876)  \n\n>Republicans and Democrats rushed to those three states to watch and try to influence the counting of the votes. The returning boards determined which votes to count and could throw out votes, if they deemed them fraudulent. The returning boards in all three states argued that fraud, intimidation, and violence in certain districts invalidated votes, and they threw out enough Democratic votes for Hayes to win.\n\nThat sounds an awful lot like what is being predicted.  But in that case multiple slates of electors showed up to cast votes, which I guess wouldn't happen now due to the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which makes the 1876 experience less relevant as a precedent, since it was designed to clarify issues that came up there.\n\nBut this Act is one of the things these editorialists have warned needs to be updated, and reading the [Wikipedia article](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electoral_Count_Act) about it I was unable to come up with clarity on how this would play out.  Does it pretty much come down to a state's governor and who they say won the state's electoral votes?  Yesterday's results are even more disturbing in that case, given that those are two states Democrats will sorely need in their column in the presidential election.  But hopefully Republican governors wouldn't endorse an alternate electoral slate if the popular vote wasn't even close?  Hopefully?\n\nStill, there's an ominous quote in that Wiki article from the execrable Bush v. Gore decision:\n\n>\"\\[T\\]he state legislature's power to select the manner for appointing electors is plenary; it may, if it so chooses, select the electors itself, which indeed was the manner used by state legislatures in several States for many years after the framing of our Constitution...The State, of course, after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint electors.\"\n\nIf they got five votes for that decision in 2000, there's no way we'd get five votes overturning it now."},{"author":"throwaway1928384444","created_utc":1635957043,"title":"Truth","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Andrei_CareE","created_utc":1635957417,"title":"Will Murphy win in New Jersey?","num_comments":21,"description":"The Election is still too close to call, unexpectedly\n\nThe Republicans have the energy on their side, while democrats didn't show to vote in big enough numbers.\n\nEdit: The Republicans took the lead again."},{"author":"t_11","created_utc":1635959064,"title":"Oh this takes the cake...","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635959292,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"temporary_whatever","created_utc":1635959314,"title":"Michelle Wu makes history as first person of color and woman to be elected Boston mayor","num_comments":10,"description":""},{"author":"XxDankShrekSniperxX","created_utc":1635961722,"title":"Even though John Lujan won the HD118 special election in San Antonio, he'll never vote on anything because the legislature isn't in session, and the seat is up for election again in 2022","num_comments":0,"description":"Fortnite default dance bass boosted 4KHD"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635964921,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1635965622,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"strongerthenbefore20","created_utc":1635965886,"title":"What do you think are the Democratic Party's biggest problems in relation to their ability to get votes and win elections?","num_comments":82,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"imll99","created_utc":1635966303,"title":"U.S. Launches Net-Zero World Initiative to Accelerate Global Energy System Decarbonization","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1635968432,"title":"Did Latinos support Gavin Newsom in the California recall election?

Write increased powers into the FEC with additional members with a lot TON of authority, and jam up the courts ability to stop all FEC enforcement actions against dark money candidates in 2022 and 2024. This will make the bill seem more like a bureaucratic maneuver with the effects unknown, that will help it pass the senate with 50+1 votes. The public wont really know the true effects but thats why democrats have to set up all these safeguards prior to 2022 and 24.\n\nI dont know how the filibuster will play out, but if these two are presented with a plan to get as many people to vote as possible and greatly enhancing the FEC's powers, I dont see how any democrat wouldnt want that.

Please check my submitted history to find the first nine parts of this series.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Fall 2021 House Offense Update**  \n\nWith the approach of 2022 comes a brand new redistricting cycle which occurs once every 10 years. When it comes to redistricting cycles, there will be opportunities to make key gains in the House of Representatives. However, there will be far more pressing tasks to defend districts that we currently hold from the Republicans, as such areas will become far more hostile to operate in when their new boundaries are established. This is especially true since the 2020 elections left the Republicans with far more state trifectas than we currently have. Think of redistricting as one big great reset where the country is about to face uncharted territory when deciding who gets to shape the new world as it unfolds. In short, the 2022 political environment is very much a dynamic one, where we can expect far more change than we would normally face in an election cycle. This series will review House defense techniques, how well we carry them out in various regions, and what we can do to improve our operations.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn this part, we will undertake an updated comprehensive review on the 6 districts that this series has targeted for flipping in the 2022 elections. Since the previous House offense update, plenty of developments have occurred which provides us with some key signs where our best pickups are located. Most notably among them are the release of the new congressional maps for 10 of the 44 states apportioned with multiple districts this decade, a couple of which have created new districts that we can pick up given proper campaigning. These developments have thus compelled me to make significant changes to the series\u2019 offense list. So before I begin my official review, I will first explain my reasoning behind this changes. All districts listed in this part will include their PVI and either their incumbents or an OPEN label signifying the lack of one. Districts within states where their redistricting processes are complete will be marked with an asterisk (\\*) to indicate that their boundaries have been finalized for this decade.  I will **not** be including ratings from any political pundits in this step, since doing so will be of little use until the redistricting process is completed for every state that is apportioned more than one House seat.  \n\nTo keep the offense list to an effective size, I have kept the number of offense districts to a constant 6. For those of you who are wondering why I only have 6 districts on the offense list, this is because I am adhering to the stance that 75% of this series will be focused on defending House districts. I believe that defending House districts should be our main focus this election cycle, as we should not depend on flipping any Republican-held House districts at this point to save our majority. Trying to flip any such district takes massive amounts of organization and resources, and there are many potential problems that could cause these attempts to fail. The reasoning for the removal\/addition of each district from\/to the list is listed below.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNo longer on the offense list:  \n\nNE-02\\* (Don Bacon, R+1):  \n\nSeveral factors are working against us in this particular district. For starters, the Nebraska state legislature made this district several points more Republican, which makes our task considerably harder. There is also the fact that Don Bacon is decently attempting to craft a moderate brand by voting for the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The decision to remove this district from the offense list is tough, but I believe that it is the right call at present in order to make room for some promising districts that deserve our full attention and support.  \n\nCA-21 (David Valadao, D+5):  \n\nNow, I know what you are thinking: Why am I removing the most Democratic district (according to the Cook PVI) that is currently represented by a Republican? To be blunt, we have far too many disadvantages against us this cycle, as much as I hate to say this. First and foremost, this race was stalled for too long for us to develop the necessary voter outreach measures to reach out to the district\u2019s Hispanic population. Because the national groups waited several months for State Assemblymember Rudy Salas to enter the race, none of our candidates are raising enough money to attract key national groups and build up the necessary name recognition. The advantage of incumbency is extremely strong in the San Joaquin Valley, which this district is located in, since its Hispanic population is not politically engaged. Additionally, David Valadao was one of the 10 Republicans to vote for Trump\u2019s second impeachment, which means that moderate Republican groups like the Lincoln Project are not going to help our cause at all here. Then, we have to consolidate the Democratic field in order to prevent a top two lockout between Chris Mathys and David Valadao. Given the infighting that is taking place among this district\u2019s Democrats, I do not see this consolidation taking place anytime soon. It is very much a painful omission, but I believe there are more promising districts which need our attention this cycle. I am saying this as someone who is well-versed in California politics.  \n\nCA-25 (Mike Garcia, D+3):  \n\nThe Democratic primary in this district is **way** too heated right now. Several candidates are attacking each other in social media and campaign mailers, and the risk of etiquette violations is far too high if I provide any further details here. We will not win the district\u2019s next version if we go down this personal path, as it will weaken our general election prospects in this area. I believe it best to remove this district from the offense list and wait until these primary spats die down. The district has a strong Democratic activist base that is ready to support Mike Garcia\u2019s eventual challenger, so we will be very much ready to get things moving as soon as the said challenger is selected. For those of us who live in this district, I suggest you focus on the AD-38 race if you want to help improve our campaign infrastructure there, as it does not have the same problems as the CA-25 race has. The Democrats running for this State Assembly seat are Artin Sodaify, Jonathan Ahmadi, Annie Cho, and Pilar Schiavo, and I encourage you to take a look at their campaigns and support the candidate who you think is the most viable.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNew districts added to the offense list:  \n\nCO-08\\* (OPEN, R+1):  \n\nColorado\u2019s redistricting process created a new highly competitive district. It is slightly more Republican than the nation as a whole, so winning the new district will take a serious effort from start to finish. There is also the fact that Colorado\u2019s statewide races could get competitive as this cycle progresses and this area will be front and center when it comes to winning votes for these races.  \n\nPA-01 (Brian Fitzpatrick, EVEN):  \n\nI initially removed this list in the seventh part because we did not even have a candidate running in this district and Brian Fitzpatrick had already broken the $1 million fundraising mark at that time. However, I do feel that the situations has changed enough for this district to be added back in the offense list, as we now have a couple of candidates running there who could develop a credible challenge against Brian Fitzpatrick if enough resources and volunteer efforts were devoted to their campaigns. However, trying to flip this district\u2019s next version is an enormous ask and requires a lot of things to go right.  \n\nOR-06\\* (OPEN, D+4):  \n\nThis is another newly created district from a redistricting process. Oregon\u2019s state legislature was smart enough to give this new district a significantly Democratic lean, but it will still require sensible campaigning to put this district in our column in 2022.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow that we have gone through my reasoning for the offense list changes, my official review of our status in the 6 target districts will begin. The six target districts are CO-08, PA-01, NY-24, CA-39, FL-27, and OR-06. In each of these districts, a list of the Democratic candidates who have filed to run, their campaign websites (if they have one), as well as the amount of money they have raised according to the 2021 Q3 FEC reports (if one is filed) will be provided. No self-loans are included in any posted fundraising figures to provide an accurate picture of a candidate's overall appeal. An overall analysis will also be supplied for each district. All candidates come from the Green Papers website. In each district, I will bold the candidate who I feel is the strongest at this point, assuming that no other candidates jump in later. Factors such as any elected offices the candidates currently hold, the size of their fundraising, and their overall campaign website quality are considered when identifying the frontrunner. Some candidates are indicated with a minus or a plus, which indicates the overall quality of their campaign websites (if they have one) according to criteria that was listed in the fourth part of this series.  \n\n**No donation pages to candidates or even nominee funds will be posted in this step.** Any donations intended for retaining House control should be reserved until the 2022 congressional map is fully established for every state. When that time comes, nominee funds will be the first type of donation pages that this series will promote.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nCO-08\\* (OPEN, R+1):  \n\n**Yadira Caraveo (+) \u2013  $107,525; https:\/\/www.caraveoforcongress.com\/**  \nChares Tedesco \u2013 No report filed yet; https:\/\/www.tedescoforcongress.com\/  \n\nWhile the Democratic field for this district is still taking shape, we are honestly making good progress so far. That is because State Representative Yadira Caraveo has a fully organized campaign website that includes Spanish language pages, sports plenty of endorsements at the state legislative level, and has already raised a respectable six figure sum. From what I understand, she accomplished this by making plenty of well-placed moves while Colorado\u2019s new congressional district was still taking shape. And it can be said that these preparations currently make her the primary frontrunner. Adams County Commissioner Chares Tedesco could also surprise us with a strong campaign, so I do recommend that you take a look at his campaign platform as well. The district has an electorate that is 38.5% Hispanic, so any candidate needs to develop Spanish language campaign outreach programs and materials to attract these types of voters. Candidates also need to bridge the urban-rural divide caused by the district\u2019s mashup of Colorado\u2019s Weld and Adams counties.   \n\nPA-01 (Brian Fitzpatrick, EVEN):  \n\n**Paul Fermo \u2013 No report filed yet; https:\/\/www.paulfermoforcongress.com\/**  \nAshley Ehasz (-) \u2013 No report filet yet; https:\/\/www.ehaszforcongress.com\/  \n\nThis is another district where the Democratic field is starting to take shape, but I feel that there is some promise from the two candidates who have decided to run in this district. Right now, Paul Fermo has a *very* slight advantage since he has a slightly more organized campaign website that takes down volunteer information. More candidates could join this Democratic primary, so I highly advise to keep an open mind and look at each candidate\u2019s platform before making your decision. As I have said, however, this district is a reach, and requires a lot of things to go right for us to flip its next version. It is very possible that this district gets replaced for a more promising target, so everyone should also be prepared for this possibility as well.  \n\nNY-24 (John Katko, D+2):  \n\n**Francis Conole (-) \u2013 $236,986; https:\/\/www.conoleforcongress.com\/**  \nSteven Wesley Holden Sr (+) \u2013 $44,122; https:\/\/www.believeinsteve.online\/  \n\nAs of now, Francis Conole is the frontrunner in this district\u2019s primary due to the respectable amounts of name recognition from his previous 2020 campaign, which has translated into a decent fundraising haul in 2021\u2019s third quarter. However, John Katko is a rather difficult incumbent to unseat, and **plenty** of things need to go right for us to win here. Even though this is a Democratic leaning district, John Katko has constantly won re-election by frustratingly large margins every time. A lot of this is because he is one of the few Republicans who can *truly* be called a moderate Republican in today\u2019s political scene. Some examples include his votes for Trump\u2019s second impeachment, stripping Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, and most recently for the bipartisan infrastructure bill. So how do we get him voted out in 2022? It begins by improving voter outreach efforts in Auburn, Syracuse, and Skaneateles, as that is where many of the voters who split their tickets between Joe Biden and John Katko in 2020 reside. We also need to push the New York state legislature to make the district much more Democratic in the redistricting process, since New York has a Democratic trifecta. Then, we need to develop voter outreach plans for a scenario in which John Katko either loses his 2022 Republican primary, or comes out of it severely weakened and low on resources. All of these things can occur, which makes the district worth investing our volunteer hours in.  \n\nCA-39 (Young Kim, D+3):  \n\n**Jay Chen \u2013 $1,094,340; https:\/\/www.chenforcongress.com\/**  \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I provided plenty of low-profile support to several operatives who are working on Jay Chen\u2019s campaign, and thus know a lot about its developments. In fact, plenty of officials from the local and congressional level have endorsed Jay Chen. Various types of Asians make up a quarter of the district\u2019s electorate, and having clear and concise messaging to these groups is *mandatory*. There are Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Japanese communities with a substantial presence in this area and have their own cultures that any candidate must respect when courting their votes. Jay Chen\u2019s campaign staff is thus developing plans to reach out to all of these types of Asian voters. Right now, these volunteers are participating in voter registration drives in Fullerton held by Field Team 6. Fullerton is a city where any candidate needs to campaign in, as it makes up over one sixth of CA-39\u2019s population and voted against Trump twice after constantly voting for the Republican presidential candidate since **1976**. At this point, I believe that he will be Young Kim\u2019s general election challenger, as he has locked down every type of local support that a Democrat could obtain in this district. *All* of the volunteers I know who worked on California congressional campaigns in 2020 and are active this cycle have regrouped at Jay Chen's campaign. **That** is how promising Jay Chen is as a candidate, who has continued to lead the pack when it comes to challenger campaigns this cycle. If I had to predict just one district that would flip to our side in 2022 if the House election were held today, it would easily be this one.  \n\nFL-27 (Maria Elvira Salazar, D+4):  \n\n**Angel Montalvo (+) \u2013 $4,194 (\u201cThis Period\u201d numbers used, as \u201cElection Cycle-To-Date\u201d numbers in report seemed illogical); https:\/\/www.montalvoforcongress.com\/**  \n\nThis race is currently stalled due to Janelle Perez\u2019s recent decision to switch from this race to the FL SD-37 race and because several potential Democratic candidates are waiting how Florida\u2019s redistricting process plays out before making any decisions on running. Out of these candidates, State Representative Nick Duran seems to be the most promising potential recruit for this district. For now, Angel Montalvo is the only active Democrat running here. In order to flip this district\u2019s next version, we need to follow a very specific strategy. The district\u2019s electorate is very politically diverse, which includes a conservative Latino community that we need to keep our losing margins down in, and a sizable population of progressive University of Miami students that we must turn out in Election Day. This means that candidates cannot use moderate and progressive labels when describing themselves or their campaign platforms, as doing so will anger at least one of the two aforementioned groups. The Miami-Dade Democratic Party also needs to develop effective Spanish language community outreach measures and highly organized volunteer operations. That is because our biggest weaknesses in this particular area originate from our historically substandard performances in Miami-Dade County when it comes to both of these types of activities. No path to victory there exists without fixing these shortcomings in time for the 2022 House elections.  \n\nOR-06\\* (OPEN, D+4):  \n\nKevin Easton (+) \u2013 No official FEC report filed, but less than $5,000; https:\/\/www.voteeaston.com\/  \nDerry Al Jackson \u2013 No report filed yet; https:\/\/www.jacksonforcongress503.com\/  \nSteven Cody Reynolds (-) \u2013 No report filed yet; No website yet  \n**Loretta Smith (-) \u2013 $115,032; https:\/\/www.lorettaforcongress.com\/**  \nMatthew West \u2013 No report filed yet; https:\/\/www.mattwestforcongress.com\/  \n\nThe Democratic field for this newly drawn district is starting to take shape, but there are already quite a few candidates who are seeking the Democratic nomination here. Out of the five Democrats running, former Multnomah County Commissioner Lorettta Smith seems to be the frontrunner since she has already raised a respectable six-figure sum. However, this primary is anyone\u2019s game right now, and I strongly suggest looking at every candidate\u2019s platform before making your choice. In particular, I am curious to see if former Portland School Board Member Derry Al Jackson can develop a strong showing before the year is out, as his ideas are unorthodox, but possibly effective if the right messaging is employed.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell, that is all that I have to say for this part. While the House offense situation is certainly different than it was several months ago, we have plenty of work to do on that end. Any further information or general suggestions would be appreciated.

Therefore, American democracy effectively undermines itself by giving a racist, civically illiterate, QAnon-believing truck driver the same amount of influence in government as a person with a doctorate in political science. Hence, he proposes \u201cepistocracy\u201d (rule by the knowledgeable) as an alternative to democracy.\n\nBrennan puts forth several proposals for what that might look like, but many are impractical, and none of them particularly improve on the status quo. Some (like bringing back literacy or knowledge tests as a requirement to vote) might even make things worse in other ways, like exacerbating existing racial inequities.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about what happens when democracy gives too much power to the ignorant mobs, who subsequently pose a threat to democracy itself. Plato considered the same problem in the wake of Socrates\u2019 execution\u2014he, like Brennan, ended up rejecting democracy for epistocracy. Indeed, the story of Socrates seems very relevant these days due to the wave of Republican harassment directed against educators and school boards. \n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a easy solution that _doesn\u2019t_ require abandoning democracy or \u201cone person one vote\u201d. Because unlike Athens, the USA has a _representative_ democracy rather than a direct one. It\u2019s not essential that every voter understands all the issues, only that the _representatives_ do.\n\nSo, the federal government could pass a law that every candidate in a federal election (Congress, president, or VP) must have earned a certificate indicating a basic knowledge of civics and public policy (as well as other related issues like how the scientific method works). The government itself would fund the classes and they would be available for free for anyone to take. States could pass similar laws as well directed at candidates for statewide elections.\n\nThe purpose of the law wouldn\u2019t be to benefit one party or the other (although the candidates it would screen out are disproportionately Republican). In fact, the biggest beneficiaries would probably be anti-Trump\/pro-Constitution Republicans like Adam Kinzinger, since they would face fewer populist threats in primaries. _But_, it would at least mean far fewer know-nothings like Greene and Boebert would make it in, and these kinds of politicians currently represent the greatest threat to democracy.\n\nI don\u2019t think the Constitution would forbid such a law\u2014it merely states there must be no _religious_ test for public office, but it doesn\u2019t say anything about educational tests. And since it only applies to candidates and not voters, it doesn\u2019t disenfranchise anyone. I\u2019m not sure if there would be any other obstacles to implementing this, but if there are, I can\u2019t think of any."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636609487,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"mustang6172","created_utc":1636610080,"title":"Liberal Hypocrisy is Fueling American Inequality.

Demand elasticity has to do with how quickly demand will change in regards to price. For example, healthcare has an inelastic demand, much moreso than leisure. However, in a competitive market, that doesn't really matter. The problem comes when such a market is captured by one or a handful of providers. This can easily occur in a market with an inelastic supply because new providers can't easily provide more of that good. This is particularly the case with land which is about as close to inelastic on both sides as it gets. We need land to live and work on but land is a fixed good. Furthermore, not just any land will do because land in the middle of Alaska isn't as well desired as land in Manhattan or San Francisco.\n\nThere are three factors of production.\n\nLabor: Effort by man to make or do something\n\nLand: Anything natural such as natural resources or land itself\n\nCapital: Anything made by man\n\nNow the issue I take with this setup is that natural resources have more in common with capital than with land itself. Natural resources can't be made but they can be discovered. Even if it's non renewable, we can keep on discovering new reserves (that's why peak oil never happened). Furthermore, resources can be used more efficiently.\n\nLand: Anything in fixed supply in which value can only be added through speculation. Examples include land, intellectual property, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and even geostationary orbits.\n\nCapital: Everything else, mainly that which can be created through investment.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a man by the name of Henry George wrote a book called *Progress and Poverty*. In it, he sought to answer a question. The industrial revolution had given the US and UK so much wealth. Why then was there still poverty? Henry George's answer was that the ownership of land was the main culprit. His reasoning was that people (mainly those of affluence) were buying up land and gaining leverage over others. All of that investment in land left less left over for labor and capital. It wasn't just an affront to economic equality but also efficiency because land speculation hoards land from being used.\n\nProfit is also split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land).\n\nHenry George pointed out just how people can profit from land speculation without contributing to society.\n\n>Take now... some hard-headed business man, who has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: \"Here is a little village; in ten years it will be a great city\u2014in ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will in ten years, interest be any higher?\" He will tell you, \"No!\" \"Will the wages of the common labor be any higher...?\" He will tell you, \"No the wages of common labor will not be any higher...\" \"What, then, will be higher?\" \"Rent, the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold possession.\" And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the *lazzaroni* of Naples or the *leperos* of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon or down a hole in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota of wealth to the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city you may have a luxurious mansion, but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.\n\nTo fix this, George proposed a land value tax. It's similar to a property tax except it doesn't tax the whole property, just the land on which it sits. This would deter land speculation and incentivize land owners to use the land as efficiently as possible. It also wouldn't penalize upgrading property because it would only affect land. A whole movement started around it called the single tax movement. This movement competed with socialism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But for whatever reason, georgism died out. It's now seeing a slow revival in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which was caused by land speculation. Georgism saw sympathy from people like Albert Einstein, FDR, Hellen Keller, and Winston Churchill. Convincing people that this will be a good idea will most certainly be an uphill battle but enough people are talking about it, it can start a new conversation because we can't achieve the LVT if nobody's heard of it.\n\nAnd the concept predates George. Thomas Paine in *Agrarian Justice* believed in implementing an LVT in addition to an inheritance tax of 10%. 2\/3 of the revenue would go to people over 50 (life expectancy back then) with the remaining third in the form of a basic income.\n\nAdam Smith was likewise very critical of land rent (that's where the phrase \"rent-seeking\" comes from).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Adam Smiths quotes not used by conservatives are just as interesting as the ones that are](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hc5l3w9z6pz71.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=af9fa7c7813d46efcca136a8fd4dc64ba225955f)\n\nHe saw the LVT as the best way for the government to raise revenue since an LVT did not impose deadweight loss on the economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/106pkqy17pz71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=465ebc2e84703b537a1d90819764c91203e922f3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe generally think of economic efficiency and equality as being at odds with one another but the LVT promises to bring us a great deal of both."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636956029,"title":"Let's hope Trump doesn't run in 2024","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636965122,"title":"The Hypocrisy is Just PHENOMENAL With These People","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636971958,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":28,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636986874,"title":"Win Me Over","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1636987149,"title":"Biden set to sign infrastructure bill into law","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1636987371,"title":"O'Rourke announces bid to take on Greg Abbott in 2022 Texas gubernatorial race","num_comments":82,"description":""},{"author":"Mizoue","created_utc":1636987691,"title":"I'm a Republican and I come in peace.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"REDWlNELOVER","created_utc":1636987820,"title":"Trump ally Bannon taken into custody on contempt charges","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1636987840,"title":"Steve Bannon surrenders to FBI on contempt of Congress charges","num_comments":48,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1636988233,"title":"Democrat Beto O'Rourke Running For Texas Governor In 2022","num_comments":24,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636989205,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636989377,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"NewHights1","created_utc":1636989426,"title":"Trump ally Steve Bannon surrenders on contempt charges over Jan. 6 Capitol riot probe","num_comments":2,"description":"[https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/11\/15\/trump-ally-steve-bannon-surrenders-on-charges-stemming-from-jan-6.html](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/11\/15\/trump-ally-steve-bannon-surrenders-on-charges-stemming-from-jan-6.html)"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636989429,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"brokenB42morrow","created_utc":1636991268,"title":"Beto Formally Announces his run for Governor of Texas","num_comments":7,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636991475,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1636992566,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"semaphore-1842","created_utc":1636994125,"title":"Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon surrenders on contempt of Congress charges","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1636996460,"title":"Alex Jones guilty in all four Sandy Hook defamation cases;

After consulting various sources, my investigation into this year\u2019s Election Day has concluded as of last night. If the Democratic Party of Virginia has provided any details on how to improve our standing in that state, please feel free to respond, and I will take them into consideration. Now that we have a somewhat clear picture on the path forward, I am ready to share my findings and provide a somewhat definitive list of what we need to do for the next couple of months.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**In downticket campaigns, I found no misconduct on the volunteers\u2019 part. In fact, their efforts on local issues paid off in spades, which indicate that we need to continue contacting voters as soon as volunteer events are announced.**  \n\nThis is the one thing that we need to take away from this investigation. The frequent criticism that we spent too much time talking about Donald Trump and the 1\/6 insurrection? **None of this was mentioned in the phone banking events and other volunteer activities for our downballot candidates.** Volunteers there were disciplined, almost *never* mentioned Republicans, and stuck to local issues by following detailed scripts. As a result, respondents were mostly supportive of our policies. In fact, there were plenty of voters who split the ticket between Glenn Youngkin and our Democratic candidates in the House of Delegates. Danica Roem is one such example, according to [this article]( https:\/\/www.virginiamercury.com\/2021\/11\/05\/after-crushing-loss-gimmicky-anti-trump-strategy-draws-criticism-from-va-democrats\/). By focusing on *local* issues such as above-ground transmission lines, secure funding for commuter buses, and free school lunches, she was able to convince plenty of Youngkin voters to split their tickets for her. Showing up and volunteering thus *makes a huge difference*, as it shows to voters that you care about their issues. For those of you who volunteered for the House of Delegates campaigns, you are to be commended, especially for those of you who volunteered for Wendy Gooditis and Rodney Willett\u2019s House of Delegates campaigns. Even though we had an extremely bad outcome, we could also have lost these seats in Virginia\u2019s blowout, as pundits predicted these seats also falling to the Republicans. Grassroots groups such as Indivisible organizations were easily the most valuable players and did most of the work in activating most Democrats who showed up to vote in Election Day 2021.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**We need to fully fund all of Virginia\u2019s county parties, as many of them played double duty in the months leading up to Election Day.**\n\nI mean *all* of Virginia\u2019s county parties here. This is not an \u201curban vs. rural\u201d issue, as Glenn Youngkin managed to overperform Trump\u2019s baseline in virtually every area in Virginia, whether it was urban, suburban, and rural. **Every county party thus warrants our proper attention.** According to Fredericksburg Democratic Committee chair Caitlin Bennett, many small county parties and committees ended up [drawing from their own funds](https:\/\/twitter.com\/caitlinfxbg\/status\/1456030787443302404) to pay for basic campaign materials such as signs when Terry McAuliffe\u2019s campaign failed to provide enough of these materials for these localities. Given that many of these groups have had difficulties fundraising due to COVID, these shortages created serious problems in carrying out vital campaign operations. County parties are often an overlooked, but extremely necessary priority, as they carry out important tasks that the national and statewide organizations cannot successfully undertake. In fact, I *just* finished the paperwork and other necessary arrangements to reinstate our volunteer efforts and donations among the contacts I know for several county parties within key areas in Virginia. I am personally looking forward to see whether this new round of assistance will be enough to counter the surges of Republican activism which has emerged in that state throughout the past three weeks.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Coordination campaigns between congressional candidates and the downballot Democrats need to be organized by June 2022.**  \n\nSince there is no U.S. Senate or gubernatorial race in 2022, congressional races will be featured at the top of Virginia\u2019s ballots next year. Given that it is very possible that every House of Delegates seat will be up for election in 2022 since the 2021 elections were carried out using last decade\u2019s map, proper coordinating between House of Delegates and congressional races will be essential to maximize our victory chances up and down the ballot in Virginia. And June 2022 is when these coordination campaigns need to start, as starting any later does not leave enough time for us to contact and turn out enough voters to achieve key victories in the midterm elections. The key congressional districts are VA-02 and VA-07, two swing districts currently represented by Democrats Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger respectively. Both districts have House of Delegates districts that flipped from blue to red in the bloodbath early this month, and heavily shifted Republican from their previous 2017 gubernatorial showings. According to the [certified Virginia gubernatorial results,](https:\/\/twitter.com\/greggiroux\/status\/1460659975093686275) VA-02 went for Youngkin by 8.2 points, while VA-07 went for Youngkin by 10.7 points. Now, I spoke with staffers from both Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger\u2019s re-election campaigns about our situation in these districts. I have to be careful about what I say here, as the details are currently being kept under a tight lid. What I can say is that these staffers are working on appropriate measures to get these coordination campaigns up and running by this tight timeline. They are very nice people who are receptive to the voters\u2019 needs, and are willing to work with anyone wishing to join their efforts to hold the next versions of VA-02 and VA-07. However, the campaigns will not officially kick off until Virginia\u2019s redistricting process is completed in order to be efficient with their resources. As soon as these re-election campaigns provide volunteer events for us to join, we need to begin filling up these events *fast* to prevent the Republicans from gaining further ground in these critical areas. We also need to bring these campaigns together with House of Delegates campaigns that overlap with the two congressional districts\u2019 new versions to ensure that volunteer tasks are efficiently carried out. I personally think that Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger have serious potential to withstand the likely Republican wave coming in 2022. Given that they have already done a lot for us to promote our agenda and undo Trump\u2019s damage, I firmly believe they are worth our full support.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**We need to start boosting Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick\u2019s victory margin in FL-20\u2019s special election.**  \n\nI get that the recount took up a lot of time, but we need to immediately hit the ground running to identify and turn out our voters in order to demonstrate our viability on the statewide level. If we want serious investment in Florida, it begins by demonstrating improved performances from the 2020 baseline. So I want us focused on supporting Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick from now until January 11. If we do not do this, then we are out of in the cold in this state for a very long time, as national organizations are [starting to deprioritize the state](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/states\/florida\/story\/2021\/11\/04\/no-million-dollar-checks-democratic-governors-may-sit-out-florida-1392319) this cycle because of its apparent lack of promise. We won this district by 57.4 points in 2020, and that is the margin we need to beat in January\u2019s special election.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The summary of the necessary tasks for the next several months.**\n\nWe need to continue filling up volunteer events in Virginia, fully fund every Democratic committee and county party in Virginia, set up coordination campaigns between congressional candidates and the downballot Democrats by no later than June 2022, and maximize Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick\u2019s victory margin in FL-20\u2019s January 11 special election. It will be tough but necessary to carry out these responsibilities, as the Republicans are now redoubling their efforts in Virginia and Florida due to their Election Day 2021 victories. I would like all of us to think about how close we are to losing the House of Representatives and the Senate under the current political situation. *We need discipline*, and plenty of adjustments need to be made on our part in order to change the narrative. The Republicans are also watching our every move in these states and are relentlessly looking for any weaknesses in our campaigns to exploit. Like it or not, we are dealing with the consequences of our Virginia loss, which has put our campaigns throughout the country in serious danger of falling to the Republicans. From this point forward, we need to devote ourselves to completing the goals that I outlined above, adhere to locally-focused procedures and tactics, and be responsive to voters\u2019 concerns. If not, then we will lose VA-02 and VA-07 in November 2022, and say goodbye to the House of Representatives in the process. So all of us need to *immediately* get to work."},{"author":"Ch1cken_Nugget_eater","created_utc":1637772283,"title":"What are the upsides of being a democrat","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"ThamilandryLFY","created_utc":1637773018,"title":"Life with Q: Thanksgiving 2021.

They declare themselves to be non-racist **only because they know that racism is \"bad\".** That's why they can be racist and insist that they are not.\n\nWhen you point out their racism, they pivot to \"I know you are but what am I?\" and the result is thread after thread and comment after comment about how Democrats are the \"real racists.\"\n\nThere are other conservative positions that can be boiled down to schoolyard level, for example \"Nobody tells me what to do.\"\n\nAnyway, I was just reading a conservative post about how Republicans freed the slaves\/Democrats are racist yada yada yada and it struck me how close they were to that childish deflection."},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1637862619,"title":"So what do you guys think about tucker Carlson I want your opinions?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"imll99","created_utc":1637864487,"title":"Representative Peter Welch Launches Senate Bid For Leahy's Seat","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1637865521,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1637869007,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":7,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1637869574,"title":"Pentagon launches preemptive strike on Senate UFO law","num_comments":0,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1637870548,"title":"Shaun King is a piece of shit","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Accomplished_Crew630","created_utc":1637872805,"title":"This lady is nuttier than a pecan pie...","num_comments":129,"description":""},{"author":"imll99","created_utc":1637873310,"title":"Biden's Progressive FCC Nominee Receives Unlikely Support From One America News Network","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"myalt08831","created_utc":1637875301,"title":"We should message about friendly neighborhood-and-communities topics when we make big progressive policy pushes.

Their protest said it all: \"No taxation without representation!\" \n\nWell, isn't that the situation we're in today? Democrats in gerrymandered Republican districts have no chance to see their views represented in Congress. And ditto for Republicans in districts ruled by Democrats! A gerrymandered district ensures that a certain class of people **cannot** and **will not** have their views articulated in the national legislature. That's the whole point of re-drawing the map.\n\nSo, couldn't that be the basis of a lawsuit to fight current trends in re-districting? I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know, but -- as a Democrat in Dan Crenshaw's re-drawn Texas district -- I know there is a systematic bias against my voting preferences. As long as we have the current electoral map, I and other progressive citizens of the 2nd District will certainly be taxed, but will **never** get faithful representation... by design.\n\nI think I'll pour myself a cup of tea!"},{"author":"zsreport","created_utc":1638120195,"title":"While Americans mark Thanksgiving, Republicans panned over Harris attack","num_comments":4,"description":""},{"author":"progress18","created_utc":1638126732,"title":"Statement by President Joe Biden on Hanukkah","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1638128674,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"1000000students","created_utc":1638133145,"title":"Because of the actions we\u2019ve taken, in the past three weeks, the number of containers sitting on docks is down 33% \u2014 and shipping prices are down 25%.

While Democrats (and left-leaning independents) represent a majority, or at least a plurality, in the US, the Republicans are kicking our ass due gerrymandering and the way the Senate works. The Repubs have indicated that they will not honor established norms (e.g. the appointment, or lack thereof, of two Supreme Court justices that should have gone to a Democrat; the insistence that the 2020 election was stolen from them). They lie with impunity and then double down when called on it, which only increases their credibility in the eyes of their ~~thralls~~ supporters. They are installing faithful allies in local election precincts that could potentially allow them to do what Trump failed to; overturn the results of an election. Meanwhile, indications are good that we will lose both the House and Senate in 2022. \n\nMy question here is: what is being done about this? What can we do? I, personally, am a nobody; I\u2019ve never held or even run for any sort of public office, and don\u2019t have the charisma to do it even if I wanted to. But I don\u2019t see any indications that the Democratic Party is taking these issues seriously. Or maybe I\u2019m not seeing anything because I live in a safely Democratic state? ISTM the only way to counteract Republican gerrymandering is with Democratic gerrymandering in blue states, and I don\u2019t see that this is happening anywhere.

She will likely get away without consequences because Kevin McCarthy, the leader of the House Republicans, seems entirely unwilling to uphold basic standards of decency.\n\nYet at the same time, a famous Muslim just announced his candidacy for Senate as a Republican, and he has a reasonably good chance of winning.\n\nYep, you guessed it, it\u2019s Dr. Oz. While not everyone knows this, he grew up Muslim and _does_ still identify as one, though he\u2019s somewhat eclectic (mentioning both Sufi mystics and Emmanuel Swedenborg as influences).\n\nSo why aren\u2019t Republicans calling him a terrorist like they\u2019re doing with Omar? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because 1. he\u2019s a Republican, 2. he looks sort of white (being ethnically Turkish rather than Somali), and 3. he\u2019s clean-shaven and wears typical Western attire, so he doesn\u2019t stand out as much as Omar does with her headcovering.\n\nStill, it does seem rather interesting."},{"author":"imll99","created_utc":1638325256,"title":"70+ Percent Of Americans Will Be Fully Vaccinated By The End Of The Year","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"imll99","created_utc":1638327327,"title":"Alison Nathan","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Bass-boy-47","created_utc":1638327637,"title":"2024 Primary","num_comments":7,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1638329235,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Watchdogs66","created_utc":1638337501,"title":"End of November Donation to Help Defend the Senate for the 2022 Midterms","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"UncleBigBanana","created_utc":1638343891,"title":"Powell Finally Admits Inflation Isn\u2019t Transitory","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1638361848,"title":"Democrats in the United States have introduced legislation to prohibit the use of bots in online purchasing","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1638362068,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Lost_Lynx_6430","created_utc":1638362882,"title":"Judge: Arizona Senate can\u2019t claim legislative privilege to avoid election audit records release","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1638367492,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"anoelr1963","created_utc":1638370247,"title":"The Pattern of GOP Voter Fraud In case after case from 2020, it turns out that Republicans were the ones misbehaving at the ballot box.","num_comments":53,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1638371574,"title":"Gov.

And I'm surprised that Biden isn't pushing more forcefully for voting reform. I understand that he has competing priorities (COVID, economic recovery) and he faces a lot of constraints (filibuster, 50-50 Senate, yadda yadda), but this seems existential for the Democratic Party. \n\nSo why isn't Biden pushing harder for voting reform?

Look at the current state of global geopolitics. China has made major advancements in technology and military technology that have completely surprised the US military, and have even surpassed their current capabilities. China is a formidable superpower. They are heavily  investing into science and technology. I work in tech, specifically with designing and building AI, and the rate at which China\u2019s AI and quantum computing capabilities have improved, is alarming. The US recently blacklisted a few Chinese quantum computing companies due to National security reasons. A few things to keep in mind: 1) China\u2019s population surpasses the US\u2019s population by around 1.1 billion people\n2) Most of these people are generating data through their own devices or work devices. \n3) the amount of data generated by China is enormous (just like the US)\n4) China is communist, if they wanted to seize or collect data from anybody and everybody, the could easily do that.\n5) With 1-4 combined, their government will be able to produce VERY powerful AI.\n6) The fact that their population is 4x larger than ours, also means they can apply more manpower to designing and building quantum computers.\n\nI feel like lowering standards for everybody across the board is just a lazy way to fix a problem. Why don\u2019t we focus more on the communities that are affected. Let\u2019s be innovative and try to find a successful methodology that works for young children so we can help them build a better intuition for these problems. Lowering standards won\u2019t utilize the full potential of very gifted students, and it could possibly make California students weaker candidates for admission boards whose state has a higher mathematics standard (just saying that could be a potential outcome). I think the schools should be focusing on how they can make every student progress to at least be caught up or be at the gifted level. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but California is a huge state and makes up a huge portion of the US economy so I feel like it\u2019s important that they innovate and find a successful method. I am afraid that it could set a precedent for other states. If it were to set a precedent, within 10-20 years this would significantly slow us down and we could lose the status as a global superpower (if we don\u2019t within the next few years). If China advances faster than us, then they could potentially dominate us if they invaded our country.\n\n\nTL;DR We shouldn\u2019t lower mathematics education standards because we need to move forward not backward. We are in a quantum computing and AI Cold War, and we need to focus on innovating and how we can efficiently teach STEM. Don\u2019t be lazy and lower standards, take the time to investigate the problem and find a solution.

If you want to end abortions, you don't just make them illegal. Murder (and no, aborting an unviable fetus is not homicide) is illegal, but still happens.\n\nIt's even more infuriating when you review the reasons abortions are requested, and discover (in 2005, at least)\n\n>The reasons most frequently cited were that having a child would interfere with a woman's education, work or ability to care for dependents (74%); that she could not afford a baby now (73%); and that she did not want to be a single mother or was having relationship problems (48%).  \n>  \n>[https:\/\/www.guttmacher.org\/journals\/psrh\/2005\/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives](https:\/\/www.guttmacher.org\/journals\/psrh\/2005\/reasons-us-women-have-abortions-quantitative-and-qualitative-perspectives)\n\nSo clearly, if we provided better and cheaper childcare, and provided economic benefits to expectant mothers, and invested in mental health resources, we'd reduce the number of abortions. Why do Republicans want to do a deranged *reductio ad absurdum* by claiming that Democrats want to MURDER BABIES instead of just doing internet research, saying \"these are the reasons abortions happen, and if we fix these issues, they will become less common,\" and offering productive solutions? Give me a fucking break - most working class Republicans would benefit a ton from having more resources to raise their kids and having mental stability for their loved ones. Why do they refuse to think logically?\n\nPro-choice does not mean pro-abortion in the first place. Democrats aren't holding women at gunpoint and forcing them to have abortions. \n\n&#x200B;"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1639358317,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"kperry51","created_utc":1639358394,"title":"Meeting Beto in Wichita Falls, Texas","num_comments":40,"description":""},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1639358638,"title":"[deleted by user]","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1639366092,"title":"Democrats","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"1000000students","created_utc":1639367519,"title":"Of Course Trump\u2019s Jan. 6 Plot Now Involves Kanye\u2019s Henchwoman Urging Georgia Election Worker to Lie","num_comments":5,"description":""},{"author":"Jeffreyxu0927","created_utc":1639374972,"title":"Why Newsom is bringing up this law.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Jeffreyxu0927","created_utc":1639375134,"title":"Why newsom brought up the Texas-like assault rifle ban","num_comments":17,"description":"If you're unfamiliar, Gavin Newsom is calling for a [Texas style ban on assault rifles](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2021\/12\/12\/newsom-california-guns-texas-abortion-524129).
