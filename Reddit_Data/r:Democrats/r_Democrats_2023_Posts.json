With the blue wall we recognized that generation Z at nearly 100% voted for all democratic positions and election issues. Millennial's changed the long outstanding trend of, \"as you get older you get more conservative\" by reversing the trend becoming more liberal as they age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur local DTC noticed, and an immediate executive committee was held. Volunteers were asked and I volunteered to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeginning of December we decided to take a concerted effort to reach out to all newly registered citizens, got access to our states voting Registry to see who recently registered in our town and by what party. We are targeting the newly Democrat, and independent left-leaning. A team was formed in which a marketing professional, IT services professional project manager, and liaison to the state were all brought on board to help our local group become more engaged with the citizens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat we've done so far is:\n\n\\* Created a website, dedicated email addresses with it, integrated it with our donations system, events calendar integration. Created a webapp for all platforms, and Notifications ping for all web browsers. (This reduces SMS\/MMS costs)\n\n\\* Dedicated phone number which then sends the call to dedicated volunteer to accept all calls SMS and MMS messages. Informs about local events, and signs up for a SMS campaign. \n\n\\* Postcards with QR codes which link to our website and donation links complete with tracking so we know who actually clicks and who actually donates.\n\n\\* Battle cards describing what we have done for our state, how our party is help our state, and why Democrats are the clear choice.\n\n\\* Created brochures, limiting the 3 to 5 subjects of different variations depending on what the person asks for that affect our town directly.\n\n\\* Created social media sites and accounts, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, twitter, tiktok. Created tiles for the local issues and our stance, posting it to playlists. \n\n\\* Created videos on why a person has joined the DTC limiting it to a maximum of 30 to 45 seconds, sending it to youtube, facebook and tiktok. Concentrating on positivity, not negativity.\n\n\\* Promoted events and began reaching out for local in town events posting to our town's main page to promote the event.\n\n\\- NO negativity. No comments will be allowed that are negative to be responded to. No challenges, trolls or others. We just present evidence and we ignore any negativity. No post shall be in opposition to the local Republican government or its staff. We present our side and our site alone and why we feel we are better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My question is now simple**: what are we doing or what should we be doing that we cannot think of right now? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe in finding others to help in achieving our goals and not being so blinded by our desire not to take in input from other people. So what are we doing right and what can we be doing better?"},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1674494186,"title":"Speaker of the House - Randy Rainbow Song Parody","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"blassin_em_hoze","created_utc":1674496030,"title":"Thoughts?","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CommanderKiddie148","created_utc":1674498563,"title":"Speaker of the House - Randy Rainbow Song Parody","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"ImaginationFree6807","created_utc":1674498676,"title":"I\u2019m crying \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1674498802,"title":"Democrats see Mississippi governor\u2019s race as ripe for an upset","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Ssider69","created_utc":1674499122,"title":"Kansas senator's reelection campaign scammed out of $690K","num_comments":13,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1674499547,"title":"PA Republicans Quietly Plot Their Revenge After 2022 Wipeout","num_comments":21,"description":""},{"author":"BlankVerse","created_utc":1674499841,"title":"\u201cWhen We Fight, We Win\u201d: Kamala Harris Strikes Hopeful Note on 50th Anniversary of Roe v.

Trump, is now seeking a \u201cvery substantial\u201d additional amount in response to his insults on a CNN program just a day after she won her sexual abuse and defamation case.\n\nMs. Carroll\u2019s filing Monday in Manhattan federal court seeks to intensify the financial pain for Mr. Trump. The jury in her civil case found him liable on May 9 for sexual abuse and defamation. It ordered him to pay Ms. Carroll, a former advice columnist and fixture in Manhattan\u2019s media circles, $2 million for the sexual abuse and $3 million for the defamation.\n\nMonday\u2019s filing came in a separate defamation lawsuit that Ms. Carroll had filed in 2019 against Mr. Trump, 76, which is before the same judge who presided in the civil trial. The older case stemmed from comments Mr. Trump made that year, shortly after she said that he had raped her in a Manhattan department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. That lawsuit had been sidetracked by appeals, but is still pending.\n\nIn a separate letter to the judge, Ms. Carroll\u2019s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, revealed with little elaboration that Mr. Trump has threatened to file a lawsuit against Ms. Carroll \u201cin retaliation and possibly to seek sanctions.\u201d"},{"author":"DeusBex","created_utc":1684793794,"title":"Tim Scott\u2019s political career boils down to these three words","num_comments":42,"description":""},{"author":"Souled_Out","created_utc":1684794218,"title":"Special Counsel Scrutinizing The Former President\u2019s Handling Of Classified Documents Issued a Subpoena To The Trump Organization Seeking Records Related To Seven Countries","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"wdcmsnbcgay","created_utc":1684794570,"title":"Wisconsin School District to Fire Teacher Over Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus Song 'Rainbowland'","num_comments":14,"description":""},{"author":"Baba10x","created_utc":1684805916,"title":"Nixon or Trump: Worst crook","num_comments":174,"description":"Watching White House Plumbers on HBO Max and couldn\u2019t resist asking this question"},{"author":"TillThen96","created_utc":1684806032,"title":"We agree, Marge!

However, political polarization and heated rhetoric have become increasingly common in the United States, particularly on social media, where people may feel emboldened to make extreme statements.\n\nThe use of the term \"fascist\" to describe political opponents is not unique to Democrats or the United States. It's a term that has been used by people across the political spectrum to attack their opponents. The term \"fascist\" is often used as a catch-all insult to describe someone with whom one disagrees politically.\n\nHowever, the term \"fascist\" has a specific historical context and political definition. Fascism is a far-right political ideology that emerged in Europe in the early 20th century. Fascists believe in authoritarian government, the supremacy of the nation or race, and the use of violence to achieve political goals. Fascist regimes are often characterized by a single-party system, censorship, propaganda, and suppression of individual rights and freedoms.\n\nIt's important to note that labeling someone as a fascist is a serious accusation, and it is not a term that should be used lightly. While there may be rhetorical value in using such a charged term, it can also be counterproductive to civil discourse and may further polarize political divisions. It's important to engage in respectful and reasoned debate, even when discussing contentious political issues."},{"author":"CarRemarkable2704","created_utc":1684997845,"title":"Early MAGA Movement.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"nasavideos2023","created_utc":1685009272,"title":"Ron Desantis's presidential launch crashes and burns | Ft.

Joe Morrissey last week.\n\nWhat's happening: In court filings, she alleges he abused her, had sex with her when she was still a minor and had numerous affairs.\n\nJoe Morrissey denied the allegations in the filing.\nWhy it matters: The state lawmaker is in the midst of a contentious Democratic primary and in the past has put his marriage front and center as he rebuilt his political career after a string of scandals.\n\nFlashback: He was convicted in 2014 on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in connection to his relationship with his now-wife and served 90 days in jail.\n\nHe was 55, and she was 17 when they met.\nFormer Gov. Ralph Northam pardoned him last year before leaving office.\nThe latest: While both Morrisseys have previously denied any underage sexual encounter, Myrna Morrissey now alleges in her divorce filing that the two had \"a sexual relationship\" while she was still underage.\n\nShe alleges Joe Morrissey coached her through the police investigation, including by allegedly instructing her to \"throw your phone in the river\" and instructing a legislative staffer to purchase them both burner phones.\nThe two were married in 2016, but Myrna Morrissey now alleges she was aware of infidelities and in 2018 told Joe Morrissey she wanted a divorce.\n\nShe alleges he convinced her to stay \"because he was about to run for State Senate, and a divorce would hurt his campaign. He desired to portray their 'family' life to help him overcome the stigma created by their illicit relationship.\"\nMyrna Morrissey alleges emotional, verbal and physical abuse, accusing her husband of calling her names like \"ghetto rat\" and making \"unflattering remarks regarding her race.\"\n\nShe alleges he deliberately elbowed her in the stomach while she was pregnant with their third child and, in another encounter, choked her and slammed her against a wall.\nThe filing also challenges Joe Morrissey's 2022 pardon by Northam, alleging her husband drafted an affidavit submitted in her name supporting the request and saying she \"has no recollection of ever actually signing\" it.\n\nThe other side: \"I'm very disappointed that Myrna has done this,\" Joe Morrissey told Axios. \"I love Myrna. It breaks my heart that she is airing these absolutely false allegations. And everybody that knows me and her \u2014 everybody \u2014 knows that I've always treated Myrna with respect and like a queen.\"\n\nOf note: Myrna Morrissey first went public with her desire for a divorce early this year, calling the marriage \"the biggest mistake of my life.\"\n\nZoom out: Joe Morrissey is being challenged in the Democratic primary by former Petersburg Del. Lashrecse Aird.\n\nThe race is drawing outsized attention because of Morrissey's past support for anti-abortion rights legislation, which Aird has pledged to oppose.

He demanded and got a two year deal\n\n* He not only got McCarthy to agree to raise the debt ceiling, but to eliminate the ceiling altogether for those two years.\n\n* Biden used the debt ceiling negotiations to strike a deal on the annual budget negotiations which would have had to be completed by October 1st. \n\n* He has basically made three deals in one:\n\n1: ----------This year\u2019s debt ceiling deal\n\n2: ----------This year\u2019s budget negotiation\n\n3: ----------Next year\u2019s debt ceiling deal\n\n\n* The $80 billion for the IRS which Kevin McCarthy and the GOP demanded be eliminated, was only reduced to $70 billion which is still the largest increase to the agency in history\n\n* Then Biden will take that $10 billion and spread it across areas of so-called spending cuts to neutralize those spending cuts.\n\n* It appears that  Biden has let them cut food stamps but in reality he got more money and more people will be covered\n\n* Republicans had demanded 18% spending cuts across the board in all government programs except the military. They got none of that.\n\n* And though Biden is clearly the winner in this battle, he can not claim victory yet\u2026, (yet being the key word). Otherwise the republicans may change their mind on voting for it. He is clearly letting them think they won. Well at least that they didn\u2019t lose.\n\n* Biden made it appear McCarthy had a victory by \u201cforcing\u201d Biden to negotiate. And got republicans to believe that.  In reality they got nothing. They only achieved the appearance of a win. Biden didn\u2019t care how it made him look. He just gave McCarthy something to claim as a win.\n\n**And just a couple hours ago, the House Rules Committee controlled by republicans voted 7-6 to allow the deal to be voted on tomorrow.**\n\nAs a personal guess, I think a secret deal made have been made to have democrats save McCarthy from getting voted out in the battle that will most definitely occur after the deal is passed. I have no evidence to support this. It's just my prediction.\n\n\n\nJoe Biden and Steve Ricchetti are master negotiators. Never in a thousand years could we expected this to end better.

We need our campaigns to be more grounded in reality. My idea, campaigning as reality TV. Hear me out\u2026\n\nA Modest Proposal:\n\nProblem: It seems (Maybe someone has some data on this. If so, please share.) that 90% of voters get their political info via media of some sort. And, of that crowd, they are receiving self-selected, self-reaffirming content. Across the political spectrum we see this. \n\nThere of course are exceptions and some folks go out of their way to be informed. I am just saying, some folks go looking for info, some folks needed it yelled at them 20 time a day for months for it to sink in, then it is the gospel. \n\nProblem: While even the most truthful campaign messaging still only (in a majority of cases) highlights the notable, relatable, and easily digestible aspects of a candidate. We don\u2019t know who these people are. We know exactly what we have been told and nothing else. \n\nProblem: Big Business and large Special Interest groups are controlling the narrative. Either that narrative is negative against corporate interests or positive, Both ways, Amazon is going to be part of the political discourse. Amazon gets earned media all day long. These influences need to be much less impactful and\/or eliminated from campaign discourse. \n\nSolution: In order to better understand our candidates and to gain greater insight into their skills in the vital areas of problem solving, situational awareness, intellect, and conduct under pressure, I make the following proposal:\n\n1. All candidates for federal office must participate in 3 televised events during the course of the campaign cycle. These events will consist of 1 knowledge based event, one fitness event, and 1 wild card event to be selected at random from the previous year\u2019s top reality shows. \n\n2. Performance during these events will have no impact on a candidates ballot access nor will the winners (or losers) receive any advantage or disadvantage other than impacts to public perception. \n\n3. Extreme safety measures. We aren\u2019t ready for full incorporation of a Thunderdome\u2026.yet.\n\nRationale: Campaigning has become a circus. Either we need broad, wide-spread retooling of how elections and the campaigns for the elections are conducted. \n\nOr\u2026\n\nLean into it. I can not think of a better way to get to know someone than to play taboo or spades with a person. You will get a deep, rich understanding of how a person thinks, reacts, and navigates complex interpersonal relationships when than individual is asked to explain the concept of \u201cHoax\u201d without using the words Lie, False, True, Cheat, or Trick to their spouse. \n\nWe are constantly debating wither or not someone is \u201cphysically able to do the job.\u201d I don\u2019t want Dr. Teeth IRL telling me that the 85 year old candidate does 100 jumping jacks every morning and makes sure to keep a heart rate above 120 for 20 min while making love. Show me how they react when they are left on an island for a week with nothing more than 1 person item. I would be able to gather a lot about the character of a candidate by what that one item was. I wonder how many would bring a Bible?\n\nOverall, I am sick of hearing the same messaging telling me why this senior citizen is better than that trust-fund baby. \n\nI know some people are going to say that this is silly and doesn\u2019t make sense. Well, I would retort, the Electoral College is still a thing, so\u2026..\n\n\u201cLive with a man 40 years. Share his house, his meals. Speak on every subject. Then tie him up, and hold him over the volcano's edge. And on that day, you will finally meet the man.\" (Shan Yu, Firefly)\n\n\u201cOr we can watch \u2018em eat some bugs!\u201d (OP, Reddit)\n\nTell me how to make this happen. I don\u2019t want to hear that this will never work. You are probably right. But, that doesn\u2019t take any thought.

All charges combine would land him in prison for a maximum of more than 400 years.\n\nIn the subpoena it request a document regarding a possible airstrike on Iran with classified details. This document was never recovered by the FBI.\n\nThe last weekend of July 2022 Donald Trump hosted the Saudi Open at his Mar-A-Lago golf course. Not to be confused with his golf course at Bedminster New Jersey, where he buried his late first wife Ivana Trump at the first hole, for a tax break on his funeral home\/golf course. \n\nThis picture shows where some documents were located on August 8th when the FBI went to seize the classified documents and material. This is believed to be the location of these documents during Saudi Arabia's visit to Mar-A-Lago.\n\nThis is just one of the locations, a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago filled with boxes of United States secrets, ranging from nuclear capabilities of the United States and allies, as well as positions of armed forces abroad, ETC. Other locations were a ballroom stage, a storage room and 27 documents in Trump's office. Including one highly classified document in his desk drawer.\n\n\"Among the items seized, according to the list, were 18 documents marked as top secret, 54 marked as secret, 31 marked as confidential and 11,179 government documents or photographs without classification markings. Forty-eight empty folders marked as having contained classified information were also taken, though the list did not specify whether that information was recovered\" NY Times. So why is Trump only being charged with just 31 counts of retaining government documents?\n\nIn order to have a trial to convict Trump, the department of Justice has to show some form of these classified documents to a jury to prove their case. These will probably be heavily redacted or files that are no longer endangering any lives by disclosing what is in them. But there are some files that are so top secret the department of Justice is not even going to bring charges because they would then have to show a jury the substance of these files.\n\nSome believe these are initial charges and there are more charges to come. In my opinion this man will prove to be a traitor to the highest degree and I am extremely interested in seeing what more we learn after the official arrest tomorrow morning. But just a forewarning, don't be surprised if we find out there is so much more to his retention of government document"},{"author":"justin_quinnn","created_utc":1686619139,"title":"DeSantis complains about the weaponization of state power.

That may sound like a good amount of money to make but at the end of the day, setting aside $5,000 a semester for a degree is not feasible with the expenses of having a mortgage, car payments and child care costs. This program allowed people like me to have a way up. \n\nI want this to get the attention it deserves as it was such an amazing program that now puts many people, who are already working full time, back in a position of taking on large loans. \n\nThoughts?"},{"author":"WeTrudgeOn","created_utc":1690153392,"title":"They are not even hiding it anymore, full fascist dictatorship","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"Ssider69","created_utc":1690155478,"title":"Unemployment rate at or near record lows in half of US states","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Listenvan","created_utc":1690161155,"title":"Senior Columnist from Yahoo Finance, Rick Newman, joins us for an Interview to discuss 'Bidenomics'.","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"jdmorgenstern","created_utc":1690161734,"title":"Here is a mobile wallpaper you can use to support the re-election campaign:","num_comments":2,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"CrJ418","created_utc":1690166018,"title":"Ex-KGB Agent Says Trump Has Been a Russian Asset Since 1987 and Was Easily Manipulated","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Libido_Max","created_utc":1690178462,"title":"This is what the truth says.","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"DeusBex","created_utc":1690187529,"title":"'I can't die like this': Video shows trans man beaten by deputy during stop","num_comments":18,"description":""},{"author":"CommanderKiddie148","created_utc":1690196436,"title":"Fred Guttenberg on Hope after Parkland, Guns in America & Marco Rubio's ...","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"CuPride","created_utc":1690198923,"title":"Texas is using disaster declarations to install buoys and razor wire on the US-Mexico border | The Hill","num_comments":11,"description":""},{"author":"NYC_EDITS","created_utc":1690200360,"title":"China Stocks Plunge After Debt Concerns","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"joseph5991","created_utc":1690202329,"title":"Israel in turmoil!","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"isafakir","created_utc":1690202351,"title":"Let the final battle begin","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1690203042,"title":"Early votes cast in Ohio's August special election are blowing expectations out of the water","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"Ssider69","created_utc":1690203086,"title":"Bellwether?

He remembers Diaz acting \"like an older, cool brother\" and talking to 15- and 16-year-olds about clubs, like Baja Beach Club. \n\nAnother student who graduated in 1999 says she didn't have Diaz as a teacher, but remembers he was one of the younger \"cool\" teachers in a culture of \"really weird behavior.\" \n\n\"He wanted to joke with the boys on the basketball team and talk about that kind of club culture,\" she told the Herald, adding there were \"insinuations that he was one of those people who would look the other way if kidd were engaging in all kinds of stuff or [comment on] what girls were wearing.\" She says the allegations aren't surprising to people who were at the school at the time. \n\nAnother student (c\/o 2000) says, when she was 16, Diaz would ask her to stay after school with him alone - which her mom deemed inappropriate when she found out. \n\nWhile she helped with the soccer team after school, she said he would tell her her legs looked toned and she looked nice that day. She talked to a counselor to get out of that commitment. \" I feel like he would look at me a little too much. Even back then, I could feel the creeper radar.\"\n\n\"It is very ugly and very sad that one can send their children to school so they can be told about drugs. As a mother, I would be furious if a teacher talked to my child the way I remember Diaz talking.\" \n\n\n@billycorben\n@miamiherald"},{"author":"BRun1333","created_utc":1690397628,"title":"Ron DeSantis' Slavery Internship Education","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"TheMessengerNews","created_utc":1690398311,"title":"Mitch McConnell Freezes Mid-Sentence During Press Conference; Has to Be Led Away by Colleagues","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CuPride","created_utc":1690399566,"title":"Mitch McConnell escorted away from cameras after freezing during a news conference \ud83d\ude02","num_comments":220,"description":""},{"author":"CuPride","created_utc":1690401967,"title":"Trump says he would end European visas on US citizens planned for 2024 |","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"wdcmsnbcgay","created_utc":1690403174,"title":"Mitch McConnell Suffers Frightening Episode During Press Conference","num_comments":62,"description":""},{"author":"churros4burros","created_utc":1690404821,"title":"For Once, Trump Tells the Truth","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1690407220,"title":"Tommy Tuberville Takes Time Out From Wrecking the Military to Lie About Dad\u2019s Military Record.

I am very privileged to say that because of her efforts, I stand here today as an advocate, with special needs proud of her contributions.  I am honored to say that she was everybody\u2019s friend, including me. One of the first times that I got to see Miss Oliver do her magic was as speaker of the house, and her work as ace, assembly woman in the state legislation in Trenton, when she spoke, everybody paid attention and listened with such precision to understand what she wanted done for the state of New Jersey and for all citizens everywhere. I went down there once and watched the assembly in action for the full day, and it was at the height of the movement for the marriage equality, and for all citizens that I got to see Miss Oliver in person, I sat in the top row as a spectator, and as an advocate, for people with special needs, and one of the advocate advisers to garden state equality, and there was miss Oliver as speaker of the house as they took a break from their legislative duties, I called out to her and said hello Miss Oliver, she waved back at me, and it was an amazing moment. Her positive energy, and her wonderful smile was contagious in a positive way, the next time I got to see her was when she ran as governor Phil Murphy\u2018s running mate for the governor ship of New Jersey, and she came to Hackensack for a democratic breakfast as the lieutenant governor candidate, we finally got to see each other face-to-face. I talked with her for a brief time but her smile and everything and all the things that I\u2019ve accomplished because of it remembered me and we had a picture together as you can see in the memory that I have. It is one of the most treasured pictures that I have of my life. I am bewildered and stunned, beyond any measure of words, that can be said enough of her life. She was in my faith of Buddhism, what we used to say: \u201ca voice that did the Buddha\u2018s work\u201c. Her leader ship during crisis, especially the pandemic of COVID-19, is a living testament and her efforts to save many lives as possible and make clear to those who thought COVID-19 was a myth that it was real and it was a threat to our society. I am thinking about not only her friends in the assembly and Senate today in New Jersey, but mostly her family, her friends, and most of all, our beloved state of New Jersey and particularly our courageous Governor Phil Murphy who now has a difficult road ahead, but we know through his life of enduring hardship after hardship and through his strength  will make the correct decision of a successor for the lieutenant governorship,  but lieutenant governor Sheila Oliver, is an original, a one of a kind treasure of our state, and she will never be forgotten from our hearts and our memory. \nThank you, lieutenant governor Oliver, for your dedicated service and your service to our state and nation. Rest easy, Madame, the citizens have to watch from here and we will not let you down. #RipLtGoverSheilaOliver"},{"author":"AceCombat9519","created_utc":1691290175,"title":"Are voters buying Bidenomics?","num_comments":50,"description":""},{"author":"AceCombat9519","created_utc":1691293049,"title":"Kagan separates herself from Alito on Supreme Court ethics","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"badbadnogucci","created_utc":1691293662,"title":"CRITICAL RACE THEORY PETITION","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"fleeknaut","created_utc":1691307080,"title":"Only Politics, Not The Law, Can Stop Donald Trump","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"DeusBex","created_utc":1691318463,"title":"The stakes of Michigan's new 2020 indictment are deceptively high","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"CuPride","created_utc":1691321122,"title":"28 Houston school libraries will closed and turned into disciplinary spaces","num_comments":68,"description":"Republicans like the uneducated"},{"author":"Ssider69","created_utc":1691325786,"title":"DeSantis' 'anti-woke' bills are costing Florida millions of dollars in business | CNN Business","num_comments":61,"description":""},{"author":"CuPride","created_utc":1691328121,"title":"Federal appeals court upholds Connecticut law that eliminated religious vaccination exemption | AP News","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"Conjobbed","created_utc":1691330556,"title":"Imagine going to a party with Ron DeSantis.","num_comments":59,"description":""},{"author":"hornet7777","created_utc":1691330783,"title":"BTRTN: A Wolf in Sheep\u2019s Clothing -- Mike Lawler (R-NY17) Holds a Town Hall","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1691336498,"title":"Ahead of Ohio abortion vote, Republicans try to change the rules","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"shallah","created_utc":1691337290,"title":"'Will Literally Change Lives': Massachusetts Legislature Approves Universal Free School Meals","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"callycumla","created_utc":1691339958,"title":"Crying all the way to the bank","num_comments":2,"description":""},{"author":"Subizulo","created_utc":1691341211,"title":"Fascism is the Western Answer to Class Struggle","num_comments":0,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Just_perusing81","created_utc":1691341349,"title":"State Supreme Courts","num_comments":33,"description":"[deleted]"},{"author":"Ssider69","created_utc":1691343400,"title":"Pence disputes Trump legal team's claims, and says Trump asked him \"what he thought\" they should do after 2020 election","num_comments":3,"description":""},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1691344485,"title":"Trumps Lawyers ADMIT TO HIS CRIMES in Bizarre Press Appearances","num_comments":0,"description":""},{"author":"byndrsn","created_utc":1691346459,"title":"Project Funded by...","num_comments":89,"description":""},{"author":"Gooch-Grease","created_utc":1691354848,"title":"Not good","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Conjobbed","created_utc":1691359020,"title":"A U.S. soldier may have falsely reported a U.S. raid in Afghanistan while attempting to secure the adoption of a baby he found in the rubble","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"JimCripe","created_utc":1691362908,"title":"Biden to GOP: I Did it.

Soon, She'll Start 7th Grade.","num_comments":10,"description":"This is by far one of the worst stories I\u2019ve ever read.\n\nA 13-year-old girl in Mississippi\u2014who was raped\u2014has just had her baby after she wasn\u2019t allowed to get an abortion because the Republicans banned it in their state. She\u2019s 13!!! She\u2019s going into 7th grade!!! And she\u2019s a mother because of the Republican Party!\n\nThe girl in the photo is her. They named her Ashley in the article to protect her identity because of her age, but in the fall of 2022, Ashley was assaulted by a stranger in the yard outside of her home. For weeks, she didn\u2019t tell anybody what happened\u2014not even her mother. Her mother knew something was wrong. Ashley used to love going outside, making dances for her TikTok, but suddenly she refused to leave her bedroom. When she turned 13 that November, she didn\u2019t want to celebrate\u2014all she said was, \u2018It hurts.\u2019 I mean, this is heartbreaking.\n\nThen, on January 11th, Ashley began throwing up so much that her mother took her to the ER. When her blood work came back, the hospital immediately called the police. Of course, the doctors found out that Ashley was pregnant.\n\nAt the time, the doctors ordered an ultrasound for Ashley and determined she was 10-11 weeks pregnant. Again, Ashley was in shock. The doctors said it was surreal for her and that she would not even open her mouth. At their second visit about a week later, the mother asked the doctor if there was any way that they could terminate Ashley\u2019s pregnancy. At the time, just seven months ago, that could\u2019ve happened\u2014then the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and now, Ashley lives in the heart of abortion ban America.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Mississippi, and every state that borders it, banned abortion in almost all circumstances. The doctor told the mother that the closest abortion provider for Ashley would be in Chicago. At first, the mother thought she and Ashley could drive there, but it\u2019s a nine-hour drive, and the mother would have to take off work. She\u2019d have to pay for gas, food, and a place to stay for a couple of nights. Of course, not to mention the cost of the procedure itself.\n\nUnfortunately, the family did not have the funds for all of this. This has all led to Ashley, a 13-year-old girl going into 7th grade, being forced to give birth and become a mother at her age because the Republicans banned abortion in their states.\n\nThis is Ashley\u2019s story, but unfortunately, there are millions of women out there who\u2019ve experienced something similar\u2014many of them under the age of 18, well below it. Republicans would rather have 7th graders become mothers than give them the care they need! It\u2019s absolutely disgusting!

I genuinely want to learn your takes if the Secretary of the State could run in the elections and would be a good candidate.\n\nI'm not from the US. I loosely follow your political situation, and recent polls show that Biden isn't a safe bet anymore, even against Trump. More importantly, alternative candidates that could replace Biden such as: Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Harris might be even less popular, while each one having its different quirks that might not satisfy the majority.\n\nThat impression prompted me into looking of Antony Blinken's background. The guy I knew nothing about, but recalled from TV and for some reason got an idea \"yeah, why he's not running for president\"? He's a senior politician with stable approval among different political groups, but still young enough to refute most of the attacks about the age of the present President.\n\nAgain, I'd like to learn if this does make any sense to you.

However, if that\u2019s where the need is, then I will do whatever is necessary. \n\nI am in California, so I think I should spend my time volunteering for the House\/Senate\/Presidential candidates. I got an email from the Democratic Socialists of America today with \u201cleadership\u201d positions on one of their boards, and I am hoping the Democratic Party has a similar program. I\u2019ve seen leadership roles, but they all look to be paid, and therefore actually working with the DNC. \n\nIf it helps, I\u2019ve done some limited political volunteering previously and have an undergrad and law degree. \n\nThank you all for the guidance!"},{"author":"BruhHeckNah","created_utc":1695962252,"title":"If you had to choose a current Republican nominee...Who would you vote for?","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"Errol_dont_care","created_utc":1695970112,"title":"Trump Files Lawsuit Against Ex-Spy Steele Over Infamous Russia Dossier Claims","num_comments":13,"description":""},{"author":"vincevega87","created_utc":1695976659,"title":"Democrats may have already picked Joe Biden's successor","num_comments":25,"description":""},{"author":"factkeepers","created_utc":1695987865,"title":"New Report Finds Majority of Parents Believe Republican Book Bans Infringe on Their Rights","num_comments":1,"description":"[removed]"},{"author":"wenchette","created_utc":1695991774,"title":"Sen.

The next house speaker will be a republican, so the democrats should at least use this opportunity to pick one that isn\u2019t a radical. He is committed to democracy and, despite differing economic views than democrats, at least recognizes that shutdowns and defaults are radical and awful policy decisions.

I wish Biden would stare directly into the camera and explain that if you judge a nation's greatness solely based on how good their own citizens feel, without caring in the least about what other countries think, then, goddammit, North Korea would be considered a great nation.\u00a0\n\n(The president clears his throat.)\u00a0\n\nFellow Americans, from a European perspective, the only thing that sets the USA apart from superpowers like Russia and China is our history of democracy, openness, kindness towards other democratic countries, our passion for free trade, human rights, and our fairly reliable leaders. Do we want to create trust or uncertainty? Do we want to spread kindness or cultivate enmity? Do we want to stabilize or create chaos? Do we aspire to true greatness or settle for being just another authoritarian system with lots of nuclear weapons, like Russia and China? Come on, man. What truly matters is how the rest of the world sees us.\n\n(He says it again.)\u00a0\n\nThe greatness of the USA is not about what we ourselves believe, but about how the world perceives us. If we remove openness, free trade, close relationships, and cooperation with other democratic countries, the USA risks being seen as yet another unreliable and superficially great nation with lots of nuclear weapons, like Russia and China. It is important that we take into account the concerns of the global community and act accordingly if we want to preserve our position as a truly great nation. C'mon, man! We must act great.\u00a0\n\n(End of speech.)\n\nI believe it could be effective to express it this way, emphasizing that greatness lies in how the world sees them. Although it may have a different impact, potentially losing voters (after all, it is a provocative comparison), it would at least be admirably honest and quite refreshing.\u00a0\n\nAn educational campaign can be a way to convey the message. Instead of MAGA, it should be JBG. Just Be Great. Or maybe JAG. Just Act Great. Perhaps even a MAGA supporter could understand that when you start eroding democracy and deviating, either partially or completely, from the core values associated with the United States by the rest of the world, the similarities with China and Russia suddenly become strikingly numerous.\u00a0\n\nA nuclear-armed nation \u2705\u00a0\n\nAn authoritarian regime \u2705\u00a0\n\nEnormous in size \u2705\u00a0\n\nLarge population \u2705\u00a0\n\nDisregard for international condemnation \u2705\u00a0\n\nOne could possibly point out a lasting difference here, namely the countries' gun laws, and argue that Shanghai is a much nicer and safer city than Miami, but that would probably be going too far. That's where the MAGA supporter would be lost. Most likely, they would scoff at it and call it \"fake news from the biased media.\" Or, as Kim Jong-un usually says, \"hostile propaganda from our sworn enemy.\"\u00a0\n\n(All this, by the way, is coming from a person living in Sweden, quite nervous about the direction the USA, a country that I love, will take if Trump gets four more years.)"},{"author":"jonfla","created_utc":1699302582,"title":"That Scary Biden Trump Poll.

The people interviewed had NO idea who else is running in the Republican primary\u2014 and yet their opinions on \u201cwhy Biden isn\u2019t a good president\u201d are supposed to hold weight? Yeah right.\n\nThe woman couldn\u2019t even explain what she meant. The amount of \u201cI don\u2019t knows\u2026. You know\u201d or \u201cI just want someone who is a good president\u201d and then using that sentence to segue to why she is voting for Trump\u2026? Absolutely delusional.\n\nThe first guy forgot who else he liked in the Republican primary (DeSantis), and when he remembered, said \u201cI like how he is running Florida\u201d \u2014 well, awesome. Can you provide any context of what you mean, or any specifics about what you like about HOW he is running Florida?\n\nIt is absolutely maddening to listen to this woman say \u201cI want a president who wants what is best for our country\u201d and then go on some uninformed rant about why that person is Trump and how Biden isn\u2019t doing anything.\n\nClearly, these voters lack any sense of nuance or basic political common sense. What a frustrating listen to give such a platform to ineptitude.

I know some are panicking about Trump potentially winning and that\u2019s understandable, but if he doubles down on banning abortion like the other GOP candidates have, it\u2019s going to hurt him at the ballot box big time. In 2019 when his policies began to kick in, he promised to ban late term abortion and the next year he ended up losing in most of the states he carried in 2016. \n\nA couple weeks ago, we saw in Virginia and Ohio that if abortion is on the ballot, it\u2019s more than likely going to tip the scales in favor of the Democrats. Some of the swing states that Biden won in 2020 like AZ, PA, and NV have put it on the ballot, so with increased voter turnout from young people like we saw in Ohio and Virginia, it\u2019s very likely that he carries those states again. \n\nAgain, this doesn\u2019t mean we should get comfortable, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being optimistic.

In polls, the majority of Americans still say they trust former president Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the economy over Biden\u2019s.\nBoth presidents\u2019 economic records have been defined by the pandemic and its aftershocks. The covid crisis upended the job market, stoked decades-high inflation and added trillions to the federal debt.\nThe economy today is vastly different than it was in 2017, when Trump took office. But the data shows just how each administration has left its mark: Biden, by adding 14 million jobs in less than three years, bringing the Black unemployment rate to a record low and reducing student loan debt by billions.

It is important for our countries to have good communication and be able to work well. \n\nSo I come here to state as someone who would be a Democrat if I lived south of the border I am concerned. Biden is trailing his opponents everywhere he goes. He has since October been consistently behind Trump and now even behind Haley. This is very problematic as you all know a Democrat needs to win by over 3% in the PV to even have a shot at winning the election  within the last few elections. This poll has Haley up by 4 and Trump by 7. Now this is a bit of an outlier as many polls I have seen have a Trump Biden rematch more narrow but a generic Republican do much better than Biden.\n\nI come here in good faith as generally I feel Biden has been better than Obama and Clinton and way better than any Republican President in my life. Even though it failed he did try hard to get BBB, he has been much better on the drug front than anyone else since the so called drug war began, been way more pro worker than the mentioned above, good on LGBT matters and unlike Trump ended wars. Seriously I have criticized a few things he has done but I will proudly state where he has done super well as he should be credited.\n\nBut no one can ignore a 37% approval is horrible and even though there is a year left before the next election this can\u2019t be ignored as a nothing burger. This is Jimmy Carter level approval and we all know what happened in 1980 and how the 80s went. I know Obama was under water but he was at a better 44% and he was far better campaigner then Biden. I say this as someone who wants the Democratic Party in control of Congress and the Presidency but my lord what are Democrats going to do other than brush away legit issues or pivoting towards \u201cTrump bad\u201d?"},{"author":"my_vision_vivid","created_utc":1703981694,"title":"Gavin Newsom blasts effort to block Trump from California ballot: 'We defeat candidates at the polls!!'","num_comments":1,"description":""},{"author":"mchantloup5","created_utc":1703983719,"title":"Mutiny Erupts in a Michigan G.O.P.
